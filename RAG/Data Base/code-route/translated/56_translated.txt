The provisions of this chapter shall not apply to units of the National Army, Internal Security Forces, and organized marching groups. These units and groups shall keep to the right side of the road as much as possible, leaving the left side clear enough for at least one vehicle to pass. The length of each group shall not exceed twenty meters. If the length exceeds this limit, the group shall be divided into several groups with a distance of no less than thirty meters between each group and the one following. These groups shall be signaled by a white light in front and a red light in the rear, both during the night and during the day whenever visibility requires it. These lights shall be placed on the extreme left of the group.
