**English Translation:**

Periodic technical inspections shall be conducted on vehicles, trailers, and semi-trailers to ensure that they comply with legal requirements, are roadworthy, and in a satisfactory state of maintenance. These inspections do not exempt the vehicle owner from the obligation to keep their vehicle in good working order, in a satisfactory state of maintenance, and compliant with the requirements stipulated in the legislation in force. Police and National Guard officers, as well as officers from the Ministries of Transport and Environment qualified for this purpose and sworn in, may, when necessary, authorize random technical inspections. The terms of application of this chapter shall be regulated by order.
