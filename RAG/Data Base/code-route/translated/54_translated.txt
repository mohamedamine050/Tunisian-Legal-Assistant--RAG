Pedestrians must walk in designated areas such as sidewalks, dirt shoulders, and spaces designed for this purpose. In the absence of such areas or if their use is impossible, pedestrians must not walk on the road unless they are certain that they can do so safely. In this case, they must walk on the edge of the road in the direction opposite the flow of traffic. The following are considered as pedestrians: 

- Individuals pushing strollers, accompanying patients or disabled persons.
- Individuals manually operating bicycles, motorcycles, or small non-motorized vehicles.
- Elderly, disabled, and infirm persons who are being transported in a vehicle driven at walking pace.
