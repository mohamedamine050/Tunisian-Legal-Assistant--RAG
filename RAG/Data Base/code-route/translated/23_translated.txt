In all cases where the width of the road or its geometric features, or the density of traffic, do not allow for easy overtaking or passing without risk, drivers of vehicles traveling at low speed must pull over to the extreme right.
 
**The right** is a plea presented by one party to another in a dispute, when the former lacks the legally permissible evidence to prove their claim. This plea appeals to the conscience, honor, and faith of the opposing party. 

When necessary, drivers must use the shoulder or come to a complete stop as soon as possible to allow vehicles following them to pass. In all cases, absolute priority shall be given to priority vehicles and emergency vehicles, if they announce their approach using their special signals.
