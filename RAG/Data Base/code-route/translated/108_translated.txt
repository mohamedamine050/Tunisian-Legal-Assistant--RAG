If the same crime is observed multiple times within a twenty-four-hour period, and the perpetrator does not comply with the requirements of this Code between consecutive observations, only one decision regarding it shall be issued. This decision shall be a written ruling from the court resolving a legal or factual issue. 

Except for the exception stipulated in the preceding paragraph of this Chapter, punishments shall be multiplied by the number of crimes, even if these crimes are observed in a single record.
