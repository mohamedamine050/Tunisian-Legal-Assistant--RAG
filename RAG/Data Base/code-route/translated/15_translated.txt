Every driver must comply with the provisions relating to speed limits set by order. The Minister responsible for equipment may, on roads belonging to the public domain of the State, take stricter measures if road safety requires it. The Minister of the Interior may take similar measures outside urban areas in specific locations for a period not exceeding one month if the security or public order interests require it. These provisions do not apply to drivers of priority vehicles and rapid intervention vehicles when they are heading to locations where their intervention is necessary, when using their special signals. A list of these vehicles, their equipment requirements, and the conditions for using their signals are set by order.
