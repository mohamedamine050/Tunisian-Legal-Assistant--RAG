In all cases where the court issues its final judgment dismissing the lawsuit, the decision to withdraw is not subject to any form of appeal. 

**Notes:**
* The Arabic text provides definitions for "lawsuit" and "claim" which are not directly translated to avoid repetition and keep the translation concise. 
* The phrase "not subject to any form of appeal" is used consistently to translate the Arabic phrase "غير قابلة لأي وجه من أوجه الطعن."
* The French text in brackets is not translated.
