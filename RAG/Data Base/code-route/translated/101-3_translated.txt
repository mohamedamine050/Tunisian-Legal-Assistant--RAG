Added by Law No. 66 of 2009 dated August 12, 2009. - The vehicle owner may challenge the violation within a period not exceeding twenty days from the date of notification. The challenge is made using a form that includes a statement of the reasons for the challenge, accompanied by supporting evidence and, where necessary, a statement of the full identity of the offending driver. The challenge form is submitted by registered mail with acknowledgement of receipt to the entity that issued the notification of the violation. In this case, the vehicle owner must secure the amount of the fine with a financial collection office.

The challenge file is referred to the District Governor in the place of residence of the challenger. If the challenge is rejected by the District Governor, the security is considered to have been definitively appropriated as final collection of the fine amount. If the challenge form does not specify the receipt number confirming the securing of the fine and its date, the challenge is considered inadmissible, and the traffic department shall notify the challenger by registered mail of the inadmissibility of their challenge.

If no challenge is submitted within the legal time limit, and after five days from the end of this time limit, a copy of the notification of the violation is sent to the financial collector, and the fine amount is doubled if it is not paid upon expiry of five days from the date the financial collector received a copy of the notification. If the fine amount remains unpaid one month after the financial collector received a copy of the notification, the financial collector shall forward a copy of the notification to the National Register of Traffic Offenses, and the driving license shall be considered suspended and invalid for driving from this date until the fine amount is paid or the situation is resolved.
