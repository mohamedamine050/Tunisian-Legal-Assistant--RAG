Pedestrians shall not cross the road unless they are certain of their ability to do so without any risk, taking into account visibility conditions, the distance separating them from vehicles, and the speed of such vehicles.  They must use designated pedestrian crossings if such crossings are located within a distance of fifty meters from them.  Pedestrians must cross at road intersections lacking designated pedestrian crossings by proceeding perpendicularly across the portion of the road connecting the sidewalks.  If traffic is regulated by a designated officer or by traffic signals, pedestrians must not cross the road until the signal permitting their crossing is given.  Outside of road intersections, pedestrians must cross the road perpendicularly to its axis.  Pedestrians are prohibited from walking in the road or at intersections unless there is a designated pedestrian crossing allowing direct passage.  They must encircle such areas or intersections by crossing the required portion of the road.  When crossing a road that has multiple lanes or paved areas, pedestrians must not enter the subsequent portion of the road until they have adhered to the rules stated in this chapter.
