Road users must conduct themselves in a manner that does not pose a hazard or obstruction to traffic. In particular, they must exercise caution and reduce speed to facilitate the passage of pedestrians, and stop when necessary, especially when children, persons with disabilities, and the elderly are approaching or crossing a street.
