The provisions of this Code do not prevent municipal authorities from taking measures stricter than those provided in this Code, within the limits of their jurisdiction and whenever the interests of security or public order require it. Decisions taken by municipal authorities pursuant to this Chapter shall not be enforceable unless they are endorsed by the Governors.
