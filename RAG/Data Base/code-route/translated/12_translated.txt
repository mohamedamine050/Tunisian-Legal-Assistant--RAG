Any structure, monument, or flat land erected in a temple, a square, or at a crossroads shall be subject to the oath which one of the litigants or disputing parties may direct to the other to settle the dispute between them, in the absence of legally admissible evidence to prove his claim, relying on the conscience, honor, and religion of that litigant, unless there is a sign indicating otherwise.
