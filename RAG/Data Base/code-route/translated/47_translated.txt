The Minister responsible for Infrastructure, or the Governors, or the Mayors, as per the classification of roads under their purview, shall each take all necessary measures to ensure traffic safety on bridges that do not meet all the conditions for guaranteeing safe passage. The data regarding the maximum authorized load of these bridges, as well as the measures implemented for their protection and traffic flow, shall be publicly announced through signs placed at the entrances of the bridges, in a manner that allows every driver to clearly see these signs. Regional Infrastructure Directors, Municipal Works Directors, and Heads of National Security and National Guard Zones may, in urgent or imminent danger situations, take temporary measures deemed necessary and suitable to preserve public security and safety, provided that they inform the competent authorities thereof.
