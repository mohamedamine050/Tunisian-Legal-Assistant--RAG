Every driver intending to overtake another vehicle must ensure their ability to do so safely and must take the following precautions:

1. **Before Overtaking:**

- Ensure that there are no circumstances preventing overtaking.
- Ensure that the lane is clear for a sufficient distance to allow for the overtaking maneuver without endangering oncoming vehicles, taking into account the speed difference between their vehicle and the vehicle to be overtaken.
- Ensure that the driver ahead and the driver behind them have not commenced any overtaking maneuver.
- Ensure that they can safely return to the original lane.
- Signal their intention to overtake other road users.

2. **During Overtaking:**

- Maintain a safe lateral distance from the vehicle being overtaken.
- Complete the overtaking maneuver as quickly as possible.

3. **After Overtaking:**

- Signal their intention to return to the original lane to other road users, unless continuing to overtake another vehicle or changing direction.
- Only return to the original lane after ensuring that doing so is safe.
