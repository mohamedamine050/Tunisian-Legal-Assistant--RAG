Every driver must:

1. Possess the necessary physical and mental qualifications, be in a physical and mental state that allows him to drive, and always be in control of his vehicle or capable of driving his animals. 
2. Refrain from driving particularly:

- If he is under the influence of alcohol.
- If he has taken narcotic drugs or substances that are likely to affect his qualifications.
- If he is in a state of fatigue. The percentage of pure alcohol in the blood in a state of intoxication, as well as the conditions and circumstances in which investigations aimed at proving the state of intoxication are conducted, shall be determined by order.
3. Take all necessary precautions to avoid obstructing his movement and limiting his field of vision, whether due to the number or position of passengers, the nature of the goods being transported, or the presence of opaque objects on the windows.
4. Always ensure that he can drive without causing damage to roads, structures, plantations, or overhead equipment due to the dimensions of the vehicle or its load, or posing a danger to other road users. The conditions for applying the last paragraph of this chapter shall be determined by order.
