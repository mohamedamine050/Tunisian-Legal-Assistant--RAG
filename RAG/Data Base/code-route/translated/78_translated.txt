Each license is assigned a point balance.  A number of these points are deducted when a driver commits a traffic offense. Under certain conditions, some or all of the deducted points may be restored before the point balance is exhausted.  A driving license loses its validity and is permanently withdrawn from its holder when the point balance is exhausted.  A new driving license may only be obtained after passing a driving test. The conditions for applying this section shall be determined by order.
