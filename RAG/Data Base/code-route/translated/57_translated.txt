The driving of animal herds on roads must be undertaken by a sufficient number of drivers in a manner that does not result in any disruption to traffic. Drivers of such herds shall move them along the roadside, and if this is not feasible, they shall not allow them to occupy more than half of the road's width. It is not permissible for anyone under the age of sixteen years to drive a herd.
