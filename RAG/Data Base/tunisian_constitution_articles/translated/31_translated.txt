## English Translation:

**Withdrawal of Nationality**

Nationality is a legal and political bond between an individual and a specific state, which includes the individual within the state's population. This bond establishes reciprocal rights and obligations between them. 

A citizen is any individual who enjoys all rights, whether civil, political, economic, social, cultural, or solidarity rights, in the state to which they belong.

The withdrawal of Tunisian nationality is not subject to any form of appeal.
