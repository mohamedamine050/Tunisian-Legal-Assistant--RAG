## English Translation:

A judge shall not be transferred without his consent, nor dismissed, nor can he be suspended from work or relieved of his duties, or subjected to any penalty, except in the cases specified by law. A judge enjoys criminal immunity, and cannot be prosecuted or arrested unless his immunity is lifted.

In the event of being caught red-handed committing a crime, he may be arrested and the Judicial Council to which he is accountable shall be notified, which shall decide on the request to lift immunity.

The provisions of the first paragraph of this section shall not prevent the transfer of a judge to another position, taking into account the requirements of the service.

The service is understood to be the need to fill a vacancy or to be appointed to new judicial positions, or to address an increase in the volume of work.

All judges are equal in meeting the requirements of the service, and a judge cannot be called upon to change his place of work to meet the requirements of the service unless it is proven that there are no volunteers to join the position in question. For this purpose, judges working in the nearest judicial district shall be called upon, with rotation being adopted, and if necessary, a lottery shall be conducted.

In this case, the duration of service to meet the requirements of the service cannot exceed one year unless the judge in question expresses a clear desire to remain in the position he was transferred to or appointed to.
