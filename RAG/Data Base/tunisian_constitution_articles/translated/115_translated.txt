The House of Representatives and the National Council of Regions and Provinces, meeting jointly, may oppose the Government in continuing to assume its responsibilities by submitting a Motion of Censure. 

If it appears to them that the Government's actions violate the State's general policy, a Motion of Censure may be submitted. However, such a Motion of Censure may only be submitted if it is substantiated and signed by at least half of the members of the House of Representatives and half of the members of the National Council of Regions and Provinces. Voting on the Motion of Censure cannot take place until forty-eight hours after its submission.

The President of the Republic shall accept the resignation of the Government submitted by its Prime Minister if the Motion of Censure is approved by a two-thirds majority of the members of the two Houses meeting jointly.
