## English Translation of the Arabic Legal Text:

The law authorizes the State's resources and expenditures in accordance with the provisions of the Basic Budget Law.

The People's Assembly approves the Finance Bills and the closing of the budget, examining the revenues, expenditures, and conditions of any project during a specific period, subject to the conditions set forth in the Basic Budget Law.

The Finance Bill is submitted to the Assembly by no later than October 15th and is approved by no later than December 10th.

The President of the Republic may return the Bill to the Assembly for a second reading within two days following the Assembly's approval.

If the Bill is returned, the Assembly shall reconvene for a second deliberation within three days following the exercise of the right to return.

The President of the Republic, one-third of the members of the People's Assembly, or one-third of the members of the National Council of Regions and Governorates may, within three days following the Assembly's second approval after return, or following the expiry of the deadlines for exercising the right to return without its exercise, challenge the constitutionality of the provisions of the Finance Bill before the Constitutional Court. The Constitutional Court shall rule within five days following the challenge.

If the Court finds the Bill unconstitutional, it shall transmit its decision to the President of the Republic, who shall in turn transmit it to the President of the People's Assembly and the President of the National Council of Regions and Governorates, within two days of the Court's decision. The two Assemblies shall approve the Bill within three days of receiving the Constitutional Court's decision.

Upon the confirmation of the constitutionality of the Bill, or its second approval after return, or the expiration of the deadlines for return and constitutional challenges, the President of the Republic shall promulgate the Finance Bill within two days. In all cases, the promulgation shall be completed no later than December 31st.

If the Finance Bill is not approved by December 31st, the project may be implemented with regard to expenditures, in installments of three months, renewable by order. The resources are collected according to existing legislation.
