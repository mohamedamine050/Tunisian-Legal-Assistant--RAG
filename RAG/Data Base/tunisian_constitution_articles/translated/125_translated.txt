## English Translation:

The Constitutional Court is an independent judicial body composed of nine members appointed by decree.  The first third are the most senior presidents of the chambers of the Court of Cassation, the second third are the most senior presidents of the chambers of the Court of Cassation or the advisory chambers of the Administrative Court, and the final third are the most senior members of the Court of Audit.

The members of the Constitutional Court elect a president and vice-president from among themselves in accordance with the law.

If a member reaches retirement age, they are automatically replaced by the next most senior member. In all cases, the duration of membership must not be less than one year.
