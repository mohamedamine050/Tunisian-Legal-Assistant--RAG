## English Translation: 

Any law declared unconstitutional by the Court of Cassation shall be referred to the President of the Republic, and from there to the House of Representatives and the National Council of Regions and Provinces, or to one of them as the case may be, for renewed deliberation in accordance with the Constitutional Court's decision. The President of the Republic shall return the law to the Constitutional Court before its final approval for renewed review of its conformity with the Constitution or its compliance with its provisions. 

If the draft law is approved in an amended form following its return, and the Court of Cassation has previously declared its constitutionality, the President of the Republic shall submit it to the Constitutional Court before its final approval.
