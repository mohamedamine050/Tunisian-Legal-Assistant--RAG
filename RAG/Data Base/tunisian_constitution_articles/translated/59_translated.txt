## English Translation:

Every citizen or national who possesses Tunisian nationality and has attained the full age of eighteen years, and who meets the conditions stipulated by the Electoral Law, is considered an elector. 

**Explanation of Terms:**

* **"مواطن" (Citizen)**: This is a general term referring to a person who holds full rights and responsibilities in a state. 
* **"مواطنة" (National)**: This refers specifically to a person who holds the nationality of a particular state. This distinction is important as some states may grant citizenship to non-nationals who meet certain criteria. 
* **"يُطلـق علـى كل فـرد يتمتـع بكافـة الحقـوق" (Every individual enjoying all rights)**: This phrase emphasizes that an individual must hold full rights, both civil, political, economic, social, cultural, and solidarity rights, within the state they belong to. 
* **"شروط التي يحددها القانون الانتخابي" (conditions stipulated by the Electoral Law)**: This refers to any additional requirements set by the Electoral Law for an individual to be eligible to vote. 

**Note:**

* The original Arabic text uses the term "مواطن" twice. The second usage was replaced with "national" to avoid repetition and maintain clarity. 
* The original text mentions a variety of rights (civil, political, etc.). However, the translation focuses on the key aspect of holding full rights to be eligible as an elector. 
* This translation avoids using special characters and maintains a concise, professional tone.
