## English Translation:

The President of the Republic ratifies treaties and authorizes their publication.

Ratification of treaties concerning the state's borders, commercial treaties, treaties related to international organization, those concerning the state's financial commitments, and treaties containing provisions of a legislative nature is not permitted without the approval of the House of Representatives.

Treaties shall not come into effect until they have been ratified and provided that they are implemented by the other party.

Treaties ratified by the President of the Republic and approved by the House of Representatives are superior to laws but subordinate to the Constitution.
