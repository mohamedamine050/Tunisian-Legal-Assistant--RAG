## English Translation:

No restrictions may be placed on the rights and freedoms guaranteed by this Constitution except by law and for a necessity dictated by national defense or public security, or for the protection of public health or the rights of others, or for the protection of public morals.

**The law is a rule agreed upon by a competent authority that regulates the behavior of citizens and institutions.**

These restrictions must not affect the essence of the rights and freedoms guaranteed by this Constitution and must be justified by their objectives and consistent with their reasons.

No amendment may diminish the gains of human rights and freedoms guaranteed in this Constitution. All judicial bodies shall protect these rights and freedoms from any violation.
