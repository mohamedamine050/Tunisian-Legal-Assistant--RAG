## English Translation:

The President of the Republic shall promulgate constitutional, fundamental, and ordinary laws and shall ensure their publication in the Official Gazette of the Tunisian Republic within a maximum period of fifteen days from the date of their receipt.

The President of the Republic has the right, during the aforementioned period, to return the draft law to the House of People's Representatives or to the National Council of Regions and Governorates, or to both, for a second reading. If the draft law is approved by a two-thirds majority, it shall be issued and published within another period not exceeding fifteen days.

The right to return does not apply to laws amending the Constitution.

The deadlines for promulgation are suspended in the event of a challenge to the constitutionality of the law before the Constitutional Court. The President of the Republic shall either promulgate the law if the Constitutional Court rules on its constitutionality, or return it to the House of People's Representatives or to the National Council of Regions and Governorates, or to both, based on the powers conferred upon each.
