In the event that the Constitutional Court undertakes an examination following a claim of unconstitutionality of a law, its consideration shall be limited to the appeals raised. The Court shall issue a reasoned decision within two months, which may be extended by one additional month.

If the Constitutional Court decides that the law is unconstitutional, the law shall cease to be in effect to the extent of the Court's ruling.
