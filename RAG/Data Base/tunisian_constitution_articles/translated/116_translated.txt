## English Translation:

The President of the Republic, if a second vote of no confidence is directed against the government during the same parliamentary term, may either accept the government's resignation or dissolve the House of People's Representatives, the National Council of Regions and Provinces, or one of them.

The decree concerning dissolution shall stipulate the summoning of voters to hold new elections for the members of the House of People's Representatives and the members of the National Council of Regions and Provinces, or one of them, within a period not exceeding thirty days.

In the event of the dissolution of both Councils or one of them, the President of the Republic may issue decrees subject to the approval of the House of People's Representatives and the National Council of Regions and Provinces, or one of them only, as per the powers delegated to each of these Councils.
