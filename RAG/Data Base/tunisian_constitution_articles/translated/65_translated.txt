No deputy may be pursued or arrested during their term of office due to criminal proceedings unless the House of Representatives lifts their immunity. However, in the case of being caught in the act of committing a crime, they may be arrested, and the House must be immediately informed. The arrest will continue if the House lifts the immunity.

During the House's recess, its Bureau acts on its behalf.
