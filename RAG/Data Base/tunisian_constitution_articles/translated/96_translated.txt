## English Translation:

To the President of the Republic, in the case of imminent danger:

Imminent danger is a danger that is immediate and imminent in a grave manner. It threatens individuals and property in a way that cannot be disregarded. It poses a threat to the very existence of the Republic, the security of the country, and its independence, rendering the normal functioning of the state apparatus impossible. In such a case, the President of the Republic shall take extraordinary measures after consulting with:

* The Prime Minister,
* The Speaker of the House of Representatives,
* The President of the National Council of Regions and Provinces.

The President shall issue a public statement regarding these measures.

In this situation, the President of the Republic shall not have the power to dissolve either House of Parliament or both. Neither shall any motion of censure be submitted against the government.

These measures shall cease upon the removal of the reasons that necessitated them. The President of the Republic shall issue a public statement to this effect, addressing the people, the House of Representatives, and the National Council of Regions and Provinces.
