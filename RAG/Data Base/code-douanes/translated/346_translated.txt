A judgment ordering the confiscation of seized goods may be sought against the drivers or declarants of the means of transport, without the customs administration being obligated to include the owners in the dispute, even if their identities are known. However, if the owners of these goods intervene or are requested as guarantors by those from whom the goods were seized, the competent courts shall decide, in accordance with the law, on the interventions or requests for guarantees.
