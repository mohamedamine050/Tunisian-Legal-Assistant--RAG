If the determination of value by customs is not possible by applying the provisions of Article 23 of this Code, then the provisions of Articles 25, 26, 27, and 28 of this Code shall be applied successively until the first Article among these Articles that allows its determination is reached, except in the case of reversing the order of Articles 27 and 28 at the request of the supplier.  The determination of value by customs within the framework of the order set forth in this paragraph may not proceed from one Article to the next directly unless its determination according to that Article is impossible.
