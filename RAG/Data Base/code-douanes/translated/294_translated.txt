Goods aboard vessels legally deemed to have made a distress landing are not subject to any duty or payment unless the captain is compelled to sell them. Otherwise, the goods may be unloaded and stored, at the expense of the ship's masters or outfitters, in a place secured with two different keys, one held by the customs authority or by a person designated by the customs authorities, until re-exportation. The ship's masters or outfitters may then re-ship the aforementioned goods after authorization in accordance with the current procedures and administrative decisions of a general nature and not relating to a specific person.
