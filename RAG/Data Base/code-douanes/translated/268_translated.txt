Customs officers may not open packages in deposit and examine their contents except in the presence of the owner or consignee.  In the event that this is not possible, it may be done in the presence of a person appointed by the President of the First Instance Court having territorial jurisdiction over the customs office concerned, upon request of the Customs Collector.
