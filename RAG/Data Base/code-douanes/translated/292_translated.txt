1.  The towing operations specified are those carried out by Tunisian vessels:

    a. Within Tunisian ports or territorial waters.

    b. Between Tunisian ports.

2. However, the Minister of Transport may, by means of special licenses, permit foreign-flagged vessels to carry out the aforementioned towing operations, if Tunisian towing vessels are unavailable or if their number is insufficient in Tunisian ports.

3. Foreign towing vessels are permitted entry into Tunisian ports if they are towing vessels or boats arriving from a foreign port or from outside Tunisian territorial waters, or if they have come to tow vessels or boats for the purpose of conveying them to a foreign port or outside Tunisian territorial waters. In both cases, the operations carried out by these vessels within the ports must be limited to guiding the towed vessel to its mooring place or removing it therefrom.
