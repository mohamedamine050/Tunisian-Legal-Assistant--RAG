Regarding equipment intended for work, and in the absence of conflicting legal provisions, crimes punishable by death or imprisonment exceeding five years are classified as felonies within the meaning of this law.  Crimes punishable by imprisonment exceeding fifteen days but not exceeding five years, or by a fine exceeding sixty dinars, are classified as misdemeanors.

If no preference is given, upon entry under the temporary admission system during the first five years, they are subject to the payment of a duty equal to one sixtieth (1/60) of the total duties and taxes due, for each month or part thereof of the calendar year during which this equipment remains under the temporary admission system.

The duty is payable upon admission and upon each renewal.

The payment of this duty ceases when the equipment is placed under the customs warehouse system, starting from the month following the date of its placement under this system.

Equipment whose ownership remains with a non-resident supplier, imported under this system for use in producing goods exclusively intended for export, is exempt from the payment of this duty.
