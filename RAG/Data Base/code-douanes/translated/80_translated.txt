Regardless of the provisions of Articles 69 and 77 of this Code, the sea or air carrier associated with the integrated automated system for processing foreign trade procedures may lodge a cargo manifest with customs before the arrival of the vessel or aircraft using reliable electronic means, in accordance with the legislation concerning electronic exchanges.

The process of lodging a pre-arrival cargo manifest electronically exempts [the carrier] from undertaking any other procedure having the same purpose.

The pre-arrival cargo manifest shall be considered null and void in the event that the vessel or aircraft does not arrive.

The procedures for implementing the provisions of this Article shall be determined by order.
