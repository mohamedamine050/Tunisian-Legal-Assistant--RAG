1.  Permits cannot be amended after registration. However, declarants may be authorized to amend the data contained in the permit without penalty, provided this is done before the release of the goods and provided that customs authorities have not found the elements contained in the permit to be incorrect, or have not notified the declarant of their decision to examine the goods.

No amendment resulting in a change in the declared type of goods to a type different from that originally declared is permitted.

2. Permits cannot be cancelled after registration. However, customs authorities may, at the request of the declarant, authorize the cancellation of the permit in the following cases:

a. Goods presented for export which have not actually been exported.

b. Imported goods found to be non-compliant with the legislation and regulations in force, particularly those relating to technical, health, veterinary, phytosanitary, consumer protection, and fraud prevention controls.

c. Goods imported by post which have been returned to the sender by the postal services.

d. Goods incorrectly declared under a specific customs regime instead of another, provided that the goods have not been released.

e. Goods which, at the time of their import, were damaged or non-compliant with the terms of the contract, provided that they have not been released and that customs authorities have not found the data contained in the permit to be incorrect.

f. Goods declared upon import which have not actually arrived.

g. Goods that have been declared but are in a special situation for which the declarant is not responsible.

The cancellation of the permit shall extinguish its effects for the declarant, except for any consequences arising from disputes that may result from this permit.

3. The methods of implementing the provisions of this chapter shall be determined by a decision of the Minister of Finance.
