1. In urgent cases, the Customs Administration may request authorization from the President of the Court of First Instance to conduct a precautionary seizure of movable and immovable property belonging to those suspected of a crime, before a conviction is rendered, based on the seizure report.  The precautionary seizure empowers a creditor holding an enforceable instrument to place the debtor's movable property under the court's control.


2. Authorizations issued are executed regardless of any appeals. The court may authorize the lifting of the seizure if the party subject to the seizure provides sufficient guarantee. Any request to lift the seizure is referred to the competent court.


3. The precautionary seizure is automatically lifted upon issuance of a judgment of acquittal or extinction of the action.
