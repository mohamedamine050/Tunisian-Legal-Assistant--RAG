Customs duties and taxes shall be refunded in the cases set forth in Article 15 of this Code, based on a reasoned written request submitted by the person who paid the duties and taxes sought to be refunded, to the head of the customs office where the collection was made, against a receipt.

The head of the relevant customs office shall conduct the necessary verification to ascertain the validity of the refund request.

The head of the customs office must respond to the refund request within a maximum period of six months from the date of its submission.

The response shall be reasoned in case of a total or partial rejection of the refund request.

Failure to respond within the time limit set out in this Article shall be considered an implicit rejection of the refund request.

The refund shall be effected directly by the relevant customs collector after endorsement of the refund decision by the regional director of customs having jurisdiction, through direct deduction from the accounts pertaining to the duties and taxes subject to the refund.
