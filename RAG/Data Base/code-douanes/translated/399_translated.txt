1.  Any violation considered as the import or export of prohibited goods without notification shall be classified as follows:  Crimes, within the meaning of this law, are those that warrant punishment by death or imprisonment exceeding five years.  Offenses are those that warrant punishment by imprisonment exceeding fifteen days but not exceeding five years, or a fine exceeding sixty dinars.  Infractions are those that warrant punishment not exceeding fifteen days' imprisonment or sixty dinars fine. (Article 122, Code of Criminal Procedure)  Legislative or regulatory provisions prohibiting import under any customs system, prohibiting export or re-export, or subjecting export or re-export operations to the payment of duties or fees or the completion of specific procedures, shall apply if fraud or attempted fraud against customs offices occurs, unless this Code provides specific penalties for these violations.

2. If goods prohibited from export are exported upon exit under an exceptional license to a specific country, and are then re-exported after reaching another country, the exporter shall be punished with the penalty prescribed for export without notification if it is proven that this re-exportation occurred on his orders, at his direction, or with his participation; likewise, if it is proven that he benefited from it or was aware of the planned re-exportation at the time of export.
