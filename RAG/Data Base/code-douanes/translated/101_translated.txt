A detailed declaration of imported or exported goods must be made by their owners or by persons or entities holding a license to practice as a customs broker or holding a permit to carry out customs clearance operations, in accordance with the conditions stipulated in Articles 102 to 107 of this Code.

The owner of the goods must prove their ownership to the customs authorities by submitting commercial documents proving that the purchase or sale of these goods was made in their own name or on their behalf.

The owner of the goods may, by virtue of a power of attorney issued by them, authorize the agent in their exclusive service to make the declaration on their behalf.

Carriers, custodians, travelers, and border residents are considered owners with regard to the goods, items, and materials they transport or possess.
