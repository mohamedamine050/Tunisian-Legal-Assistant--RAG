1. The replacement goods must have the same classification in the product clearance classification, the same commercial quality, and the same technical characteristics as the exported goods, assuming the latter undergo the planned repair.

2. If the exported goods were used before export, the replacement goods must also be used and cannot be new.  However, customs authorities may grant exceptions to this rule if the replacement goods were delivered free of charge pursuant to a contractual or legal warranty obligation or due to a manufacturing defect. In this case, the replacement goods must be delivered within twelve months following the date of the detailed declaration of first use for consumption of the exported goods, unless there are conflicting contractual clauses.
