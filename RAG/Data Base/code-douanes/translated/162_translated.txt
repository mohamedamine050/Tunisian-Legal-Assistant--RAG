1. Transshipment is the customs system by which, and under the supervision of customs authorities, goods are unloaded from the means of transport used for import and loaded onto the means of transport used for export.

The transshipment operation takes place in the area designated for these operations, belonging to the customs office which is simultaneously the office of entry and exit of goods.

Customs authorities may authorize the performance of transshipment operations in places designated by them for this purpose.

2. Goods accepted under the transshipment system are not subject to the payment of duties and taxes, subject to the conditions determined by the customs authorities.

3. Customs authorities may accept, as a declaration of goods for transshipment, the commercial document or transport document relating to the shipment concerned, provided that it contains all the data required by the customs authorities.

4. In cases where they deem it necessary, customs authorities may take measures upon import to verify the export of the goods to be transshipped.

5. Customs authorities may, at the request of the interested party, authorize the subjection of goods intended for transshipment to operations that may facilitate their export, within the limits of possibility and according to the conditions they determine.
