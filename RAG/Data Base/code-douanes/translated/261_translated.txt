The temporary export system permits the export of Tunisian goods or goods that have been Tunisianized for temporary use outside the customs territory, suspending the duties and taxes payable upon export, on condition that they are re-imported without any changes, except for normal wear and tear resulting from their authorized use under this system.  The temporary export system allows export outside the customs territory: (a) for equipment, machinery, products, and animals for temporary use; (b) for personal effects, including means of transport, for individuals ordinarily resident in Tunisia and temporarily residing outside the customs territory.
