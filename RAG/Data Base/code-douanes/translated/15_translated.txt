The Customs Administration may refund the duties and taxes collected upon importation if it is established that:

A - The amount of duties and taxes was collected in error or at a rate higher than legally required.

B - The goods were damaged or non-compliant with the contract terms on the date of importation.

C - The goods were incorrectly declared for consumption instead of another customs regime.

D - The goods declared upon importation did not actually arrive, while the duties and taxes levied thereon were collected.

E - The goods are in a special situation not caused by the importer, which may result in a refund of the collected duties and taxes.


The refund of duties and taxes, in the case stipulated in point (B), shall be conditional upon:

- Either re-exporting the goods outside the customs territory or to the foreign supplier.

- Or their destruction under the supervision of the customs authorities, with payment of the duties and taxes due on any residue or waste resulting from this destruction.


The methods of implementing the provisions of this chapter shall be determined by a decision of the Minister of Finance.
