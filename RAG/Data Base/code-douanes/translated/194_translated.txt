The Customs authorities may authorize the disposal of a processed product from an establishment operating under the total export processing system for the purpose of completing its manufacture to:

- Another establishment operating under the same system.

- Or an establishment operating under another suspensive system, provided that the final destination of this product is export.

The Customs authorities may authorize establishments benefiting from the total export processing system to complete the manufacturing process under a contract with an establishment operating under one of the processing systems under Customs supervision or with an establishment operating under the effective processing system.  A contract is a legally binding agreement that obligates the contracting parties and defines their obligations and rights with respect to the specific transaction.
