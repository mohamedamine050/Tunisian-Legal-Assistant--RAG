1. The seized goods and means of transport shall be conveyed, as far as circumstances permit, to the nearest customs office or unit, or to the nearest financial collection office, where the officers who effected the seizure shall immediately draw up their report.

2. If there are several customs offices or units, or financial collection offices, in one location, the report may be drawn up equally at any of those offices or units, or financial collection offices.

3. If the seizure takes place at a residence, the report may be drawn up on the spot.

4. If it is impossible to transfer the seized goods immediately, they may be secured in the custody of the suspect (meaning suspicion of committing a crime before the charges are filed) or any other person present at or near the place of seizure.
