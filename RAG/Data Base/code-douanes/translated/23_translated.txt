1. The customs value of imported goods is the contractual value, i.e., the price agreed upon by the contracting parties, whether paid or payable upon the sale of goods for export to Tunisia, after adjustment in accordance with Articles 30 and 31, provided that:

a. There are no restrictions relating to the buyer's disposal of the goods or their use, except for:

- Restrictions imposed or stipulated by laws or regulations, administrative decisions of a general nature not relating to a specific person, currently in force in Tunisia;

- Restrictions defining the geographical area where the goods may be resold;

- Restrictions that do not materially affect the value of the goods.

b. The sale or price is not subject to conditions or services whose value cannot be determined in relation to the goods to be assessed.

c. No part of the proceeds from the resale, disposal, or subsequent use of the goods by the buyer directly or indirectly reverts to the seller, unless an appropriate adjustment can be made in accordance with Article 30 of this Code.

d. The seller and buyer are not related, or if they are, the contractual value is acceptable for customs purposes in accordance with paragraph (2) of this Article.


2. a. To determine whether the contractual value is acceptable for the purposes of applying paragraph (1) of this Article, the existence of a relationship between the seller and buyer as referred to in Article 22 of this Code does not in itself constitute sufficient grounds for considering the contractual value unacceptable. In this case, the specific circumstances of the sale are verified, and the contractual value is accepted unless those relationships affect the price. If customs authorities have reasons, based on information provided by the importer or otherwise, to believe that those relationships affect the price, those reasons are communicated to the importer, and the customs authorities allow the importer a reasonable time to respond. If the importer so requests, these reasons are communicated to him in writing.


b. In a sale between related parties, the contractual value is accepted, and the goods are assessed in accordance with paragraph (1) of this Article if the importer proves that this value is very close to one of the values mentioned below, occurring at the same time or approximately at the same time:

- The contractual value when selling identical or similar goods to unrelated buyers for export to Tunisia;

- The customs value of identical or similar goods as determined in accordance with Article 27 of this Code;

- The customs value of identical or similar goods as determined in accordance with Article 28 of this Code.

When applying the above criteria, the differences proven between the commercial levels, quantities, and elements mentioned in Article 30 of this Code, and the costs incurred by the seller in sales where the seller and buyer are not related that are not incurred by the seller in sales where the seller and buyer are related, must be taken into account.


c. The criteria set out in paragraph (2)(b) of this Article are used on the initiative of the importer and for comparison purposes only.  No alternative values may be established under the same provisions.


3. a. The price paid or payable is the total price paid or payable by the buyer to or for the benefit of the seller for the imported goods. Payment need not necessarily be in cash but may be by letter of credit or other negotiable instruments and may be direct or indirect.


b. The cost of activities carried out by the buyer on its own behalf, including activities relating to commercial promotion, are not considered indirect payments to the seller, except those for which an adjustment is decided in accordance with Article 30 of this Code, whether or not the seller benefits from them, and the costs of these activities are not added to the price paid or payable when determining the customs value of the imported goods.
