1. A fine of one hundred dinars shall be imposed for each violation of the provisions of the laws and regulations entrusted to the customs administration for enforcement, unless this Code prescribes heavier penalties for such violation.

2. The same fine shall be imposed for:

a. Any omission or error in the information required to be included in declarations, when such error has no effect on the application of duties or prohibitions;

b. Any omission of registration in the registers;

c. Any violation of the provisions of Articles 69 and 74, paragraph 1, and 293 of this Code, or of the decisions issued pursuant to Article 112 (paragraph ) of this Code.

d. Any violation of quality and packaging rules required upon import or export, when such violation does not aim at, or does not lead to, obtaining a refund of duties or payments, or benefiting from an exemption or tax reduction or a financial privilege.

Note:  The Arabic text includes a definition distinguishing crimes (جنح, جنايات, مخالفات) which I have omitted as it was not directly related to the specific penalties described in the numbered sections.
