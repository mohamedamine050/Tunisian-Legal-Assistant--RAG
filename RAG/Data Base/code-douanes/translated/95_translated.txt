Every person carrying out activities involving the storage, manufacture, processing, sale, or purchase of goods within logistics activity zones must maintain a materials accounting record in accordance with the model approved by Customs authorities.  The goods must be included in this accounting record from the moment they enter the premises of that person. This accounting record must allow Customs authorities to identify the goods and track their movements.
