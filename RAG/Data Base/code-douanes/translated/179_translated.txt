1. Private warehousing is granted to:

- Natural or legal persons who professionally store goods on behalf of others as a primary or secondary activity.  In this case, the warehouse is called a "private warehouse on behalf of others".

- Industrial or commercial entities for their own use, for the purpose of storing goods intended for resale or processing upon exit from the warehouse. In this case, the warehouse is called a "private warehouse for personal account".

2. The private warehouse system on behalf of others may also be granted for the acceptance of goods imported within the framework of exhibitions, markets, competitions, or other events.

A private warehouse is considered a specialized warehouse when it is equipped to accept:
