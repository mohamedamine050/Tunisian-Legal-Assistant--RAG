In the event of placing seals on the deeds and documents belonging to the accountants, the current year's ledgers and other accounting records are excepted from this.  It suffices to close these ledgers and have them signed by the judge, who then delivers them to the officer charged with keeping the accounts temporarily. This officer then becomes the guarantor and trustee of them before the courts; this shall be specified in the record of the placing of the seals.
