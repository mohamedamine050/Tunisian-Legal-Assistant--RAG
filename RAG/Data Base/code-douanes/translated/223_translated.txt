   - Exporting them.

   - Or placing them under a suspensive system or an economic system for the purpose of subsequent re-export.

By way of exception to the provisions of the first paragraph of this chapter, the Director General of Customs may, based on a justified request from the beneficiary of the system and after obtaining the opinion of the technical services of the ministry responsible for the licensed sector, exceptionally authorize the placing of compensatory products or the imported inputs in their current state for consumption.


3. Subject to the provisions of Chapter 224, when compensatory products are placed for consumption or when imported inputs are placed in their current state for consumption, the applicable duties and charges are calculated based on the tax elements of the imported goods as at the date of registration of the declaration relating to the placing of the goods under the effective processing system, plus the arrears surcharge provided for in Chapter 130, paragraph 3 of this Code, if these duties and charges were not secured upon importation.


4. When the imported goods, at the date of their placement for consumption, meet the conditions for benefiting from a differential tariff treatment granted to similar goods, these goods shall benefit from the same differential tariff treatment.


5. The imported goods referred to in paragraph (4) of this chapter shall be accepted with full or partial exemption from payment of the duties and charges due upon importation when they meet the conditions for benefiting from one of the exemption systems provided for in the legislation currently in force.
