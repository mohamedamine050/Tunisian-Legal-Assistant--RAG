If the unloading of the seized goods from the ships and warehouses with surfaces is impossible immediately, then the officers who effected the seizure shall place seals on the entrances and exits and a seizure record shall be drawn up concurrently with the unloading.  The number, marks, and numbers of the packages, boxes, barrels, and other means of packaging shall be specified, and their description shall be accurately recorded by the customs office in the presence of the suspect.  Suspicion (shubah) refers to the presumption of committing a crime before charges are filed or after the suspect is summoned to appear and is given a copy of each record if requested.
