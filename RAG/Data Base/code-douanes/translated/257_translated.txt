1- Goods for compensation intended for consumption are exempted from payment of duties and charges levied upon importation if it is sufficiently established to the Customs authority, through all supporting documents:

- That the exchange in kind occurred free of charge, either due to a contractual or legal obligation requiring a guarantee, or as a result of a defect in the manufacture of the goods.

- And that the tax liability has not been discharged in respect of domestic duties due to the export of the goods to be replaced in kind.

2-  The exchange in kind must be carried out, as the case may be, within the time limits specified in the first paragraph of Article 255 for the case of prior importation, or the time limits stipulated in paragraph 2 of Article 253 for used compensation goods.  In other cases, the time limits are those specified in the license granting the system of exchange in kind.

3- The first paragraph of this Article shall not apply if the defect affecting the exported goods is considered at the time they were initially placed for consumption and before they were placed under the system of exchange in kind.

4- The total exemption mentioned in the first paragraph of this Article is granted on condition that the compensation goods are imported within the time limits specified in the sales contract containing the guarantee clause.
