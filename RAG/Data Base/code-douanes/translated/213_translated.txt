The customs authorities may authorize fragmented manufacturing within the framework of processing between several institutions, each operating under one of the processing systems, provided that the final destination of the goods is export.

The Director General of Customs may exceptionally authorize fragmented manufacturing in other cases where the goods subject to processing are intended for consumption; the authorization shall specify the methods for carrying out these operations.
