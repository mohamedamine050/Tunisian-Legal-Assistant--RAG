1. The barter system, according to the conditions specified in this section of this Code, permits the final export of goods requiring repair, including their restoration to their original condition or modification, and the import of other compensatory goods exempt, wholly or partially, from the payment of duties and taxes payable upon import.  The exported goods shall be called "export goods," while the imported goods shall be called "compensatory goods."

2. In urgent cases and for substantiated economic reasons, the import of compensatory goods may precede the export of export goods; this case is called "advance import."  Advance import of compensatory goods entails the provision of a guarantee covering the amount of duties and taxes payable upon import.
