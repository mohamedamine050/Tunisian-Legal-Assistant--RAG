In the event that seizure occurs at residential premises, the unseized goods shall not be removed if the suspect provides a guarantee covering their value.  If the suspect does not provide a guarantee, or if the matter concerns seized goods, then they shall be transferred to the nearest customs office or entrusted to another person appointed as a custodian, either at the place of seizure or elsewhere.
