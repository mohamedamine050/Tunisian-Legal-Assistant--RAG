1- Qualified persons may be authorized to conduct detailed declarations in examining goods before declaring them and taking samples thereof, in the event that they lack the necessary elements to prepare these declarations.  They must then submit a request for this purpose, a "Request for Sampling and/or Examination of Imported Goods,"  but this request does not exempt them from the obligation to prepare the detailed declaration.

2- Any operation that alters the presentation of the goods that were the subject of the request referred to in the first paragraph of this chapter is prohibited.

3- The form of the "Request for Sampling and/or Examination of Imported Goods" and the methods of preliminary examination of goods shall be determined by a decision of the Minister of Finance.
