1. Goods must be accompanied, when transported under customs control or placed under a suspensive system or an economic customs system, by a bond exemption document. 2. The bond exemption document includes, in addition to a detailed declaration of the goods, the submission of an acceptable and sufficient bond. If the goods are not seized, the bond guarantee may be replaced by insurance of duties and taxes.  A bond is a contract in the form of a fair deed between the guarantor, who must be of sound mind, trustworthy, and capable of managing the affairs of the guaranteed party, who must be a minor child, and the parents of the guaranteed party or one of them if the other is deceased, unknown, incapacitated, or generally unknown to the court or the public guardian, as the case may be.  The contract includes the guarantor's undertaking to guarantee the child's treatment and payments.
