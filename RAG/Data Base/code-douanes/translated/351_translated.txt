Customs duties and charges, as well as fines and confiscations stipulated in this Code, and amounts that the Customs Administration has the right to recover, benefit from the special Treasury privilege stipulated in Article 34 of the Public Accounting Code on movable property belonging to debtors, which was used as security for the aforementioned duties, charges, or debts, and on their produce and income.  If the exercise of the special privilege referred to in the first paragraph above is impossible, these debts shall benefit from the general Treasury privilege referred to in Article 33 of the Public Accounting Code on all movable and immovable property belonging to the debtors. The exercise of this privilege shall not prevent the recovery of goods that are still in their original packaging and legally claimed by their owners.
