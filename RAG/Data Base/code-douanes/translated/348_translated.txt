Subject to the provisions of Article 304 of this Code, the owners of seized or confiscated property cannot claim its return, nor can creditors, even privileged creditors, claim the price of those things, whether that price is what the contracting parties agreed upon, or whether it exceeds or falls short of the sale price, insured or not. However, these owners and creditors may have recourse against the perpetrators of the offenses and misdemeanors, as appropriate.
