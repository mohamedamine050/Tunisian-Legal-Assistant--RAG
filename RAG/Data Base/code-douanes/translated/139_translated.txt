The utilization of any suspensive or economic customs system requires obtaining a license from the customs authorities.  The suspensive or economic customs system is granted when the customs authorities can identify the goods covered by this system upon their re-importation, re-exportation, release for consumption, or placement under any other suspensive or economic customs system, whether in their original state or as processed products.
