1.  A temporary admission permit is granted by Customs authorities upon application by the person using or commissioning the use of said goods.

2. Customs authorities shall refuse to grant a temporary admission regime when the imported goods cannot be identified for the purpose of monitoring.  However, they may authorize the use of a temporary admission regime without the possibility of identifying these goods for monitoring purposes when, considering the nature of the goods or the operations to be carried out, it is apparent that the lack of identification will not lead to misuse of the system.
