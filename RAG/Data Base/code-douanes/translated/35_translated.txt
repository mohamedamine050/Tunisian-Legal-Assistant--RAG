Customs authorities may, if they have reasons to doubt the veracity or accuracy of the information or documents relating to the contractual value, request the supplier or its representative to provide additional supporting evidence to prove the accuracy of the declared value.  If the reasons for doubting the truth or accuracy of the information or documents relating to the declared value remain, despite the provision of additional supporting evidence by the supplier or in the event of its non-provision, the Customs authorities may consider the contractual value unacceptable.  In the event of a decision on the matter, Customs authorities must justify their decision and notify the supplier in writing within a reasonable timeframe.
