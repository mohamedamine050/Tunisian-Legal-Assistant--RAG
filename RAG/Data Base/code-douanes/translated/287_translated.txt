1- In all cases, transported goods must be accompanied by the necessary and valid waybills and delivery receipts for the route taken by the goods and for the duration of the transport.  The subsequent presentation of these documents does not invalidate the offense.

2- Non-conformity between the type, quality, weight, number, or measure of the goods specified in the waybills and the type, weight, quality, number, or measure of the goods transported renders the waybill unacceptable and constitutes grounds for the seizure of all goods being transported. Waybills are also considered unacceptable after the expiry of the period specified therein.

3- Goods found outside the route indicated in the waybills are considered to be in illegal transit and are therefore liable to seizure.
