Customs officers may inspect installations and equipment erected on the continental shelf or in the exclusive economic zone at any time. They may also inspect means of transport used in the exploration or exploitation of natural resources contained within the continental shelf and the exclusive economic zone, within a surrounding safety zone as stipulated by current legislation, as well as within the maritime area of the customs territory.  This constitutes a legal inspection of property by the authorities for investigative purposes.
