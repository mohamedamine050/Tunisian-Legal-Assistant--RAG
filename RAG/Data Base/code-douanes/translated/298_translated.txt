1. Upon the export of goods or their placement in a customs warehouse for later export, customs duties and similar charges, if any, levied upon the supply of these goods or the raw materials used in their manufacture may be refunded.

2. Customs authorities may refuse to refund customs duties if the export operation is not commercially or economically justified.

3. The refund of customs duties and similar charges, and their definition, is effected by a preliminary decision of the Director General of Customs prior to the export of the goods. This decision specifies the refund rate, which may be estimated.  However, in urgent cases, the aforementioned preliminary decision for the refund of customs duties and the determination of their rate may precede the export, provided that samples of the goods intended for export are submitted, according to the same procedures provided for in Article 411 of this Code.

4. The refund of customs duties and similar charges is effected directly by the customs collector for the benefit of the depositor or the actual exporter of the goods, after verification that the goods have entered a customs-controlled warehouse or have actually exited the customs territory, as the case may be.

5.  Objections concerning the type, qualitative or quantitative composition of the exported products and goods benefiting from this system are referred to the central laboratory or the laboratory designated by the Minister of Finance.

6. The conditions and methods of applying the provisions of this Article shall be determined by an order.
