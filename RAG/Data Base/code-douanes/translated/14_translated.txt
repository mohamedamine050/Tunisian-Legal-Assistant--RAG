1. Imported or exported products are subject to the customs tariff in the state in which they are on the date this law comes into force.

2. However, the customs administration may authorize, within a single shipment, the sorting of goods damaged due to events that occurred before the detailed declaration was registered.  The damaged goods must then be destroyed, re-exported, or returned to the customs territory, as the case may be, or duties levied on them according to their new condition.

3. The applicable duties and charges are determined without regard to the relative value of the goods or their state of preservation.

4. Methods for destroying goods are regulated by order.
