Customs authorities may authorize fragmented manufacturing between several institutions, each operating under an effective processing system, or between them and other institutions operating under one of the processing systems, under customs supervision, provided that the goods are exclusively destined for export.  The Director General of Customs may exceptionally authorize fragmented manufacturing in other cases necessitated by economic necessity. The authorization shall specify the conditions for carrying out these operations.
