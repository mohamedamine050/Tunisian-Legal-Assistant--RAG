1- A. If the imported goods, or identical or similar goods, are sold in Tunisia in the condition they were in upon importation, then the customs value, in accordance with the provisions of this section, shall be based on the unit price at which the imported goods, or identical or similar imported goods, were sold in the largest aggregate quantity to unrelated persons at or about the same time as the importation of the goods to be assessed.  The following elements shall be deducted:

- Commissions usually or contractually paid, or profit margins and general expenses usually applied, including direct or indirect marketing costs related to the sale of imported goods of the same nature or type in Tunisia.

- Usual transport and insurance costs, and any related expenses incurred in Tunisia.

- The costs and expenses referred to in Article 30, paragraph 1(c) of this Code, where applicable.

- Customs duties and other charges levied in Tunisia upon importation or sale of the goods.


B. If the imported goods, or identical or similar goods, are not sold at or about the same time as the importation of the goods to be assessed, then the customs value of the imported goods shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of this section, taking into account the provisions of paragraph 1(A), by reference to the unit price at which the imported goods were sold on the domestic market in the same condition at a time following the date of importation of the goods to be assessed, not exceeding ninety days from that date.


2. If the imported goods, or identical or similar goods, are not sold on the domestic market in the condition they were in upon importation, then the determination of the customs value, if requested by the importer, shall be based on the unit price at which the imported goods are sold in Tunisia after manufacture or processing in the largest aggregate quantity to unrelated persons, taking into account the added value resulting from the manufacture or processing, and also the deductions provided for in paragraph 1(A) of this section.
