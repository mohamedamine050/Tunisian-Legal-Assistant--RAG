The claim is extinguished.

[1] A claim is a request by one party to another for the recognition of a right in the presence of a judge; the requestor is called the claimant, and the party from whom the request is made is called the defendant. [2]  A claim is the right of any party to bring a matter before the court for a judgment on its merits.  For the defendant, it is the right to present grounds for defense or arguments aimed at refuting that claim.

The general rule is that claims in administrative misdemeanors and felonies are extinguished by the lapse of three years, under the same conditions stipulated in the Code of Criminal Procedure.
