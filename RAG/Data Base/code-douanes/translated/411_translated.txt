1. In the case referred to in Article 122, paragraph (1) of this Code, the customs authorities shall prepare a testing mandate and collect the necessary samples for the testing process.  The methods of sample collection, as well as the cases in which these samples may be replaced by certain documents by decision of the Minister of Finance, shall be regulated.

If the customs authoritiesâ€™ examinations reveal that the goods in question are of a prohibited type, then, unless public order dictates otherwise, the release thereof may be offered or requested in return for providing a financial guarantee or security of a sum that may reach the value of the goods concerned, as assessed by the customs authorities.

3. The request for testing, the offer or request for release, and the response of the declarant shall be recorded.

4. The provisions of Article 348 of this Code shall apply, until the final resolution of the dispute, to the seized goods or to the guarantors and the secured sums of money in the event of their release.
