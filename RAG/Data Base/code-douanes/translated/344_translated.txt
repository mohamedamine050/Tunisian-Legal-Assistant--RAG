1. If the court finds mitigating circumstances, it may decide to:

a) Exempt the offenders from the confiscation of vehicles, except in cases where smuggling or similar acts involved concealing goods from customs authorities using specially adapted hiding places, pockets, or hollow spaces not normally used for shipping goods.

b) Exempt the offenders from the confiscation of other items contained in the vehicle used to conceal the fraud.

c) Reduce the amounts replacing the confiscation of goods to no less than one-third of the value of these goods, taking into account the provisions of Article 407 of this Code.

d) Reduce the financial penalties to no less than one-third of the minimum amount, taking into account the provisions of Article 407 of this Code.

e) Cancel or limit the joint and several liability for some of the convicted persons with regard to the financial penalties stipulated in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this Article.

If the court finds mitigating circumstances only for some of the suspected partners, it shall first rule on the financial penalties against the convicted persons not benefiting from mitigating circumstances on a joint and several liability basis.  Thereafter, the court may, with regard to the amounts replacing confiscation and financial penalties, limit the joint and several liability for the persons benefiting from mitigating circumstances.

If the court finds mitigating circumstances for a suspected person, it may exempt them from the prison sentence stipulated in this Code, or it may decide to postpone its execution.


2. If the seized goods are not specifically prohibited by customs legislation, the court may authorize their release before the final judgment, provided that a guarantor is provided or a sum equivalent to their value is deposited.


3. The court may not exempt those liable for payment from paying the amounts obtained fraudulently or without legal basis, nor may it exempt them from the confiscation of goods that pose a risk to health or public morals and order, counterfeit goods, or goods subject to customs seizures.
