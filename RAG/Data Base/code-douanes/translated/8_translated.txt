If a vessel flying the Tunisian flag is subject in a foreign country to the payment of duties or other costs, whatever their nature, and the vessels of the said country are exempt therefrom or subject to treatment less favorable than that accorded to vessels of other countries, then, by virtue of an order, the necessary duties may be levied on the vessels of the said countries and on their cargoes, to avoid the harm suffered by the vessel flying the Tunisian flag.
