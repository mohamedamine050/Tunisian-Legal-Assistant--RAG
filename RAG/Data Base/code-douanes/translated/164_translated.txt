1. Customs authorities may authorize the transport of goods under the coastal sea transport system by a vessel carrying other goods at the same time, provided that the goods under the coastal sea transport system can be identified and the other requirements of the customs authorities are met.

2. Customs authorities may, for the purpose of tighter control, require the separation of Tunisian goods or goods that have been Tunisianized, transported under the coastal sea transport system, from other goods on board the vessel.

3. Goods placed under the coastal sea transport system are transported under exemption documents with a guarantee.  The exemption document may be replaced by a guarantee with a transit document if the goods are Tunisian or Tunisianized, not subject to duties and taxes upon export, and not seized upon exit.

4. In the event of interruption of transport under the coastal sea transport system due to an accident or force majeure, the vessel's master or any other person concerned must take all necessary measures to prevent the goods from circulating under unauthorized conditions, and inform the customs authorities or other competent authorities of the nature of the accident and the other circumstances that led to the interruption of transport.
