**Regardless of the penalties stipulated in Article 35, the court is required to order the seizure of the subject matter of the crime, whether movable or immovable property, whether the crime constitutes a prohibited transaction or a failure to declare, deposit, or refer to the Central Bank of Tunisia.**

**In the event that the seizure of the subject matter of the crime is not feasible or is not provided by the perpetrator, the court shall, instead of ordering the seizure, impose a financial penalty equal to the value of the subject matter of the crime, plus the illicit profits realized or intended to be realized by the perpetrators of the crime.**

**If the crime involves the participation of multiple parties, the subject matter of the crime, whether provided or not, shall consist of the sum of the services provided by each party, including any payments made for the services.**
