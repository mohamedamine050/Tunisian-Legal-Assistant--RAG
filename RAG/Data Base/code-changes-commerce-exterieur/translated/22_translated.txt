Crimes or attempts to commit crimes against foreign exchange regulations shall be investigated, prosecuted, and punished in accordance with the conditions set forth in this law. 

The public action in relation to such crimes shall be extinguished after three years.

This applies to the following offenses: retaining gains or revenues of any kind without declaring them or repatriating them to Tunisia, as specified in this law or the texts applicable thereto. This also applies to the non-performance, partial non-performance, or delay in the performance of any obligations or commitments undertaken by the institution toward third parties in exchange for receiving goods, services, or loans from them, and for which commitments were made to the Central Bank of Tunisia in exchange for certain authorizations granted by the bank.
