When an expert physician is entrusted with a task, he must refuse it if he finds that the questions posed to him are not related to pure medical techniques or are not within his scope of expertise. When drafting his report, the expert physician must only disclose those elements that will provide answers to the questions posed to him in his assignment mandate. The expert physician must not disclose outside this scope anything that has come to his knowledge in connection with the performance of this task.
