The physician must always prepare a list of his fees personally, carefully, and moderately, taking into account the following:

- The definitions and fees as required by the current legislative and regulatory provisions, which serve as a basis for setting medical expenses recovered by social security bodies.

- The amount of fees as determined and reviewed periodically by the National Council of the Order of Physicians and professional bodies, as well as special circumstances, such as the patient's condition, the complexity of the work, and its difficulty. 

The physician is not entitled to refuse his patient's request for information regarding his fee list.
