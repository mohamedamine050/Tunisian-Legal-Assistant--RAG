Every physician establishing his practice for the first time shall submit to the Regional Council of the Order the text of the announcement to be published in the press in plain characters to inform the public of the opening of his clinic. These announcements may be published in different newspapers on the same day for a period of three consecutive days only. In case of the physician's absence for a period of not less than 15 days, he may, after informing the Regional Council of the Order of his absence, notify his colleagues through the press in a single publication. Any change of address shall be announced through the press once and under the same conditions.
