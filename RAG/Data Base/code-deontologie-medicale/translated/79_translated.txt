**Occupational Medicine**

Occupational medicine services, whether private or in the form of associations, primarily play a preventive role in the field of occupational health. They are specifically tasked with examining and monitoring the health and physical fitness of workers to perform the required duties, both at the time of recruitment and during employment. They are also responsible for protecting them from hazards that may threaten their health due to their profession, in accordance with the current legislation.
