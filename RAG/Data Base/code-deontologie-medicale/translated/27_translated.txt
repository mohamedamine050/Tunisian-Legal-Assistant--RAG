The practice of medicine typically involves the physician assuming responsibility for, and conducting, medical examinations within their capabilities.  This includes issuing certificates, prescriptions, statements, or documents as required by legal or regulatory provisions.  The aforementioned documents issued by a physician must include their identity, handwritten signature, and the date of the examination as verified in the data contained in the documents, along with the date of their issuance. These documents must also include the correct identification of the patient.
