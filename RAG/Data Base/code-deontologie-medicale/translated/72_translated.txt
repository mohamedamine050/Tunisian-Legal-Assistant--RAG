No person may simultaneously act as an expert medical witness and a treating physician for the same patient. A physician shall not accept an examination task if they become aware of any factor that could affect their ability to perform it impartially, particularly if the matter concerns the interests of a friend, close family member, colleague, or a group that benefits from their services. The same applies if the matter concerns their own personal interests. They must exercise objectivity in their conclusions and act with complete independence.
