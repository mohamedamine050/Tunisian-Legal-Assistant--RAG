During treatment, the physician must have the freedom to resort to a new therapeutic method if he deems it to hold genuine hope for saving the patient's life, restoring his health, or alleviating his pain. He should, as far as possible, taking into account the patient's mental state, obtain the patient's free and informed consent. If the patient lacks legal capacity, the consent of the legal representative shall stand in place of the patient's consent.
