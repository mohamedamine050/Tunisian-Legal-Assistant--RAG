Physicians are obligated to cultivate amicable collegial relationships and to extend moral support to one another. If a physician finds themselves embroiled in a professional dispute with a colleague, they must first endeavor to reconcile with them. Should reconciliation prove impossible, they may inform the President of the Regional Council of the Medical Syndicate. Slandering a colleague, defaming them, or disseminating information that could undermine their professional practice is strictly prohibited. A hallmark of good collegial conduct is to defend a colleague who is unjustly subjected to slander.
