Freelance practitioners provide their services exclusively at their clinics, except for examining patients at their homes in emergency cases and occupational medicine activities. 

Occupational medicine services, whether private or in the form of associations, primarily play a preventive role in the field of occupational health. They are specifically tasked with examining and monitoring the health and physical fitness of workers to perform the required duties, both upon recruitment and during employment. This also includes protecting them from risks that may affect their health due to their profession. 

This includes school and university medicine, surveillance and testing medicine.
