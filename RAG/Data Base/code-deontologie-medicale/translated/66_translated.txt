Except in emergency situations and taking into account legislative or regulatory provisions relating to the medical, social, occupational or school and university health interests, no physician responsible for preventive medical care for a group shall provide treatment to that group. In all cases, he must refer the person who has been diagnosed with a disease to his attending physician. If the patient does not have an attending physician, the physician must leave him with complete freedom of choice.
