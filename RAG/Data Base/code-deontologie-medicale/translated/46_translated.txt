The division of fees relating to the examination or treatment between the attending physician, on the one hand, and the consulting or specialized physician, on the other hand, is prohibited. Each physician must submit their own fee schedule. In no circumstances can the specialist or consultant accept the delivery of fees to the attending physician, but must declare that these fees are separate from their own fee schedule. Accepting, requesting, or proposing a division of fees, even if it remains without effect, is considered a serious professional error.
