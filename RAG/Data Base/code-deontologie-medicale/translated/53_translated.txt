The physician treating a patient must propose a consultation when circumstances require it. He must accept the consultation requested by the patient or those living with him. In both cases, the treating physician proposes the consultant he deems most competent, but he must consider the patient's wishes and, in principle, accept to meet with any physician registered with the Board of Medical Examiners for consultation, subject to the regulations governing consultations. If the treating physician believes he should not endorse the proposed examination, he may withdraw, subject to the conditions stipulated in Articles 38 and 39 of this Code.
