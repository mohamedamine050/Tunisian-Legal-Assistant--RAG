As a general rule, and at the end of each consultation, a consultation is an act of seeking advice and opinion, undertaken by two or more physicians. Their conclusions are documented in writing jointly, signed by the attending physician and endorsed by the consulting physician(s). When written conclusions are not prepared, it is deemed that the consulting physician fully agrees with the opinion of the attending physician.
