A surgical physician has the right to choose his assistant or assistants for the operation. These assistants can directly claim their fees from the patient, failing which, such fees shall be included in the invoice submitted by the surgeon to the patient. However, where the surgeon deems it necessary to assign the role of assistant to the attending physician, the latter shall claim his fees directly from the patient.
