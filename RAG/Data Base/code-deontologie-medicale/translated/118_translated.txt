In the event that the practice of medicine by a physician registered on the roll of the Medical Council becomes impossible or dangerous, the Minister of Health shall, upon receiving written notification of this matter, refer it to the National Council of the Medical Council, which shall decide on the matter after obtaining a reasoned opinion from four expert physicians, two of whom shall be appointed by the National Council of the Medical Council and the other two by the physician concerned by the case. If the latter does not appoint two expert physicians, the Medical Council shall be obliged to appoint them within eight days after notifying the concerned party without any result. The Medical Council may also take up the matter on its own initiative at the request of any physician. In all cases, the Council must decide within two months from the date of its taking up the matter. However, in urgent cases, the Minister of Health may suspend the physician concerned by the case from practice until the Medical Council decides on his status. The National Council must be immediately informed of the suspension.
