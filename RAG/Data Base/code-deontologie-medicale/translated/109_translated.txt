In accordance with the general rule, consent must be in writing.  The responsibility of informing a subject of a trial always rests on the person conducting it.  This responsibility encompasses the obligation to respond to the subject's actions before the law or to compensate for any damage caused by the trial.  However, this responsibility does not apply at all to a person who willingly submits to the trial.
