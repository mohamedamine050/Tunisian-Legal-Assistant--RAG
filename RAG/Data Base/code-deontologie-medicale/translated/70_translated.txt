The supervising physician shall refrain from intervening in the treatment and shall limit his role to examining the patient and providing his opinion regarding the justifiable reason for the patient's absence from work. However, if he disagrees with his colleague during the examination regarding the diagnosis of the disease or its symptoms, or if he observes an important and useful element for the course of treatment that his colleague has overlooked, he shall point it out to him personally. If there is an issue in this regard, he may notify the Regional Council of the Medical Profession thereof, in order to attempt to reconcile the views of the two physicians while taking into account the best interests of the patient.
