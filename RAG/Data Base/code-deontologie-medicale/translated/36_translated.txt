After a period of at least three years following the issuance of a final decision regarding the removal from the registry, a doctor or dentist subject to this punishment may request the lifting of the suspension resulting from the punishment. This request shall be submitted to the Council of Discipline, by way of a petition addressed to the President of the National Council of the relevant professional association. If the request is rejected after consideration on its merits, it may not be resubmitted until after a period of at least one year.

If the removal from the registry was the result of a penalty imposed by a court, the request for lifting the punishment may only be accepted if the criminal penalty is revoked through the restoration of rights, review, or legislative pardon. In this case, no time limit is required for submitting the initial request to lift the punishment. However, if the request is rejected on its merits, subsequent requests shall be subject to a period of one year.
