A physician may accept at his clinic all patients, whether they have a primary care physician or not.  If a physician accepts at his clinic a patient who has been referred to him without the knowledge of the patient's primary care physician, the physician must attempt, with the patient's consent, to contact his colleague in order to exchange information, share their observations and conclusions.
