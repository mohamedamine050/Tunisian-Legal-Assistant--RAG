The Order of Merit shall remain the property of its recipient for their lifetime.

The Order of Merit may only be revoked from its recipient if the latter is subjected to a custodial sentence for the commission of a crime or misdemeanor.  The courts shall, to this end, submit to the Secretary of State for Youth, Sports, and Social Affairs a list of the names of those convicted who are recipients of the Order of Merit.

The Secretary of State for Youth, Sports, and Social Affairs shall undertake the task of this revocation and the deletion of names from the list of recipients.
