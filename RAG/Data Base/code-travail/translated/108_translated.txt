The absences occurring under the circumstances described in the preceding article cannot be a reason for reducing the salaries and wages paid monthly, bi-monthly, or weekly.  Workers whose remuneration is calculated by the hour, day, share, specific task, or output are entitled to a grant equal to the wages they missed due to the aforementioned absences. This grant, which is borne by the employer, is calculated based on working hours and the distribution of the weekly working hours normally practiced in the establishment.
