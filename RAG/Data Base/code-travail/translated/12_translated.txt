The employee shall not be held liable for damage or loss resulting from a fortuitous event or force majeure, except in the case of a requirement to return the items received.  Damage to the item resulting from defects therein or from the fragility of its material is considered similar to damage arising from a fortuitous event, unless it is the result of the employee's fault.
