The employee whose employment contract—a legally binding agreement that obligates the contracting parties and defines their respective rights and obligations concerning the specific transaction—was terminated before enjoying the full entitlement to his leave, shall receive, in compensation for the unused portion of his leave, a grant determined according to the provisions of the preceding chapter.  This grant shall not be due if the termination of the employment contract—a legally binding agreement that obligates the contracting parties and defines their respective rights and obligations concerning the specific transaction—was due to a serious fault committed by the employee.

In the event of termination of an employment contract—a legally binding agreement that obligates the contracting parties and defines their respective rights and obligations concerning the specific transaction—where an employee, due to the specific system for leave entitlement, enjoyed leave for which the granted amount exceeded the amount he could have claimed at the time of termination considering his length of service, then this employee must reimburse the employer for the excess received.  Reimbursement shall not be required if the termination of the employment contract—a legally binding agreement that obligates the contracting parties and defines their respective rights and obligations concerning the specific transaction—was due to a serious fault committed by the employer.

However, the preceding provisions shall not apply if the employer is required to enroll in the National Social Security Fund pursuant to Chapter 121. In this case, upon termination of an employment contract—a legally binding agreement that obligates the contracting parties and defines their respective rights and obligations concerning the specific transaction—regardless of the circumstances surrounding the termination, the employer shall provide the employee with a certificate attesting to his leave entitlement, taking into account his length of service.

Claims for the grants provided for in Chapter 119 and this Chapter shall lapse after one year.
