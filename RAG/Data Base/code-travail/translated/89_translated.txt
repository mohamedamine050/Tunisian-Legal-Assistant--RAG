The workday in all institutions, regardless of type, must include a rest period or periods totaling at least one hour during which work is suspended.  These rest periods must be arranged in a manner that prevents an employee from working for more than six consecutive hours without a break of at least half an hour. However, if the actual working time does not exceed seven hours in the same day, work may be performed without interruption.  Each person's daily work must be followed by an uninterrupted rest period of not less than ten hours, without prejudice to the special provisions relating to women and children. In the case of work organized according to rotating centers or teams, the work of each team must be continuous, provided that the regulations stipulated in the preceding paragraphs are observed.
