Hours lost due to a joint interruption of work at an establishment or part thereof may be recovered within the two months following the work interruption.  The hours thus recovered shall be paid at the usual rate. The head of the establishment shall inform the labor inspectorate beforehand of the joint interruption of work and the method of recovery; however, if the work interruption occurs due to an unforeseen incident, notification shall be given immediately. Hours lost due to a workers' strike or a professional strike cannot be recovered unless both parties agree to do so.
