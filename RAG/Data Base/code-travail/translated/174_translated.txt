Inspectors tasked with work inspection, holding a document attesting to their position, are authorized to:

1. Enter any establishment subject to inspection oversight freely and without prior notice at any hour of the day or night.

2. Enter during the day any premises which they have reasonable grounds to believe are subject to inspection oversight.

3. Enter premises where workers at their homes perform work entrusted to them by establishment owners.

However, when work is carried out in residential premises, inspectors tasked with work inspection may not enter these premises except after receiving permission from their occupants.

4. Conduct any inspection, supervision, or investigation they deem necessary to verify that legal or regulatory provisions have been effectively observed, specifically:

a. Questioning the employer or establishment workers, individually or in the presence of witnesses, on all matters related to the application of legal, regulatory, or contractual provisions.  Workers' answers shall not be considered as disclosure of professional secrets.

b. Requesting access to all registers, books, and documents required to be kept or retained under labor legislation, in order to verify their compliance with legal or regulatory provisions and to take copies or summaries thereof.  To conduct general or specific investigations they may be entrusted with, they shall have the legal capacity to demand the submission of all documents proving the declarations made by employers, particularly those relating to finances and those affecting the management of establishments and investments.

Employees of various public administrations and institutions are not bound by professional secrecy vis-Ã -vis work inspection officers when they are performing their duties and for any information required by this task.

c. Requesting the posting of notices stipulated by legal or regulatory provisions.

d. Taking samples of materials used or handled for analysis, provided that the employer or their representative is aware that the inspectors have taken materials for this purpose.  These samples may be taken from gases, vapors, and all other materials present in the workplace atmosphere.  To examine violations and hazards caused by materials to worker health, samples must be taken as if it were a matter of suppressing fraud.

e. Observing strikes or work stoppages.

Upon conducting an inspection visit, the inspector must inform the employer or their representative of their arrival, unless they believe that such notification would compromise the effectiveness of the inspection.

Work inspection officers, in their capacity as judicial police officers, may seek the assistance of public force in carrying out their duties whenever they deem it necessary.
