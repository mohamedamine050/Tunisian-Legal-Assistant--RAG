An employee who was compelled to leave his employment due to his recruitment—in any manner whatsoever—has the right to request reinstatement to his former job or to a job of the same professional category with the same employer.  The employee who learns of his release from military service and wishes to return to the job he held upon joining the army must inform his former employer by registered letter within one month of that release. The employee who has expressed his intention to return to his work, as indicated in the preceding paragraph, shall be reinstated to his position unless the previous job or a similar job has been eliminated. Reinstatement, where possible, shall be within the month following the receipt of the registered letter expressing the employee's desire to return to his work. The employee shall enjoy all the benefits he had obtained before leaving his employment. Every employee who has not been employed has a right of priority of employment for one year from the date of release from military service. The employee has the right to claim damages in case of breach of the provisions of the preceding paragraphs by the employer. Any clause contrary to the aforementioned provisions shall be legally null and void.
