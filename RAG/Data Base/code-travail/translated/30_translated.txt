If a subcontractor performs services in factories, warehouses, or yards not belonging to the original contractor who entrusted him with the services, he must post a notice in each of the aforementioned factories, warehouses, or yards stating the name and address of the person who entrusted him with the services.  Regardless of the location where the services are performed, subcontractors are required to specify on the payment slips they issue to their workers—in addition to their names and addresses—the names of the person or persons who entrusted them with the performance of the service for which the aforementioned workers were hired.
