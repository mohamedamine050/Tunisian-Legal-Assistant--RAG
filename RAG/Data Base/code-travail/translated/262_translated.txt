No lessor may engage a foreign worker before the expiration of the contract of employment with a previous lessor.

A contract is a legally binding agreement that obligates the contracting parties and defines their obligations and rights concerning the specific transaction.

Regardless of the penalties incurred for violations, crimes punishable by death or imprisonment exceeding five years are classified as felonies under this law.  Crimes punishable by imprisonment exceeding fifteen days but not exceeding five years, or by a fine exceeding sixty dinars, are classified as misdemeanors.  Crimes punishable by imprisonment not exceeding fifteen days or a fine not exceeding sixty dinars are classified as infractions. (Article 122, Code of Criminal Procedure)

This prohibition may be subject to claims for damages. [1] Harm inflicted in violation of the law affecting a person's body, mental or psychological health, reputation, property, or standing. [2] Loss or damage to property, deprivation of comfort, or damage to physical well-being, reputation, or the like.  In crimes and quasi-crimes, damage is the actual loss suffered by the claimant, the necessary expenses incurred or to be incurred to repair the consequences of the act that caused the damage, and any benefit lost within the normal limits of the consequences of this act resulting from this violation.

However, the foreign worker may enter into a new contract after providing proof that his previous contract was terminated by mutual agreement or by court order.

The lessor must inform the ministry responsible for employment of the departure of each foreign worker employed in his establishment.
