Employees whose employment contracts were terminated due to the elimination of their positions for economic reasons have the right of priority in re-employment according to the terms of their employment contracts at the time of their dismissal, provided the institution hires an employee of the same professional category. This right is valid for one year from the date of dismissal.  To exercise this right, the procedures stipulated in Article 8 of this Code must be observed. Re-employment of dismissed employees shall be based on their seniority within the institution, increased by one year for each child under sixteen years of age at the time of dismissal. The employer must notify the territorially competent labor inspectorate in writing of their desire to re-employ employees. The employee's request for re-employment within the specified period may be proven by all means, particularly by producing a receipt proving the sending of a registered letter.
