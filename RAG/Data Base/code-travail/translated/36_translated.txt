Persons bound by a joint work agreement may bring an action for damages against other persons or entities bound by the agreement who may have breached the contractual obligations owed to them.  Damage [1] means harm inflicted in violation of the law affecting a person's body, mental or psychological health, reputation, property, or honor; [2] loss or damage to property, deprivation of comfort, or impairment of physical well-being, reputation, or the like.  In crimes and quasi-crimes, damage is the actual loss suffered by the claimant and the necessary expenses that he has been or will be compelled to incur to repair the consequences of the act committed to his detriment, as well as what he has been deprived of within the ordinary limits of the consequences of that act.
