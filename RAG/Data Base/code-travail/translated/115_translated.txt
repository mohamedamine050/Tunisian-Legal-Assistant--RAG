The granted leave period, as mentioned, shall be increased by one working day for each full consecutive five-year period of service with the same employer, provided that this increase does not raise the leave period to more than eighteen working days, and without adding this increase to any increase resulting from the terms of collective agreements, individual employment contracts, or customs.

The period during which the execution of the employment contract is suspended, without its termination, particularly due to illness, work accidents, or unemployment, shall be considered equivalent to a period of actual work for the application of the provisions of the preceding paragraph.

The service qualifying for supplementary leave due to seniority shall be calculated either upon expiry of the standard leave entitlement period or upon termination of the contract if its termination requires the granting of a severance allowance in lieu of leave.

Subject to the conditions stipulated in the first paragraph above, the foregoing provisions shall not contravene the limitations of collective agreements or individual contracts, nor customs that provide for paid leave longer than that mentioned.
