The training contract must be established in writing; otherwise, it is void.

It must be drawn up within a maximum period of half a month from the date of its implementation and must be drawn up in triplicate: one copy for the lessor, another for the trainee or his legal representative, and the third for the competent authority of the Ministry of Youth, Sports and Social Affairs.

The lessor must submit the three copies to the competent authority of the Ministry of Youth, Sports and Social Affairs, which returns two copies prepared for both parties after endorsement.

The endorsement of the competent authority of the Ministry of Youth, Sports and Social Affairs establishes the date of the contract and gives it full legal effect.

The training contract is exempt from all stamp and registration duties.
