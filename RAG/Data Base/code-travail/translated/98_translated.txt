In the event of urgent work that must be carried out immediately to organize rescue measures, prevent imminent accidents, or repair a breakdown in the institution's machinery, equipment, or buildings, the weekly rest period may be suspended for the employees necessary to carry out such work.  This possibility of suspension applies not only to the employees of the institution where the urgent work is required, but also includes employees of other institutions working for its benefit. Each worker in these institutions shall be entitled to a compensatory rest period equal in duration to the rest period that was suspended. The permissions stipulated in this section do not apply to boys under the age of sixteen and girls under the age of twenty.
