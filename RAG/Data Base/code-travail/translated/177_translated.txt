Labor inspectors observe violations and draw up reports concerning them, which are considered valid unless evidence to the contrary is presented.  These reports are transmitted by the heads of the territorially competent labor inspectorates to the Public Prosecutor for prosecution. They are drawn up in accordance with the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
