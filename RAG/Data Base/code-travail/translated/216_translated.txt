The labor courts shall hear at first instance all claims falling within their jurisdiction, regardless of the amount claimed. However, they shall hear definitively claims relating to the delivery of documents that the employer is required to deliver to the employee in accordance with legal or contractual provisions.  The courts of general jurisdiction dealing with disputes pursuant to Article 185 of this Code shall apply the same rules set forth in this Article.
