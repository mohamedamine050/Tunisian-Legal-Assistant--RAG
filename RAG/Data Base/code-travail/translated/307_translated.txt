Any institution remaining inactive for two consecutive years without supporting documentation—where supporting documentation means a single isolated accounting entry or a summary justifying a set of transactions—sufficient to justify its activity is considered in a state of neglect and cannot appeal its inactivity.  Appeal is a legal procedure allowing a chosen party to request a review of the judgment issued by the previous court. It may not resume its activity except after obtaining a new license according to the conditions stipulated in Article 296.
