The provisions of this law also apply to the following categories of workers:

1. Persons entrusted within an industrial or commercial establishment by the head of the establishment, or with his consent, to be at the disposal of clients throughout the clients' stay in the establishment's premises or its dependencies, to safeguard their money, clothing, and belongings, or to provide them with any services whatsoever.

2. Persons who professionally engage, either in selling goods or materials of any kind, securities, books, publications, and tickets of all types, which are entrusted to them on a continuous or quasi-continuous basis by a single industrial or commercial establishment; or in accepting goods or objects intended for processing, adaptation, or transport for the benefit of a single industrial or commercial establishment, if these persons carry out their work in a location belonging to the establishment or in a location authorized by the head of the establishment, and apply the conditions and prices determined by him.

The head of the industrial or commercial establishment who supplies the goods, materials, securities, or tickets, or for whose benefit goods or objects intended for processing, adaptation, or transport are accepted, shall always be responsible towards the persons mentioned in the preceding paragraph for the application of the wage system.

He shall not be responsible for other procedures unless the working conditions, health and safety conditions are determined by him or with his consent. Otherwise, the aforementioned persons are considered as managers of the establishments, and the labor regulations shall not apply to them unless they apply to the heads, managers, or those entrusted with the establishments.

With regard to workers subordinate to the aforementioned persons, these latter shall not be held liable on behalf of the head of the industrial or commercial establishment with whom they have contracted for the application of labor laws towards the workers, unless they enjoy the freedom to hire and fire them and to determine their working conditions.
