Trade unions established in accordance with the provisions of this law may form federations in a manner similar to the methods of establishing the unions themselves and for the same purposes mentioned herein.  Articles 243 to 251 of this chapter shall apply to them.

These federations must submit a list of the unions they comprise, in addition to their statutes and a complete list of the names of the persons responsible for their administration and management.

Their statutes should specify the rules by which the member unions are represented on the administrative council and general assemblies of each of the federations.
