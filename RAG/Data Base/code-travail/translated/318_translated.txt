A general privilege in favor of the Public Treasury is exercised over the property, both real and personal, of the debtors mentioned, in accordance with the provisions of Articles 5 and 6 of the aforementioned order dated July 13, 1899.

Consequently, a purchaser of an establishment must verify the payment of dues levied against it up to the date of purchase.  If he fails to do so, he is permitted to deduct the balance of the dues from the purchase price, unless otherwise stipulated.

In any case, he becomes personally liable for the aforementioned balance and for the costs of pursuit. This ruling applies to those whose property is sold through judicial means.
