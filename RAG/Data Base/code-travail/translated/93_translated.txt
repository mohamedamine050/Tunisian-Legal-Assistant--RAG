Overtime work or making up for lost hours cannot result in the weekly working hours exceeding sixty hours, excluding continuous leave hours. This is except in the case of urgent work that must be carried out immediately to avoid imminent accidents or to organize rescue operations.  The possibility of making up for lost hours, as well as the possibility of performing overtime, can be suspended in case of unemployment in some industries after consultation with the trade unions concerned, either nationwide or in a region or several regions, pursuant to a decision by the Secretary of State for Youth, Sports, and Social Affairs, and, regarding certain establishments, pursuant to a decision by the Chief Labour Inspector.  Consultation is the act of consulting and seeking opinions.
