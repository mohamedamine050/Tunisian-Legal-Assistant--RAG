"Wages" means what the worker is entitled to from his employer in return for the work performed.

Wages include the basic wage, regardless of its calculation method, and its related allowances and benefits, whether monetary or in kind, regardless of their nature, fixed or variable, general or specific, except for allowances that are in the nature of expense reimbursements.

"Guaranteed minimum wage" means the minimum level below which the wage of a worker tasked with performing work that does not require professional qualifications cannot fall.
