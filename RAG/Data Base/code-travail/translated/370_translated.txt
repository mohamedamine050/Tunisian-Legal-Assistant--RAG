Each worker must be informed upon their assignment whether their employment will be permanent, seasonal, or temporary.

A permanent worker is one who is assigned for an unspecified period to participate in all operations related to a series of regular agricultural works on the farm, and to whom the lessor guarantees regular work.

During the trial period, as dictated by custom, which in no case can exceed thirty days, the employment contract may be terminated without prior notice.

After the trial period, the prior notice period for termination cannot be less than 8 full days, unless the worker commits a serious fault.

The employment contract shall not be invalidated by the temporary absence of the permanent worker from work due to illness, a work-related accident, inclement weather, or other unforeseen circumstances or force majeure, provided that this absence is less than three months. To benefit from this condition, the worker must inform their lessor within fifteen days of the reasons for their absence. After the third month of justified absence, the worker retains the right of priority of assignment for a new period of one year.

The provisions of paragraphs 3, 4, and 5 of this chapter do not apply to seasonal and temporary workers assigned to perform work of a variable but limited duration, necessitated by seasonal or temporary needs on the farm, and whose contract terminates upon completion of the work.
