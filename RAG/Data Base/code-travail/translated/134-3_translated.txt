A portion of wages may be determined on the basis of productivity pursuant to agreements concluded within the establishment between the employer and worker representatives.  These agreements shall include, in particular, the criteria adopted for improving performance and the procedures ensuring increased production and improved quality. However, wages may be entirely determined according to output, piecework, or task-based payment for work habitually contracted on such a basis. In no case shall the application of the foregoing provisions result in the payment of wages less than those stipulated in regulatory texts or collective sector agreements.
