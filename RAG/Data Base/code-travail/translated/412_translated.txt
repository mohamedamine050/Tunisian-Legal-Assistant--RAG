The employee is always entitled to remuneration, regardless of the reasons and date of separation from employment, even if this separation occurs upon the expiry of a fixed-term contract.  This includes the fee and any outstanding payments for authorizations not issued on the date of leaving the establishment, but directly related to samples and prices applicable before the contract's expiry.  The entitlement to the fee does not exceed the period customarily worked in each profession, unless otherwise stipulated.
