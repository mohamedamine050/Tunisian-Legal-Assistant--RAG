Users may only be employed according to data in a schedule specifying daily, weekly, or monthly work hour distribution, as appropriate. This distribution specifies the start and end times of working hours. Different working and rest hours may be approved for categories of workers subject to the permanent exceptions provided for in Article 82 and paragraph 3 of Article 83. Any amendment to the work hour distribution requires, prior to implementation, the amendment of the previously established distribution. This distribution, dated and signed by the head of the establishment or by a person authorized to act on their behalf, must be displayed prominently in legible characters in all workplaces to which it applies, or, for workers employed outside the establishment, at the location assigned to those workers. A copy of the work hour schedule and any amendments thereto must be submitted to the territorially competent Labour Inspectorate.
