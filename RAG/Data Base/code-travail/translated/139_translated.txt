Wages of all kinds must be paid in a currency that is legal tender in the Tunisian Republic, except where contrary legal or regulatory provisions exist.  However,  in rem privileges may be granted in accordance with regulatory or contractual provisions. In no case can these in rem privileges be deducted from the minimum wages paid in cash.
