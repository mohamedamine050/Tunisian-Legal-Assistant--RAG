The days of holidays during which work is suspended with payment of wages are determined by order or by joint agreements.  The allocation of these days cannot result in the suspension of the establishment's activity for a period exceeding 48 consecutive hours.  The methods of implementing these provisions are determined by a decision of the Minister responsible for Social Affairs, taken after consultation with the professional organizations of employers and workers.
