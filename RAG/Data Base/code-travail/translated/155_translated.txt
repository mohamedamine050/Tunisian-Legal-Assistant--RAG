Physicians are appointed to occupational health services from among physicians specializing in occupational health, unless this proves impossible.  The appointment is submitted for approval to the territorially competent occupational health inspectorate. If the employer intends to dismiss an occupational physician, he must submit this to the territorially competent occupational health inspectorate after obtaining the opinion of the institution's advisory committee or the employer's representative. The occupational physician shall express his opinion within a period not exceeding ten days from the date of notification. The dismissal is considered arbitrary if it is carried out without respecting the procedures stipulated in the second paragraph of this chapter.

Crimes punishable by death or imprisonment exceeding five years are classified as felonies within the meaning of this law.  Crimes punishable by imprisonment exceeding fifteen days but not exceeding five years, or by a fine exceeding sixty dinars, are classified as misdemeanors. Crimes punishable by imprisonment not exceeding fifteen days or a fine not exceeding sixty dinars are classified as infractions. (Article 122 of the Code of Criminal Procedure)

The dismissal is considered arbitrary if the competent courts find no genuine and serious reason justifying the dismissal.
