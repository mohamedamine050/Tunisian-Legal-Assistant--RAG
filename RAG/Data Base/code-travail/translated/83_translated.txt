Exceptionally, the competent labor inspectorate may:

1. Authorize the employer to extend the working period under certain exceptional circumstances to carry out urgent work in the event of accidents, necessary repairs, or rescue operations.

2. Authorize the employer to extend the working period in the event of an unusual increase in the volume of work, provided that the daily working period does not exceed 10 hours.

In both cases mentioned above, the extended working periods must be compensated with equivalent rest periods during the year.

This compensation shall be effected by reducing at least one hour from the working period, and if this is not possible during the year, the compensation shall be effected during the first three months of the following year, before the commencement of a new authorized working period.

3. Approve certain permanent exceptions to the daily working period for certain employees performing preparatory or additional work that must be completed outside the limit imposed on general work, provided that the daily working period does not exceed 10 hours.
