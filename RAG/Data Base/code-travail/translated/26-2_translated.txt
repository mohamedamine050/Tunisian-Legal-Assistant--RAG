An agreement may be concluded between the lessor and the employee, whereby the latter undertakes to continue working in the establishment in exchange for benefiting from vocational training or skill development at the lessor's expense, for a minimum period proportionate to the costs of this training or skill development, provided that this period shall not in any case exceed four years. In the event of the employee's breach of this agreement, the lessor may demand the reimbursement of the training or skill development expenses in proportion to the remaining period of the agreement's execution.
