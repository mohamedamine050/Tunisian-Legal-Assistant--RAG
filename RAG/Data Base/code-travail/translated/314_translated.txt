Liability for payment rests upon the owners or managers of the establishment; or, in the case of the owner's ignorance, upon the holders, users, or occupants of the establishments subject to the payment.

If the exploitation of the establishment is in the hands of a company, the partners are jointly and severally liable for the payment, and those who pay have a right of recourse against the others for their respective shares.

Heirs, legatees, and their representatives and successors may be pursued jointly and severally; and one of them may be pursued for the entire amount of payments outstanding against the estate of the person they inherited from or succeeded.
