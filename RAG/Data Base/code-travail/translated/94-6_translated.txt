Overtime hours are considered those performed by a part-time employee beyond the normal working hours stipulated in the employment contract.  Performing overtime requires the agreement of both parties, provided that the number of these hours does not exceed one-third of the working hours stipulated in the employment contract, and that the total of these hours and overtime does not exceed the normal working hours of a full-time employee in the same establishment.
