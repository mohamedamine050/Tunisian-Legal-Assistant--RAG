Professional identification cards are issued by the Governor of the region where the applicant's headquarters is located.

The applicant is the person who took the initiative to begin the legal proceedings. Or, if necessary, the Governor's representative or the Mayor.

The authority issuing the card may also issue a temporary substitute document in its place.
