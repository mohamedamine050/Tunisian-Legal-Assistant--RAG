Occupational health services, whether private or in the form of associations, primarily play a preventative role in occupational health.  They are specifically tasked with examining and monitoring the health and physical fitness of workers to perform the required tasks, both at the time of recruitment and during employment.  They are also responsible for protecting workers from hazards that may affect their health due to their profession.  The Labour Inspectorate may, directly or at the request of the Occupational Health service, conduct a medical examination of children under eighteen years of age who have been accepted for work, to determine whether the work assigned is beyond their capacity. If this is found to be the case, authorization may be given to stop the child from that work.
