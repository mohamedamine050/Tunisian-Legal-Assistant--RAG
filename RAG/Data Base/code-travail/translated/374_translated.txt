Children may not be employed in the institutions referred to in Article 372 unless they possess sufficient physical capacity to perform the work assigned to them.

Labor inspectors have the permanent right to demand the removal of children aged between thirteen and sixteen years who are employed in the aforementioned institutions.

They are granted the same right if these children suffer from an apparent illness or disability, provided this is confirmed by a specialist physician following an in-person examination, if requested by the parents.
