Every lessor shall keep a register containing the names and date of birth of all persons working for him who are under eighteen years of age, the nature of their activity, the number of hours worked, their rest periods, and the certificate attesting to their eligibility for work, provided that it does not contain medical data. This register shall be presented to labor inspectors and occupational health inspectors.

Occupational health services, whether private or in the form of associations, primarily play a preventive role in the field of occupational health. They are specifically responsible for examining and monitoring the health and physical fitness of workers to perform the work required of them, both upon recruitment and during employment, as well as protecting them from hazards that may threaten their health due to their profession, and to worker representatives upon their request.
