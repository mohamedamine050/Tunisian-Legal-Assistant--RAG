Where applicable, the certificate should also detail the tasks undertaken, specifying the duration of each.  Employment certificates issued to workers are exempt from stamp duty and registration, even if they contain data other than that specified in the preceding paragraph, and are free from any obligation, receipt, or imposed agreement.

The worker may not waive in advance his right to claim compensation under the provisions of this chapter.
