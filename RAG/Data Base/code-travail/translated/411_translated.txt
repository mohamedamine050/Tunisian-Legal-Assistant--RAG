The consequences of unilateral termination of an employment contract, unless the other party committed a serious fault, are determined as follows:

Firstly: If the termination occurs during the probationary period, no compensation is payable.

Secondly: In other cases, if the termination is due to the employer's action, the employee is entitled to:

1. (If the contract is indefinite):

    a. In the event of non-observance of the notice period as determined by custom or, in the absence of custom, according to the agreement, the employee is entitled to compensation equal to all direct or indirect benefits they would have received during the notice period.

    b. If the notice period was observed, the employee is entitled to compensation for wrongful termination, if any.

    To determine the compensation to be granted, if necessary, consideration will be given to custom, the type of services performed by the employee, their seniority, their age, the amount withheld, amounts deducted for retirement contributions, and generally all circumstances that demonstrate the harm suffered and its significance.


If a change occurs in the legal status of the employer, particularly through inheritance, sale, merger, transformation of the enterprise, or the formation of a company, all employment contracts referred to in the first paragraph of Article 409 and in effect on the day of the change remain in effect between the new owner of the enterprise and the traveling representatives, agents, and promoters attached to the enterprise.  The cessation of the enterprise's activity – unless due to force majeure – does not exempt the owner from the obligation to respect the notice period for termination.

The parties may not beforehand waive their right to claim damages, according to the provisions set forth above, which are enforceable even if the employee is bound by employment contracts with multiple employers.

The privilege provided for in paragraph 4 of Article 1630 of the Code of Obligations and Contracts applies to the compensation provided for above, whether for non-observance of the notice period or for wrongful termination of the contract.

2. (If the termination is before the expiry of a fixed-term contract):

    a. The employee is entitled to compensation equal to all direct or indirect benefits they would have received until the natural expiry of the contract, taking into account the benefits the employee receives as a result of the termination of the contract.

    b. Compensation for wrongful termination, if any.
