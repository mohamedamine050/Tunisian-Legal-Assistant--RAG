Landlords in fields of activity where workers are not usually continuously employed by the same landlord during the period considered for assessing entitlement to leave, must pay contributions to the National Social Security Fund according to fees and a specific method determined by a decision of the Secretary of State for Youth, Sports, and Social Affairs.  In this case, the Fund is responsible for paying the allowances corresponding to the worker's leave entitlement, at the times stipulated in the same decision.

Regional funds responsible for assessing leave entitlement and calculating the allowance to be paid to beneficiaries must specify – in the breakdown of the service period calculation and in light of the necessary evidence – the period of service actually completed, where applicable, with landlords who are required to enroll in the National Social Security Fund.

The National Social Security Fund may appoint inspectors tasked with assisting in monitoring the application of the legislative regulations concerning paid leave by the relevant landlords.

With regard to institutions required to enroll in the National Social Security Fund to pay paid leave allowances, the National Social Security Fund undertakes, within its professional jurisdiction, to pay allowances related to the leave of young workers, at a rate of one-half for beneficiaries aged eighteen and over, and at a rate of one-third for beneficiaries aged between eighteen and twenty.

The landlord pays the full allowance and then recovers it from the National Social Security Fund according to the aforementioned percentages.

The National Social Security Fund must include in its annual activity report the percentage of reimbursements made, as mentioned above, and the number of beneficiaries. This report is submitted to the Secretary of State for Youth, Sports, and Social Affairs before April 1st of each year.
