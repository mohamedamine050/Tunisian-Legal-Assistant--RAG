The Labor Department must attempt conciliation before adjudicating the case.

Conciliation [1] is an agreement to resolve a dispute and end litigation, achieved by each party relinquishing some of their claims or by the delivery of money or a right. [2] It is an agreement by which the parties terminate an existing dispute or prevent a potential one, each reciprocally relinquishing their right.  This must occur between the parties in the deliberation room, with this being stated in the judgment; otherwise, it is considered void.

The case may not be adjourned for conciliation more than twice, with each adjournment not exceeding 15 days.

The court must adjudicate only those parts of the claim [1] a request by one party for their right from another in the presence of the judge; the requester is called the claimant and the requested party is called the defendant. [2] A claim is the right of any claimant to bring their case before the court for judgment on its merits.  It is, for the opposing party, the right to present grounds of defense or arguments aimed at refuting that claim, which are admitted by the defendant—the person against whom the claim is directed or the person standing to claim—immediately. Only the parts of the claim whose validity is disputed shall be referred for judgment. If the debtor refuses to plead immediately, the content of the hearing record, signed by the presiding judge and the clerk, shall have the force of a judgment.

This judgment—a written decision of the court resolving a legal or factual issue—is not subject to any form of appeal, regardless of the amount admitted.
