An employee-husband is entitled to an additional day of leave for each Mother's Day.

This leave is to be taken after agreement between the employer and the employee, either on Mother's Day itself or within the following seven days.

In this instance, the employee receives remuneration equivalent to the wages he would have received had he worked that day.

This remuneration is paid by the employer on the payday immediately following the expiration of this leave, and the employer is reimbursed by the National Social Security Fund upon submission of supporting documentation.
