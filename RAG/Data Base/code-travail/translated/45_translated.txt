Joint agreements of institutions may only be implemented from the day following their submission in triplicate to the court clerk of the court having jurisdiction over customary law matters in the place where they were concluded.  The party showing the greater diligence shall effect the aforementioned submission. The court clerk, a judicial official responsible for maintaining the court records and managing court documents, shall forward two copies of the signed joint agreement – one to the Ministry of Youth, Sports, and Social Affairs and the other to the competent labor inspectorate in the relevant territorial jurisdiction – within two days following the submission of the agreement. Any interested person may freely consult the joint labor agreements at the court where they were deposited. Copies conforming to the original may be provided at the person's expense.
