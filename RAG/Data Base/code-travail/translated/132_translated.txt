If a contract for a specific period of work is concluded, the contract is a legally binding agreement that obligates the contracting parties and defines their obligations and rights concerning the specific transaction.  The lessor must enable the worker to enjoy his leave in a manner that allows said leave to end at least one week before the expiration of that contract; otherwise, a penalty is incurred.
