Children under the age of eighteen years may not be employed in any activity unless a thorough examination proves their fitness to perform the work entrusted to them. This examination includes, where necessary, clinical, radiological, and laboratory tests. However, certain non-industrial activities may be exempted by order taken after consultation with the relevant professional organizations of employers and workers.  The medical examination for fitness to work is carried out free of charge by the occupational physician, and this must be noted in the register referred to in Article 59 of this Code. The medical certificate of fitness to work may specify certain working conditions, or be issued for a specific job, a set of jobs, or for a specific period. The employer must retain the medical certificate of fitness to work and make it available for inspection by the Labour Inspectorate and the Occupational Health Inspectorate.
