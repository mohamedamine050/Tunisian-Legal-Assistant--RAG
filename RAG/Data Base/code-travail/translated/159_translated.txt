For the purposes of this chapter, a homeworker is considered as such regardless of the existence of a legal relationship between him and his landlord, or of direct and regular supervision by his landlord, and regardless of whether the premises where he works and the equipment he uses are his property or not, and whether he is the one who procures the raw materials for his work or not.  This applies to anyone who meets the following conditions:

Firstly, he performs work—either directly or indirectly—in exchange for a lump sum payment for the benefit of one or more industrial, commercial, or traditional establishments of any kind, even if they have a vocational training or charitable aspect.

Secondly, he uses the services of one of his spouses or children under his guardianship, as defined in Article 54 of the Law No. 14 of December 1960 relating to the social security system.

A person retains the status of homeworker if, at the same time as performing the work, he produced part or all of the materials used, provided that these raw materials were sold to him by the party who delivers the work and then buys the finished product, or by a supplier designated by the latter, and the producing person is required to procure them exclusively from that supplier.

Only those persons mentioned in the preceding paragraphs who habitually and regularly perform homework, whether continuously or only during certain seasons of the year, are considered members of the establishments.

If they meet the aforementioned conditions in relation to several establishments, they are considered attached to the establishment that paid them the highest wages during the year preceding the year in which their appointment took place.

If the homeworker performs work for the benefit of a subcontractor who is not registered in the commercial register and does not own a commercial establishment, this worker is considered as being affiliated with the establishment for which the subcontractor works.
