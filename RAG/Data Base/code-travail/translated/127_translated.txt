The daily allowance paid to the worker for paid annual leave is equal to the average daily wage he receives or may receive during the year at the establishment for a period equal to the duration of the leave, including all grants and bonuses.  Tangible benefits that the leave recipient does not continue to enjoy during his leave must be valued in cash, and the amount thus determined must be paid in addition to the daily allowance referred to in the preceding paragraph.
