Every application to open a hazardous, health-damaging, or nuisance establishment necessitates the payment of a fixed fee to the state treasury, the amount of which is determined by order 101.  The payment of this fixed fee is required even if the aforementioned application only aims to reopen an establishment previously closed pursuant to Articles 304, 305, and 306.
