When the head of an industrial or commercial establishment contracts with a contractor to perform certain services or provide certain benefits, the head of the establishment,  appointing the necessary workforce himself, shall bear the responsibilities hereinafter specified, regardless of any conflicting clauses:

1. If the work or services are performed in his establishment or its dependencies, the head of the establishment shall substitute for the contractor in the event of the latter's inability to pay, with respect to the workers he employs, in relation to the payment of wages and holiday pay, and compensation for work accidents and occupational diseases, and costs arising from social security systems.

2. If the matter concerns services performed in establishments other than his own, the head of the establishment, who is appointed under Article 30 below, shall be liable – in the event of the contractor's inability to pay – for the payment of wages and holiday pay due to the workers employed by the latter, as well as for the payment of family allowances.

In both cases mentioned above, the affected worker and the National Social Security Fund shall have the right to proceed directly against the head of the establishment for whose benefit the service was performed, in the event of the contractor's inability to pay.
