Occupational health services, whether private or in the form of associations, primarily play a preventative role in the field of occupational health.  They are specifically tasked with examining and monitoring the health and physical fitness of workers to perform the required tasks, both at the time of recruitment and during employment, as well as protecting them from hazards that may threaten their health due to their profession. The organization and operation of occupational health services are regulated by an order adopted after consultation with the relevant professional organizations of employers and workers.
