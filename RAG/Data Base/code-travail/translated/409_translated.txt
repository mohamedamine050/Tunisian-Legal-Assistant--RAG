Agreements concluded between factory owners and traders, on the one hand, and traveling representatives, agents, and promoters, on the other hand, are lease contracts if the traveling representatives, agents, or promoters working for one or more institutions and receiving a portion or a fixed salary perform their aforementioned work on a continuous basis, to the exclusion of any other work, and do not engage in any transaction for their personal benefit, and are bound to the institution they represent by a contract specifying the type of goods they are entrusted to promote, the area in which they are required to conduct their activity, and the amount of wages, grant, or percentage allocated to them.

The provisions of this chapter do not apply to employees entrusted, exceptionally and in addition to their work within the institution, with undertaking some efforts with some clients, and who receive either a salary only or a fixed salary originally, with the institution bearing the costs of their travel and the management and daily monitoring of their activity by the lessor.

These contracts may include a prohibition, during their term, on the traveling representative, agent, or promoter from representing certain institutions or goods.

If the contracts do not stipulate this prohibition, it is imperative that they include, as the case may be, a specification of the institutions or goods represented by the traveling representatives, agents, or promoters, as well as the undertaking not to accept new representations during the term of the contract without prior authorization from the lessor, unless the contracting parties amend this prohibition by an express provision.
