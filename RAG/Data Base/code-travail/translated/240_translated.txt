Anyone who prevents an inspector tasked with inspecting work from performing his duties shall be punished by a fine ranging from 144 to 720 dinars, regardless of the application of the provisions of the Criminal Code that punish the violation of the inviolability of a public official.  A public official is a person employed by the government to perform public duties while in the performance of his duties. In the event of recidivism, the penalty shall be doubled.
