The arbitrary termination of an employment contract by either party entitles the claimant to compensation beyond the due allowance, for failure to observe the notice period for termination of employment or the end-of-service gratuity referred to in Article 22 of this Code.  Waiver of the right to claim compensation for damages is not permitted.

[1] Harm is defined as an injury inflicted in violation of the law, affecting a person's body, mental or psychological health, reputation, property, or honor. [2] Loss or damage to property, deprivation of comfort, or damage to physical well-being, reputation, or similar. â€“ In crimes and quasi-crimes, harm is the loss actually suffered by the claimant and the necessary expenses that he was or will be compelled to incur to repair the consequences of the act that caused him harm, as well as any benefit he was deprived of within the normal limits of the consequences of this act.


Any claim to recover compensation for the arbitrary termination of an employment contract by either party must be submitted to the Labor Department's office within one year following the termination; otherwise, the claim shall be extinguished.
