The employment of children under the age of sixteen is permitted only in establishments where family members work, under the authority of the father, mother, or guardian, provided that such employment does not negatively impact the health, physical and mental development, and education of these children.  The provisions of the preceding paragraph do not apply to the work referred to in Article 58 of this Code, which is inherently dangerous – by its nature or the circumstances in which it is performed – to the life, health, or morals of those entrusted with it.
