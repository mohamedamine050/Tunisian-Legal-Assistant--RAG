The eligibility of children to perform the work they undertake must be subject to continuous medical monitoring until the age of eighteen.  A child may only remain in their work upon renewal of the medical examination every six months. The Labour Inspectorate and the Occupational Health Inspectorate may request special renewals of the medical examination.  Occupational health services, whether private or in the form of associations, primarily perform a preventive role in the field of occupational health. They are specifically responsible for examining and monitoring the health and physical fitness of workers to perform the required tasks, both upon recruitment and during employment, as well as protecting them from hazards that may threaten their health due to their profession.
