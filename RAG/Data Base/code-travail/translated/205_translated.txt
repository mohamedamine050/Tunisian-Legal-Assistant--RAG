If the plaintiff or his representative receives the summons directly from the Registry of the Labour Court and fails to appear on the day specified in the summons, the case shall be dismissed and cannot be resubmitted except after eight days.

If the plaintiff is summoned by mail or administrative means and fails to appear on the day specified in the summons, he shall be summoned again.  If he fails to appear again, the case shall be dismissed and cannot be resubmitted except after eight days.

However, the defendant has the right to request consideration of the case if the plaintiff fails to appear after direct summons or the second summons, as the case may be.

If the plaintiff resubmits the case, he forfeits the right to rely on the provisions of Article 212 of this Code and shall be subject to the same obligations concerning cases referred to the courts of general jurisdiction, for workers of the same type of claim.
