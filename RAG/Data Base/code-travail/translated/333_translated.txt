In all fields of activity where employment is subject to labor legislation, landlords are required to provide each of their workers, on the first of May each year, two work outfits, shoes, a hat, and two shirts of the type commonly used in the profession.

The expenses thereof shall be borne equally by the landlord and the worker, and the latter's share shall be deducted from his wages in installments over a period of at least four months.

However, provisions that are more beneficial to the worker, resulting from general administrative decisions that do not relate to a specific person, joint agreements, or customs, shall not be violated.
