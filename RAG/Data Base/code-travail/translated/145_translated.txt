The employee's receipt of their payslip without protest or reservation does not constitute a waiver, on their part, of any portion of their full salary, or of any bonuses or additions to salary to which they are entitled by virtue of legal, regulatory, or contractual provisions, or provisions arising from collective agreements, arbitration decisions, or decisions of the Regional Agricultural Labour Committees.  Furthermore, this acceptance may not be considered as a "settled and outstanding account".
