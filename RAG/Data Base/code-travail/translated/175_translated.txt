Labor inspectors may authorize measures to remedy any defect observed in equipment, installations, or work methods that they may reasonably consider to be a threat to the health or safety of workers.

For this purpose, they may issue a notice to the employer to make the necessary changes to the equipment within a period of not less than four days to comply with the legal, regulatory, or contractual provisions relating to the health and safety of workers, in a strict manner.  Before the expiry of the aforementioned period, the employer may bring an action before the ministry to which the inspector belongs, thus suspending the effect of the notice.

This ministry may, if necessary, appoint a physician from the occupational health inspection service or an expert to prepare a report on the matter. The minister must issue their decision within the month following the filing of the action.

If it appears necessary to make significant changes, especially if they relate to the structure of the establishment, the final deadline for completing these changes may not exceed 18 months.

Regardless of the foregoing provisions, labor inspectors may authorize the immediate implementation of measures in the event of an imminent danger to the health and safety of workers.

If these measures necessitate the partial or total suspension of the establishment's activities, the matter shall be referred by the head of the territorially competent labor inspection service to the competent judicial authority for urgent matters to make a decision.
