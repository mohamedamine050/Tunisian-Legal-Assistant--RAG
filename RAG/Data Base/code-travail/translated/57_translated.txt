The head of the Labour Inspectorate may grant individual work permits to entities engaged in art, science, or education – notwithstanding the provisions of Articles 53 to 56 of this Code – to enable children to appear in public performances or participate as actors or minor actors in the filming of scenes.  The minimum age from which individual work permits may be granted shall be determined by a decision of the Minister responsible for social affairs, taken after consultation with the relevant professional organizations of employers and workers.  The same decision shall also specify the precautions to be taken to preserve the health, development, and morals of the children, and to ensure their humane treatment, suitable comfort, and the continuation of their education.
