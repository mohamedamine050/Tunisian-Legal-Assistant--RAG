In all branches of non-agricultural activity, landlords are required to maintain a register specifying the name and date of birth of all persons under the age of eighteen whom they employ, as well as their working hours and all other instructions related to the conditions of child employment. This register shall be made available to the labor inspectorate. Children and adolescents working on public roads must carry a document stating the details recorded in the aforementioned register.
