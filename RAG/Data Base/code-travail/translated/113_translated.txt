Every worker who proves during the year to which the leave refers that he was employed by the same lessor for a period of not less than one month of actual work is entitled to leave, the duration of which is determined by calculating one day for each month of work, without the total duration of the leave exceeding fifteen days, twelve of which are working days.

The duration of the leave specified in the preceding paragraph is increased to two days for each month of work for workers under the age of eighteen on December 31st of each year, provided that the total duration of the leave does not exceed thirty days, twenty-four of which are working days.

Similarly, the duration of the leave is increased to one and a half days for each month of work for workers whose ages range between eighteen and twenty years on December 31st of each year, provided that the total duration of the leave does not exceed eighteen days, twelve of which are working days.

The workers referred to in the preceding two paragraphs are entitled, upon their request, to the maximum leave mentioned above, regardless of their seniority in the establishment. They may not claim any additional leave allowance in exchange for the leave days they have enjoyed in excess of the days they received resulting from the work performed during the period considered.
