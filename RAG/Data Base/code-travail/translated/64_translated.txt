In establishments of all types, except those employing exclusively members of the same family, women shall:

A.  Upon childbirth, be entitled to a 30-day rest period upon presentation of a medical certificate.

This leave may be extended in increments of 15 days each time, provided that this is justified by medical certificates.

B. In all cases, if breastfeeding her child, be entitled for nine months from the date of childbirth to two 30-minute breaks per day during working hours to enable her to breastfeed her child.

These two breaks are in addition to those provided for in Article 89. One is designated for the morning work session and the other for the afternoon session. Mothers may take these breaks at times agreed upon between them and their employers.  If no agreement is reached, these two breaks shall each be taken in the middle of each work session. These breaks shall be considered working hours and entitle the woman to remuneration.

A special breastfeeding room must be provided in every establishment employing at least fifty women.

The conditions that this breastfeeding room must meet shall be determined by order of the Secretary of State for Youth, Sports and Social Affairs, after consultation with the relevant professional organizations.
