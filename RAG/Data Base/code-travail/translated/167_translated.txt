In the event of a serious error committed by a member, representative, or the person designated by the group to act on its behalf, working on the institution's advisory committee or a deputy to the head of the institution, the head of the institution may immediately suspend the person concerned from work, partially or totally depriving him of his salary. The person concerned must be informed thereof within a maximum period of three days by registered letter with acknowledgment of receipt, specifying the date and reasons for the suspension. The final decision concerning the person concerned must be taken within a period not exceeding one month from the date of suspension from work. If the final decision does not include a penalty of dismissal or deprivation of salary, the employee recovers all his rights.  If it includes deprivation of salary for a period less than the suspension period, he is entitled to recover the salary corresponding to the suspension period exceeding the penalty period.
