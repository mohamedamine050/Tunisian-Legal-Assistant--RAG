Landlords in every establishment employing at least 500 workers must establish and equip a dedicated occupational health service.  Establishments employing fewer than this number must either join an occupational health collective or establish their own occupational health service.  Certain activities or establishments may be exempted from the obligation to establish a dedicated occupational health service or join an occupational health collective, depending on the nature of the occupational hazards involved.  Such exemptions shall be granted by order issued after consultation with the relevant professional organizations.
