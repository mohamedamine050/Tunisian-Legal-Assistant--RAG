The worker receives a grant during their leave period, calculated based on the duration of the leave entitlement on the one hand, and the salary and grants they usually receive during actual work on the other hand. In professions where the salary is partly or wholly comprised of client gifts by virtue of the contract, the salary to be considered for calculating the leave grant is assessed according to the legislation concerning social security systems. The foregoing provisions do not affect the privileges granted by contractual provisions or customs. In the event of the complete or partial closure of the establishment for a period exceeding the annual leave period, the employer must pay the workers concerned, for each working day during which their establishment was closed beyond the aforementioned leave period, a wage that cannot be less than the daily net leave grant.
