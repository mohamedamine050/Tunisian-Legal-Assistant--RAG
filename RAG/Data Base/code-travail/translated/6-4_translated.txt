1. A contract of employment for a fixed term may be concluded in the following cases:

- undertaking the initial work to establish the enterprise or new work;
- undertaking work necessitated by an unusual increase in the volume of work;
- temporary replacement of a permanent employee who is absent or whose employment contract has been suspended;
- undertaking specific work to prevent foreseeable accidents, or to organize rescue operations, or to repair a defect in the equipment, facilities, or buildings of the enterprise;
- undertaking seasonal work or other activities where, by custom or by their nature, recourse to contracts of indeterminate duration is not possible.

2. A contract of employment for a fixed term may also be concluded outside the cases mentioned in the preceding paragraph by agreement between the employer and the employee, provided that the duration of this contract, including renewals, does not exceed four years.  Any engagement of the employee concerned after the expiry of this period shall be based on permanent employment and without being subject to a probationary period. In this case, the contract shall be concluded in writing in duplicate, one copy being retained by the employer and the other given to the employee.

3. Employees engaged under contracts of employment for a fixed term shall receive basic wages and allowances not less than the basic wages and allowances granted under statutory provisions or collective agreements to permanent employees with the same professional qualifications.
