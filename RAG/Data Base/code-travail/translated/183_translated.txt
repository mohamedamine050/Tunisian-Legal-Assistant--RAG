Labor courts are competent to adjudicate individual disputes that may arise between contracting parties upon the execution of employment or training contracts in activities subject to the provisions of this Code.  Their jurisdiction extends to disputes arising between workers in the course of performing work.

However, they do not consider claims resulting from work accidents or occupational diseases, nor do they consider disputes relating to social security systems.

Labor courts shall render their opinion on matters submitted to them by the administrative authority.
