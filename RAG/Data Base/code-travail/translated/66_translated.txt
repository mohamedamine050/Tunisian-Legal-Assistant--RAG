The employment of children over fourteen years of age but under eighteen years of age, and of women, is prohibited during the night, for a continuous period of at least twelve hours, including the time between 10 pm and 6 am. However, the Minister responsible for social affairs may, after consultation with the relevant trade unions, decide on different time slots prohibiting the employment of children, provided that the night rest includes the period between 11 pm and 7 am. This may apply to certain regions, industries, institutions, or branches of these industries and institutions.
