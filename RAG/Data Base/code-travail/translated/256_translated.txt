Trade unions which have not been established in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, or which deviate from their customary and professional role, or whose activities are contrary to the law, may be dissolved by a written judicial decision issued by a primary court under the jurisdiction of its center, at the request of the Public Prosecutorâ€™s Office.  The task of liquidation shall be entrusted to the financial authorities. The judicial decision shall specify whether the remaining assets of the trade union shall be transferred to the state or to an organization which manages social grants for the benefit of persons practicing the same profession as the members of the dissolved trade union.

In the event that the assets revert to the state, the property accruing to the trade unions from donations and bequests less than one year prior for movable property and less than ten years prior for immovable property, as of the date of its dissolution, and which are found among the remaining assets of the trade union, the donor or those to whom their rights devolve may claim their recovery.
