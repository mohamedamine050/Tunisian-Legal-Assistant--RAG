Termination of an employment contract of indefinite duration shall be notified by registered letter with acknowledgment of receipt addressed to the other party one month prior to the termination of the contract.  The employee is authorized to be absent for the entire second half of the notification period to allow them to seek other employment. This absence period shall be considered as actual work time and shall not result in any reduction in wages or allowances.  All of this is without prejudice to provisions more beneficial to the employee resulting from specific clauses included in the parties' agreement, a collective agreement, or custom.
