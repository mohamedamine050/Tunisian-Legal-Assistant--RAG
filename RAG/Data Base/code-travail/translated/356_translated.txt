The supervisor or any person entrusted with vocational training must treat the minor trainee well.  In all places where the latter is under his supervision, he must monitor his behavior and morals and inform his guardians or representatives of any serious mistakes he commits and any malicious tendencies he displays.

He must also inform them without delay in case of illness or absence, or on any other matter that would justify their intervention.

He must protect the trainee from ill-treatment by his colleagues or other persons.

If the minor trainee, under the age of 18, does not know how to read, write, and count, the supervisor is obligated to enable him to take the necessary time and freedom from work for his education; however, this time cannot exceed two hours a day.
