In the event of suspension or termination of an employment contract, and upon issuance of an administrative or judicial decision ordering the definitive or temporary closure of the establishment, or the prohibition of the head of said establishment from practicing his profession, by way of penalty, the latter must continue to receive his salary, including allowances and emoluments of all kinds, for the duration of said closure or prohibition. This obligation ceases after three months have elapsed.  If the closure or prohibition exceeds three months, the head of the establishment – in addition to what is provided for by law or prior agreements – is obliged to pay his employee all damages, whether common, special, or customary, regardless of damages for harm.
