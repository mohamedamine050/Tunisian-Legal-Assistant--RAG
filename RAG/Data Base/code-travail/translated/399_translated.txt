If the termination is due to an action by the lessor that necessitates the payment of a penalty, this penalty cannot be less than one month's salary from the last salary of each year or part of a year spent in the work, with a maximum of fifteen monthly installments.

The matter shall be compulsorily submitted to an arbitration committee, formally assembled of experts from various parts of the institution, to determine the amount of the penalty to be paid if the duration of the work exceeds fifteen years.
