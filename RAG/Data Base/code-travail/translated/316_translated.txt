Owners of institutions subject to the levy whose names have not been entered in the register are required to inform the Engineer, Head of the Mining Department, within fifteen days from the date of publication of the announcement in the Official Gazette regarding the deposit of the aforementioned register with the tax office.  If the owners of the institutions fail to do so, a penalty equal to the amount of the levy demanded will be imposed upon them.

However, the Secretary of State for Planning and National Economy may grant exemption from all or part of this penalty after receiving a request to that effect, written on stamped paper. The penalty, or the portion thereof approved, shall be paid in a single installment and collected simultaneously with the principal levy without further procedures.
