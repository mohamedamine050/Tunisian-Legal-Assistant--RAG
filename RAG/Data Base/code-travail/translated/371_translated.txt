If an employee's contract is terminated after the probationary period for any reason other than the commission of a serious mistake, a demonstration of professional incompetence, or insufficient production resulting from clear negligence, then the employee (is entitled to an end-of-service gratuity) calculated as follows:

- From one to three months of seniority: three days' wages.

- From three to six months of seniority: seven days' wages.

- From six months to one year of seniority: fifteen days' wages.

- After one year of seniority: fifteen days' wages for each year.

The total amount of the end-of-service gratuity cannot exceed ninety days' wages.

The provisions of this section do not prevent the courts from determining the appropriate individual for a position that matches the qualifications and competencies required to perform it, or from awarding higher damages in the event of intentional and wrongful dismissal.
