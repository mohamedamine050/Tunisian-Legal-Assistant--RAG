In the event of a worker's death due to a workplace accident, the Order of Merit may be awarded posthumously by the Ministry of Youth, Sports and Social Affairs without the employer having submitted a proposal to that effect.

In the case provided for in paragraph 2 of Article 436, a member of the deceased worker's family may submit a simple written request to their employer who, if they deem it appropriate, shall submit a proposal for the posthumous award of the said Order, in accordance with the forms stipulated in Article 440.
