The engagement of workers, whether permanent or temporary, is effected either through public employment agencies or directly.

Every employer must inform the territorially competent public employment agency of every engagement within a period not exceeding fifteen days from the date of engagement.

The tasks and operation of public employment agencies are regulated by order.
