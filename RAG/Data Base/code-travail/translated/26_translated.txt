The new lessor shall be jointly and severally liable with the employee – who arbitrarily terminated his employment contract and subsequently offered his services again – for the damages.  The damage [1] is harm inflicted in violation of the law, affecting a person's body, mental or psychological health, honor, property, or reputation; [2] loss or damage to property, deprivation of comfort, or harm to physical well-being, reputation, or the like.  In crimes and quasi-crimes, damage is the actual loss suffered by the claimant and the necessary expenses that he has been or will be compelled to incur to remedy the consequences of the act that caused him harm, as well as what he has been deprived of within the normal limits of the consequences of that act. This liability is attached to the former lessor if he knew that this employee had previously worked for him.
