Labor courts are established by order issued upon a proposal from the Secretary of State for Justice, after consultation with the Secretaries of State concerned.  Consultation means the act of consultation and seeking opinions.

This order also specifies, as needed, the number of branches of the courts and their composition.

The order establishing the court specifies its territorial jurisdiction and the number of its members from among the judges and experts.

Labor courts may be divided into branches, each branch being independent of the others.
