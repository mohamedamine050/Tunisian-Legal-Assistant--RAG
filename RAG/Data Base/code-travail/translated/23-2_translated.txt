Compensation for damages in cases of wrongful dismissal shall consist of a fine ranging from one month's salary to two months' salary for each year of seniority in the institution, provided that this fine shall not, in any case, exceed three years' salary. The judge shall assess the existence and extent of the damage resulting from this dismissal, based in particular on the employee's professional qualifications, seniority in the institution, age, salary, family situation, the impact of this dismissal on his retirement rights, and the extent to which procedures and the circumstances of the actual situation were respected. However, in the event it is determined that the dismissal occurred for a genuine and valid reason but without respecting the legal or contractual procedures, the amount of the fine shall range from one month's salary to four months' salary. The fine shall be assessed according to the nature of the procedures and their impact on the employee's rights. In assessing the fine for wrongful dismissal, the salary received by the employee at the time of termination of the contract shall be considered, taking into account all benefits that do not have the nature of reimbursement of expenses.
