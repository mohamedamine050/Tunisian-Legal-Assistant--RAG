Every foreign national wishing to engage in paid work of any kind in Tunisia must hold an employment contract and a residence permit bearing the phrase "permitted to engage in paid work in Tunisia".  The employment contract shall be concluded for a period not exceeding one year, renewable once. However, the employment contract may be renewed more than once in the case of employing foreign nationals in their institutions operating in Tunisia within the framework of development projects approved by the competent authority. This contract and its renewal must be endorsed by the Minister in charge of employment.  The model of this contract, its granting conditions, and its renewal shall be determined by a decision of the Minister in charge of employment. Foreign nationals cannot be recruited when Tunisian competencies are available in the specializations concerned by the recruitment.
