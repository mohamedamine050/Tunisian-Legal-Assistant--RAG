The defendant, the person against whom the claim is directed, or the person appointed to claim, shall be summoned to the Labour Court by registered letter with acknowledgement of receipt, exempt from postal charges, or by administrative means.

The letter must state the day, month, and year; the name, profession, and address of the claimant; a description of the subject matter of the claim; and the day and time of the hearing. The time limit for appearance is eight days. The President of the Labour Court may authorize a shorter summons, even at short notice.

If the aforementioned deadline is not respected, the summons shall be considered null and void; however, this nullity is waived upon the defendantâ€™s appearance.

The President of the Labour Court may, on his own initiative or at the request of the claimant, summon the defendant, the person against whom the claim is directed, or the person appointed to claim, to appear at the hearing by a bailiff (amended by Law No. 18 of 2006 dated May 2, 2006).

The President of the Labour Court shall authorize the summoning of the defendant, the person against whom the claim is directed, or the person appointed to claim, by a bailiff if the summons was not personally served (added by Law No. 18 of 2006 dated May 2, 2006).
