The joint work agreement is an agreement concerning the conditions of work concluded between the employers organized as a group or acting individually, on the one hand, and a trade union or several trade unions of workers, on the other hand. This agreement must be in writing; otherwise, it is null and void. In each establishment within the scope of application of the agreement, the provisions of that agreement shall govern the relationships arising from individual or collective contracts, unless the conditions of that contract are more beneficial to the workers than the conditions of the joint agreement.  In establishments subject to a joint agreement, the head of the establishment must post a notice in the places where work is performed, as well as in the establishments where employment takes place, and on their doors. This notice must contain information on the existence of the joint agreement, the contracting parties, the date and place of deposit, and a copy of the agreement must be made available upon request. With regard to agricultural workers, freelance workers, and individual workers or those working from home, it is only required to post the notice at the municipality to which their place of residence belongs; if there is none, then at the governorate office, upon the initiative of the employer covered by the agreement.
