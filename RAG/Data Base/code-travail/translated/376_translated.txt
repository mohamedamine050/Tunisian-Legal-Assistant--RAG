Any difficulty arising between the lessor and the lessee that may give rise to a dispute, a legal dispute or disagreement between two parties, concerning collective employment, must be submitted to the institution's advisory committee to find solutions satisfactory to both parties.  If the dispute is not resolved within the institution, it must be submitted by the more diligent party to the regional conciliation office, and if this fails, to the territorially competent labor inspectorate.
