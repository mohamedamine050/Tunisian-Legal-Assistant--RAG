The data specified in the card referred to in the previous section must be recorded in a book designated as the "Payment Book," which may be inspected by labor inspectors at any time.

Upon each payment, the worker shall sign opposite his name in this book. If he is unable to sign or does not know how to sign, the payment shall be attested by two witnesses of his choosing. The Payment Book shall be maintained chronologically, and it shall not contain any blank spaces, erasures, additions, deletions, or annexes not approved by the worker.
