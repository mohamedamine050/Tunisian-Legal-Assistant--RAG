The minimum age for admission to any type of work which, by its nature or the circumstances in which it is performed, may endanger the health, safety, or morals of children shall not be less than eighteen years. The types of work referred to in the preceding paragraph shall be determined by a decision of the Minister responsible for social affairs, taken after consultation with the most representative professional organizations of employers and workers. Notwithstanding the provisions of the first paragraph of this chapter, the Labour Inspectorate, after obtaining the opinion of the Occupational Health Inspectorate and consultation with the most representative organizations of employers and workers, may authorize the employment of children in such work from the age of sixteen, provided that the health, safety, and morals of the children concerned are fully preserved and that they receive appropriate special education or vocational training in the relevant branch of activity.  Occupational health services, whether private or in the form of associations, primarily play a preventive role in the field of occupational health. They are specifically responsible for examining and monitoring the health and physical fitness of workers to perform the work required of them, both upon recruitment and during employment, as well as protecting them from hazards that may affect their health due to their profession.
