The resources of the occupational medicine centers consist of contributions from institutions, the proceeds of their activities, the income from their assets, donations and bequests, and all other resources that may be allocated to them by virtue of the laws and regulations in force.  The contributions of institutions are regulated by order and are paid directly to the centers.  Savings that the occupational medicine centers may achieve are used to develop their activities.  The activities of these centers do not result in the distribution of profits.
