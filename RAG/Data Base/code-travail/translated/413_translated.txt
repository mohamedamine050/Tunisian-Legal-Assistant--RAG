In the event of termination of an indefinite-term contract by the lessor, and the termination was not due to an error committed by the traveling representative, agent, or promoter, and also in the event of invalidity of the contract due to an accident or illness affecting the commercial representative, agent, or promoter, showing a complete and continuous inability to work, the employee is entitled to compensation for the clientele personally attributed to him, considering the importance and value of the clients he brought, discovered, or developed, taking into account the special grants awarded during the contract for the same purpose, and considering the potential decrease in the number of expected clients before his undertaking, caused by the commercial representative, agent, or promoter.

Every contract is a legally binding agreement that obligates the contracting parties and defines their obligations and rights regarding the specific transaction.  A contract for a definite period requires the same compensation if the contract is terminated before its expiry or if the contract is not renewed upon its expiry, and the lessor is responsible for the termination without any fault committed by the traveling representative, agent, or promoter.

The compensation stipulated in the preceding paragraph must be distinct from the compensation that may be due according to the previous provisions and from the compensation that may be due in the event of termination of a contract before its expiry due to non-performance of obligations arising from a contract concluded for a definite period.

It is not possible to set this compensation in advance by agreement of the parties.
