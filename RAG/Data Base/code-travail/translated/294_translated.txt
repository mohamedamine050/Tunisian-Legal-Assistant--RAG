[2] Loss or damage to property, deprivation of comfort, or harm to physical well-being, reputation, or similar.  - In crimes and quasi-crimes, harm is the loss actually suffered by the claimant and the necessary expenses that he has been or will be obliged to incur to repair the consequences of the act committed to his detriment, as well as what he has been deprived of within the normal limits of the consequences of this act resulting from its exploitation.
