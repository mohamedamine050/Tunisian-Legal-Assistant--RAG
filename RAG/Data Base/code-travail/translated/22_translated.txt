Every employee bound by an indefinite-term contract who is dismissed after the probationary period has ended is entitled, except in the case of gross misconduct, to an end-of-service bonus calculated at one day's wage for each month of actual work in the same establishment. This is based on the wage received by the employee at the time of dismissal, taking into account all allowances that are not in the nature of expense reimbursements.  This bonus cannot exceed three months' wages, regardless of the actual length of service, except where better conditions are provided for by law, collective agreements, or individual agreements.
