Contract

A contract is a legally binding agreement that obligates the contracting parties and defines their obligations and rights with respect to the specific transaction.

Employment is an agreement whereby one party, called a worker or employee, undertakes to provide services to the other party, called the employer, under the latter's management and supervision, in exchange for remuneration. The employment relationship is proven by all means of proof.
