The wage for workers, of all categories, is determined either by direct agreement between the parties or through a collective agreement, while respecting the guaranteed minimum wage set by order.  Wages for workers in sectors not subject to collective agreements may be set by order. The orders referred to in the preceding paragraph are taken after consultation with the most representative employer and worker trade unions.
