Whenever the lessor intends to dismiss an official member or alternate representative appointed by the group to act on its behalf, working on the institution's advisory committee, he must submit this to the institution's advisory committee to obtain its opinion.  He must then submit the matter to the Director General of the Labour Inspection and Conciliation Department, who shall give a reasoned opinion within a period not exceeding ten days from the date of his undertaking.

Whenever the lessor intends to dismiss an official deputy or alternate member working on the committee, he must submit the matter to the Director General of the Labour Inspection and Conciliation Department, who shall give a reasoned opinion within the same timeframe as specified in the preceding paragraph.

Dismissal shall be considered arbitrary if the procedures stipulated in the first and second paragraphs of this chapter are not respected. Dismissal shall also be considered arbitrary in the event of a violation described as: felonies, meaning crimes punishable by death or imprisonment exceeding five years; misdemeanors, meaning crimes punishable by imprisonment exceeding fifteen days but not exceeding five years, or a fine exceeding sixty dinars; or offenses, meaning crimes punishable by imprisonment not exceeding fifteen days or a fine not exceeding sixty dinars (Article 122 of the Code of Criminal Procedure).  The opinion of the Director General of the Labour Inspection and Conciliation Department shall be binding, unless the competent courts establish a genuine and serious reason justifying such dismissal.

Both the lessor and the employee retain the right to appeal to the competent courts.
