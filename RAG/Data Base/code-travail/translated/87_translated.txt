Every head of an establishment wishing to apply the decision relating to the manufacture of work with the powers conferred upon him by Article 83-1 is obligated to address to the Labor Inspectorate a registered and dated notice specifying the type and reason for the exception, the number of workers and employees whose work period will be extended, the days during which work will take place using that capacity, and the scheduled working and rest hours.  The head of the establishment must, in addition, regularly maintain a schedule that outlines – according to the notification to the Labor Inspectorate – the dates of the days on which work takes place under this permit, specifying its duration. This schedule shall be posted at the premises according to the conditions specified in Article 85 and shall remain posted throughout the current year until January 15th of the following year.
