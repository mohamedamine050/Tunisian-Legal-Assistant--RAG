Each member of a professional association may withdraw at any time from the association.  The association is an agreement between two or more persons whereby they work permanently to achieve objectives, excluding the pursuit of profit, notwithstanding any conflicting provision.  However, the association retains the right to claim membership fees for the six months following the withdrawal.  Any person withdrawing from an association retains the right to membership in the cooperative and retirement societies established by and contributed to by that association, either through membership or financial contribution.
