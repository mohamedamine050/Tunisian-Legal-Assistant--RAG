Collection is postponed.
Collection is postponed.
Collection is the process by which the creditor obtains payment from the debtor of the financial debt contracted towards him.

The specified payment is contested by a claim for exemption or reduction or referral until the application addressed to the Engineer Head of the Mining Department is considered, or, if necessary, until the court judgment in the case is rendered.

This is also postponed if this payment is modified by the competent court or the Secretary of State for Planning and National Economy, and the latter shall cancel the wrongly registered amounts from the payment schedule.
