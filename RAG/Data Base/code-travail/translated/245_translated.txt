Professional trade unions may allocate a portion of their resources to the construction of low-cost housing and the acquisition of land for the establishment of leisure centers or facilities for physical education or health preservation.

They may also establish and manage employment information offices, and may create, manage, or provide financial assistance for projects related to workshops, laboratories, experimental fields, and projects in scientific, agricultural, social, and professional training, and organize courses and publications relevant to their activities.

Real estate and furniture necessary for the unions' activities, their libraries, and courses are not subject to any form of seizure.  The same applies to the funds of their special mutual aid and retirement funds, concerning retirement pensions and capital insured by cooperative societies, in accordance with current legislation.
