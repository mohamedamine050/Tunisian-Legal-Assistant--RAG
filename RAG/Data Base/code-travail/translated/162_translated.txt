In institutions with multiple branches employing forty or more permanent workers in each branch, advisory committees shall be established for those branches.  Their composition and operation shall be similar to the composition and operation of the institution's advisory committee, and they shall have the same responsibilities within the scope of authority granted to the heads of these branches.  Furthermore, a central advisory committee for the institution shall be established. This committee's role will be to coordinate the work of the branch advisory committees and to consider matters requiring study at the central level. This committee shall be composed of worker representatives elected by worker representatives on the branch advisory committees, and from among them, and of management representatives appointed by the institution's management, taking into account the principle of parity.
