Public or private institutions, cooperatives, and associations whose activities are primarily focused on the following fields are considered to have an agricultural character:

Cultivation of cereals, flax, cotton, tobacco, rice, potatoes, sugar beet, medicinal and aromatic plants, vegetables, grapes, legumes, flowers, gourds, olives, fruit trees, forest trees, seed and nursery production, dried herbs, animal husbandry, milk production, poultry and beekeeping.

Workers employed in the following are considered agricultural workers:

1. All work intrinsically necessary for carrying out their activities in the aforementioned fields.

2. Minor repairs necessary for buildings and machinery.

3. Collection, preservation, and packaging of the institution's products.

The following are not considered agricultural institutions but rather commercial and industrial establishments, even if they are structured as agricultural cooperatives:

1. Credit and guarantee institutions.

2. Rural engineering institutions.

3. Saltworks.

4. Institutions engaged in land preparation, harvesting, threshing, collection, transportation, and storage of crops, except those specifically assigned to an agricultural farm.

5. Oil mills, presses, distilleries, milk and cheese factories, and preserving factories; and in general, all factories and parts of factories intended for the processing of agricultural products, even if attached to an agricultural farm, except for factories operating solely using traditional methods for processing raw materials.

6. Forest product institutions (such as uprooting and cutting trees and collecting cork), unless such work is specific to a forest owned by the operator.

Persons responsible for the management of agricultural institutions are not considered agricultural workers; rather, they are considered similar to persons responsible for managing commercial and industrial institutions.
