Professional associations enjoy legal personality.

They have the right to bring actions before the courts and to acquire movable and immovable property in accordance with the same general law, whether for consideration or gratuitously.

They may exercise before all courts all the rights granted to a civil party in relation to events that directly or indirectly harm the common interest of the profession they represent.
