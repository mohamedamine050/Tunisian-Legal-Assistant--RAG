The lawsuit [1] is a request by one party for their right from another in the presence of a judge; the requester is called the plaintiff and the requested party is called the defendant. [2] A lawsuit is the right of every claimant to bring their claim before the court for a judgment on its subject matter.  For the defendant, it is the right to present reasons for defense or arguments aimed at refuting that claim.

A written request is submitted to the clerk of the labor court and, in return, a summons is immediately issued stating the case number and the hearing date. The claim petition must include the name, surname, profession, and address of the plaintiff and the defendant, and the subject matter of the lawsuit and the plaintiff's requests.

The request may also be submitted to the court clerk via registered mail. In this case, the summons is sent to the claimant or their chosen representative by registered mail exempt from postal fees.

The court clerk must register the petition on the day of receipt in the designated register and then submit it to the court president.
