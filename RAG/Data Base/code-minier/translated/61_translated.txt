The right of exploitation may not be transferred or assigned, wholly or partially, except by virtue of a license granted by a decision of the Minister in charge of mines, based on the approval of the Advisory Committee for Mines. This decision shall be published in the Official Gazette of the Republic of Tunisia.

This license may be refused under the same conditions and for the same reasons as those required for the request for a right of exploitation, as stipulated in Article 44 of this Code.

No new terms and conditions that impose **obligations** on the grantee that exceed those undertaken by the previous holder of the right of exploitation may be imposed on the applicant.

However, transfers between affiliated companies are exempted from this license requirement, provided that the granting authority is notified beforehand.
