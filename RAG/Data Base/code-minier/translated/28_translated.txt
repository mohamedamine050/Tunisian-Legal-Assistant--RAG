The exploration license is granted while preserving the rights of third parties that have been lawfully acquired. If an application for an exploration license encompasses an area exceeding the boundaries of an existing exploration license or exploitation concession pertaining to the same group of mineral substances and still in effect, the license shall only be granted for the area that lies outside the boundaries of such license or concession.

Should it become known after the granting of the exploration license that the boundaries exceed the permitted limits, the boundaries of this license may be rectified by a decision taken by the Minister in charge of Mines, either automatically or upon request from any interested party.
