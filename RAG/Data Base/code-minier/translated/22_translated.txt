An application for a research license shall not be accepted unless it relates to an area consisting of one or more contiguous primary perimeters, as defined in Article 23 of this Code.

However, an application for a research license may be accepted for a defined area that extends across international boundaries, encompassing portions of primary perimeters.

A separate application must be submitted for each area comprising a whole number of contiguous primary perimeters, as well as for each group of mineral materials classified as "mines."

No amendment may be made to the registered application with respect to the group of mineral materials concerned or the area requested.
