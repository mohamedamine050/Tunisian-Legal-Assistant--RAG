If the exploitation works of a mine cause material damage to an adjacent or superimposed mine for any reason, particularly in case of water seepage exceeding the natural flow rate of this water, the licensee responsible for this malfunction shall repair the resulting damage. If the same works lead to the diversion of water to another mine, partially or entirely, whether by machine or by tunnel excavation, the owner of the affected mine is entitled to compensation for the damage sustained. The value of this compensation shall be determined based on a test authorized by the competent court, provided there is an amicable agreement.
