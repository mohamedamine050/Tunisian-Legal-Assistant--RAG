The exploitation concessionaire shall provide the Ministry responsible for mines, on a monthly basis, with all statistical information concerning the preceding month's activities, which relates to workforce, production of extracted materials and their marketing, productivity, mining equipment and its uses.

Furthermore, the concessionaire shall provide the Ministry, within the first trimester of each year, with copies of the work performed during the preceding year, accompanied by an annual report regarding the activities and expenses carried out within the framework of the annual budgets and programs submitted to the granting authority.

The holder of an exploration permit or an exploitation concession is obligated to provide the Ministry responsible for mines with all information in their possession pertaining to geological, geophysical, hydrological, mining, and economic aspects.

This information cannot be published to the general public or communicated to third parties by the administration without the prior written consent of the permit holder, except for aggregate statistics and documents related to general geology and inventory of water resources.

However, this consent becomes non-binding if the information concerns areas related to exploration permits and exploitation concessions, or one of them, which has been returned to the granting authority.

The officials of the Ministry responsible for mines may, during their visits, verify the charts and records related to the progress of the mining activity.

If the charts relating to the progress of work are not updated, the administration may undertake their preparation by virtue of a decision issued by the Minister responsible for mines, and at the expense of the permit holder concerned.

The permit holder is required to inform the relevant administration of the locations of archaeological and historical sites discovered during the execution of exploration or exploitation activities, and to ensure their preservation in accordance with the legislation in force.
