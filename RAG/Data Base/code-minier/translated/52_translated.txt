The exploitation concession is granted for a duration determined based on the importance of the reserves that can be exploited. This period can be extended whenever it appears necessary and based on additional discovered reserves.

Any request for an extension of the exploitation concession must be submitted to the Ministry responsible for Mines at least two years before the expiry date of its validity, with a receipt being issued for the same.
