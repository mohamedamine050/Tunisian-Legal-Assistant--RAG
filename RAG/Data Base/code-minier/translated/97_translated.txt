The taxable **profit** for each exploitation concession is determined separately, in accordance with the rules stipulated in the Tax Code on Personal Income Tax and Corporate Tax. However, the results from all exploitation concessions held by the licensee can be combined for the purpose of calculating the tax on profits.

The taxable **profit** is determined after deducting the following:

- Mining royalties actually paid,
- Interest expenses related to development investments required for exploitation of deposits, within a borrowing limit not exceeding seventy percent of these investments,
- Depreciation of expenses related to immovable property at a rate not exceeding twenty percent per year for all expenses incurred by the licensee.

The costs of studies, exploration, and research can be calculated at the licensee's discretion as either expenses deductible for the **fiscal year** in which they were incurred, or as fixed expenses depreciated over a period of five years.
- Savings constituting a mining reserve renewal fund, up to a limit of fifty percent of the taxable **profit**. These savings must be used before the end of the third year from the date of their constitution to implement a program approved by the Ministry responsible for mines, particularly for:
    1. Research planned to be carried out on objectives not included in the exploitation concession granted,
    2. Developing new deposits of mineral resources,
    3. Implementing projects to retrain and redirect employees working in the mining sector.

The surplus of any unused account from each savings fund is included in the **fiscal year** results following the fiscal year in which the deadline for using the aforementioned savings expires.
