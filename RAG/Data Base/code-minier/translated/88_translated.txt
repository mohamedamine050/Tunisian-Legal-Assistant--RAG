The Ministry responsible for mines may require the license holder to maintain a protective buffer zone to separate his mine from existing or potential neighboring mines or to protect public works or public or private facilities. The establishment of such a buffer zone may be imposed along national borders.

The license holder may not cross or remove this buffer zone except with prior permission from the Ministry responsible for mines.
