The renewal of a prospecting license shall take effect upon the expiration of its validity period. It shall be granted by a decision of the Minister in charge of Mines, based on the approval of the Mining Advisory Committee, and this decision shall be published in the Official Gazette of the Tunisian Republic.

If the request for renewal of the license is not decided upon before the expiration of its regular validity period, the license shall be extended implicitly, without further procedures, until the Minister in charge of Mines decides on it.

Prior to the issuance of this decision and starting from the date set for the expiration of the licenseâ€™s validity period, requests for prospecting licenses relating to the same area and the same group of mineral substances may be submitted. However, these requests shall not require registration but shall only be given a receipt upon deposit.

Upon approval of the renewal of the license, the submitted requests relating to the same area shall be returned to their owners.

In the event of refusal of the renewal, these requests shall be classified according to the order stipulated in Article 25 of this Code.
