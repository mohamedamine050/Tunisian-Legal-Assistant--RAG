## English Translation of the Arabic Legal Text:

**Exploration Licenses**

Exploration licenses are considered movable property and are not divisible. They are transferred upon death, subject to the mandatory notification of the Ministry of Mines of this transfer.

In cases of transfer upon death, the transfer of an exploration license to the heirs is not permissible unless it is established that the exploration works have been regularly continued and the heirs have committed themselves in writing to continue them and to appoint a representative to deal with the Ministry of Mines.

If the estate is without an heir, the exploration license automatically reverts to the state.  Exploration licenses cannot be transferred or authorized for exploitation, in whole or in part, except in favor of an entity that meets the conditions required for granting the license, and only after authorization from the Ministry of Mines.

Authorization is granted in the case of transfer or authorization stipulated in this article by law if the applicant proves that, during the validity periods of the license, they have carried out the minimum works specified in the granting decision.

In all cases, authorization is deemed granted if the Minister of Mines does not issue a decision within a period not exceeding two months from the date of filing the application.

The transfer between the transferor and the transferee must be in writing.

If an exploration license is granted to multiple partners, the withdrawal of one or more partners does not lead to the cancellation of the license if the remaining partners take over the rights and obligations of the withdrawing partner(s), provided that the granting authority is notified. In this case, the withdrawal is considered an abandonment. If the remaining partners exercise this option, the transfer includes the rights and obligations for the remaining period.

In the case of a total or partial transfer of an exploration license, the transferee assumes all obligations of the transferor and enjoys all the rights related to the whole or part transferred, arising from the provisions of this code and the regulatory texts adopted for its implementation, starting from the date of entry into force of the transfer.

No tax, duty, or fee of any nature, whether existing or subsequently created, is payable as a result of the total or partial transfer of the rights and obligations arising from the exploration license.

In the case of a total or partial transfer of the rights and obligations arising from the exploration license, the transferee can apply consumption according to the provisions of this code, under the heading of expenses incurred by the transferor that have not been settled or consumed.

In all cases, authorization for transfer is granted by a decision of the Minister of Mines, based on the approval of the Mining Advisory Committee. This decision is published in the Official Journal of the Tunisian Republic.
