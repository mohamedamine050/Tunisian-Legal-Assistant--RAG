The licensee shall be required to demarcate the perimeter of their license or exploitation concession upon the first request from the administration. In the event of their failure to do so, the Ministry responsible for mines may commission someone to carry out this demarcation at the licensee's expense.

In the event that exploration licenses and exploitation concessions, or either of them, are contiguous, the costs of demarcation shall be borne jointly by the licensees concerned. The landowners shall not be entitled to object to the demarcation operations, provided that they are compensated for any damages they may incur.
