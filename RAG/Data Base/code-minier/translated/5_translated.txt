## English Translation:

"Mines" are considered and classified into six groups, the deposits known to contain the following mineral substances:

**Group One:**

Solid fuels such as graphite, anthracite, coal, lignite, and other fossilized fuels.

**Group Two:**

Liquid and gaseous fuels such as tar, asphalt, petroleum, other liquid or gaseous fuels, helium, and other rare gases, and all liquid or gaseous sources that derive their energy from high or medium-power geothermal sources.

**Group Three:**

Metallic and semi-metallic substances such as iron, lead, zinc, copper, barium, fluorine, strontium, lily, sulfur, manganese, antimony, aluminum, gold, silver, tin, bismuth, cadmium, chromium, cobalt, magnesium, molybdenum, nickel, tungsten, arsenic, radioactive materials such as uranium, thorium, and other radioactive elements.

Precious stones such as diamonds and others.

**Group Four:**

Natural salts, whether solid, dissolved, or in the form of cohesive deposits or natural saline liquids, such as chlorides (including sea salt), bromides, iodides, borates, sulfates, nitrates, and other salts found in the same deposits.

**Group Five:**

Phosphate.

**Group Six:**

Rocks whose composition is dominated by a single mineral, and are primarily suitable for industrial applications other than those used in civil engineering.

The minimum qualitative limits for mineral substances belonging to Group Six are set by a joint decision of the Minister in charge of Mines and the Minister in charge of quarries, based on the opinion of the Advisory Committee for Mines.
