An application for an exploitation concession may only be accepted if it relates to an area containing the discovery that consists of a whole number of contiguous primary perimeters as defined in Section 23 of this Code.

However, an application for an exploitation concession whose perimeter is defined by an international boundary and therefore includes parts of primary perimeters may be accepted.
