If the occupation of land deprives its owners of the ability to dispose of it for a period exceeding three years, these owners may compel the license holder to purchase the concerned land in accordance with the prevailing legislation.

In all cases of land occupation, disagreements regarding the price, when the price agreed upon by the contracting parties exceeds or falls short of the selling price, shall be submitted to the courts, which shall issue immediately enforceable judgments, regardless of appeal.  Land may not be occupied until the aforementioned compensation is paid or secured by the public treasury of the Tunisian Republic.
