The establishment of an exploitation concession legally entails the cancellation of the exploration license from which the concession arose. However, this cancellation only applies to the initial areas contained wholly or partially within the requested exploitation concession. The other initial areas, whose validity period has not yet expired, remain in effect if applicable. 

The establishment of an exploitation concession cannot prejudice the acquired rights of license holders relating wholly or partially to the same areas and the same set of mineral substances.

If it is found after the establishment of an exploitation concession that its scope extends beyond areas subject to existing mining rights, the concerned parties may, at any time, request the Minister in charge of Mines to amend the boundaries of the exploitation concession.
