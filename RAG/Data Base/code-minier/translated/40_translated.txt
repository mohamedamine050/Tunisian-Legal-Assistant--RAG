The holder of a prospecting license may renounce all or part of their license at any time by means of a written declaration to this effect, provided that they have fulfilled their obligations with respect to the minimum works and expenses relating to the period of validity preceding their decision to renounce.

The Minister in charge of mines may cancel this license in whole or in part by a decision specifying the date on which new prospecting rights may be acquired for the renounced mineral deposits. This decision shall be published in the Official Gazette of the Tunisian Republic.

In the event of renunciation without valid reason, the license holder shall lose the right to obtain mining concessions for one year from the date of the lapse of the prospecting license.
