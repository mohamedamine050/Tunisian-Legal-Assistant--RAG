The holder of an exploitation concession may, upon necessity, be authorized by a decision of the Minister responsible for mines to use the roads, paths, tracks, railways, and equipment constructed by the holder of another concession or the operator of an adjacent, overlapping, or superimposed mine, or to use access points for the extraction of mineral materials, ventilation, or drainage, in return for the payment of compensation to the entitled parties.

If no amicable agreement is reached, such compensation shall be determined by an expert appointed by the competent court.
