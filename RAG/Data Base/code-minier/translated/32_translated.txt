The holder of a prospecting license has the right to renew their license twice consecutively, with each renewal period not exceeding three years.

This is subject to the following conditions:

a. That they have fulfilled their obligations, particularly those related to the minimum expenses and works required to be completed within the area covered by the license during the expired validity period.
b. That they have submitted an application for renewal of the prospecting license at least two months before the end of its validity period.
c. That they have undertaken to complete a minimum program of exploration work during the renewal period, the estimated cost of which they have also undertaken to provide as a minimum expenditure.
d. That they have demonstrated sufficient technical and financial capacity to complete the work mentioned in point c. of this section under optimal conditions.
e. That they have not committed violations that have caused serious environmental damage.

Upon the expiration of the second renewal period, if the licensee discovers a mineral deposit that warrants an exploitation concession, they are entitled to an exceptional renewal of the prospecting license for the purpose of evaluating the mineral deposit, conducting a technical and economic feasibility study, and developing the project if necessary. The renewal may cover the entire original area of the license or part thereof, as requested by the holder.

If the work program is completed only partially without a valid reason, the original area may be reduced upon renewal, based on the amount of expenses and work completed, taking into account the licensee's interests in the mining field.

The exploration expenses incurred within the perimeter of the prospecting license must be at least seventy-five percent of the actual completion of the necessary exploration work, such as geological, geophysical, and geochemical mapping, drilling, prospecting, underground work, geotechnical tests, and ore valuation tests.
