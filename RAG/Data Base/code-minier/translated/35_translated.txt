The Ministry responsible for mines may, upon the submission of an application for a prospecting license or its renewal, conduct a field inspection, which the applicant must attend. If the applicant, or his representative, fails to attend, the application will be considered rejected.

If, during this inspection, it is found that the application contains a defect, and if the applicant, within a period of one month from the date of his notification by registered letter with acknowledgement of receipt, fails to provide the required clarifications or make the necessary amendments to the drawings to bring them into compliance with the provisions of this section, the Minister responsible for mines shall, upon the approval of the Mining Advisory Committee, reject the application.

The applicant shall be notified of this rejection by registered letter with acknowledgement of receipt, within a period of two months from the expiry of the notification period. This rejection shall be recorded in a register with a voucher.
