In such cases, the purchase price is determined at double the commercial value if it is found after the completion of the works that the lands occupied have suffered significant damage or deterioration and are no longer suitable for their original use. The license holder shall either repair the damage or pay compensation to the landowner. This compensation cannot exceed double the commercial value of the affected lands at the time of occupation.

Disputes regarding the amount of compensation shall be brought before the courts.
