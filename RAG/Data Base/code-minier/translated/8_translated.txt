Mineral materials classified as "mines" are considered real estate. They are not subject to the provisions of the Real Estate Law governing registered properties, nor can they be mortgaged. The extracted mineral raw materials, as well as shares and interests in any company engaged in exploitation activities, are considered movable property.
