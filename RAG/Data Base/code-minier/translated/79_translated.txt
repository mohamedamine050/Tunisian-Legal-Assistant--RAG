No mining permit shall grant the right to occupy land for the purpose of exploration, prospecting, or exploitation of mines unless the owner's consent is obtained in writing.

However, if an amicable agreement is not reached, the licensee may be authorized to occupy the land necessary for the execution of mining exploration or exploitation activities pursuant to a decision by the Minister in charge of mines, after hearing the landowner. The licensee shall notify the landowner of the authorization decision through a bailiff, making the decision immediately enforceable.

However, the occupation of any plot located within an area enclosed by walls or similar structures requires the written consent of its owner.

The provisions of this section apply equally to land located both within and outside the perimeter of the exploitation concession.
