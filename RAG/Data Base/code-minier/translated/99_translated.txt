**To determine the profit:**

The profit, defined as the surplus exceeding the company's liabilities, is determined by including the company's capital in the debts incurred at the end of the fiscal year. This profit is subject to taxation.  The activities subject to profit tax are treated by the licensee independently from their other activities within the Tunisian Republic.

**For this purpose,** licensees are required to maintain accounts in Tunisia in accordance with the accounting legislation for businesses related to activities subject to profit tax.
