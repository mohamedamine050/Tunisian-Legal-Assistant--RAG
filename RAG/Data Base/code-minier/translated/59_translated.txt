The holder of the exploitation concession may not dispose of materials not authorized in the concession and extracted during mining operations except for the benefit of the mine and its dependencies.

The landowner may claim these unused materials from the exploiter if they are not classified as "mines," in exchange for fair compensation if necessary.

However, the exploiter may freely dispose of such materials resulting from the mechanical processing of mineral ores.
