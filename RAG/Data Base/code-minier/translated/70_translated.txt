The holder of the license is subject, with regard to the preservation and use of the water discovered during the course of his mining operations, to the legislation in force concerning the preservation and use of water belonging to the public domain, with the following exceptions:

1. The extraction of water accumulated within mines is not subject to the ordinary licensing regime provided for in the Water Code, but requires notification to the Ministry responsible for water, which may request the license holder to submit a license application within three months of the date of notification and oblige him, if necessary, to take the necessary measures to preserve the water table.

The aforementioned license may only be refused if the license holder refuses to take the necessary measures to ensure the preservation of the water table.

In no case shall the extraction of water accumulated within the mine result in the payment of royalties unless it is exploited for purposes other than those necessary for the needs of the mine and its dependencies.

2. The Ministry responsible for water must be notified if the water accumulated within the mine and extracted for the benefit of the mine, its dependencies, and its operation is used.  The request for a permit to exploit the water is not mandatory unless the Ministry responsible for water requests it within a maximum period of three months from the date of notification provided for in the first paragraph of point 2 of this article. This permit cannot be refused for the uses mentioned in the first paragraph of point 2 of this article unless there is a fear that it will cause irreparable damage to previous uses of the water or to uses that were planned at the time of notification.
