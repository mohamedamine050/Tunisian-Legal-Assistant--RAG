A holder of a mining exploration license whose term has expired or been revoked cannot, directly or indirectly, obtain any rights, even partial, within the area covered by this license until one year has elapsed from the date of the license's expiry or its revocation. However, these provisions do not apply if the renewal application was rejected due to non-submission within the deadlines set out in Article 32 of this Code and provided that the license is renewable under the provisions of the same Article.

The Minister in charge of Mines may, at the request of the license holder and upon approval of the Mining Advisory Committee, reduce the period stipulated in the first paragraph of this Article, provided that it is not less than six months.
