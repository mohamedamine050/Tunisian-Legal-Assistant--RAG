When the extraction or removal of a mineral substance within the scope of an exploitation concession results, without the possibility of avoidance, in the extraction or removal of another substance not belonging to the group of authorized mineral substances, the concession holder must submit an application for a prospecting license or exploitation concession encompassing the group to which the substance in question belongs. In this case, the applicant is legally entitled to obtain the requested prospecting license or exploitation concession.

However, if another exploitation concession holder with a valid concession requests the same substance under an exploitation concession previously obtained, the latter may be granted access to this substance in exchange for fair compensation.
