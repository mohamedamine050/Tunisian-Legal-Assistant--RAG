The right to explore, search for, or exploit a mine may only be acquired through a mining permit granted by the Minister responsible for mines. The exploration license and exploitation concession shall be granted for all mineral materials belonging to the same group. 

Multiple exploration licenses or exploitation concessions may be granted separately within the same boundaries, even if they are in favor of different applicants, as long as these licenses relate to different groups of mineral materials classified as "mines" within the meaning of this Code.
