Every person whose land has been occupied pursuant to Article 79 of this Code is entitled to receive compensation paid in advance. The amount of this compensation shall be determined in relation to the period of occupation, based on an annual sum equivalent to twice the rental value of the occupied land at the time of its occupation, unless an agreement is reached by mutual consent in this regard.

Courts shall consider objections regarding the amount of this compensation, and their judgments shall be immediately enforceable notwithstanding any appeal. Occupation shall not take place unless compensation has been paid or secured in the public treasury of the Tunisian Republic. Furthermore, the holder of the permit shall be obliged to compensate for any damage that his activities may cause to the property.
