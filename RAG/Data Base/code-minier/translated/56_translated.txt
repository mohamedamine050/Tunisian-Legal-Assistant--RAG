By virtue of a decision taken by the Minister in charge of Mines, based on the approval of the Mining Advisory Committee and at the request of the concerned license holders, it is possible at any time to merge several contiguous exploitation concessions into a single exploitation concession concerning the same set of mineral materials classified as "mines".

This merger may be declared in the same document as the one establishing one of the contiguous exploitation concessions.
