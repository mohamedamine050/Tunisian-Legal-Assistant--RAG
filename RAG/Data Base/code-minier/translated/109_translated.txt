The licensee may be a resident or a non-resident.

A licensee operating within a company subject to Tunisian law shall be considered a non-resident when the company's capital is owned by non-resident Tunisians or foreigners and is constituted through the supply of convertible foreign currency to at least sixty-six percent of the capital. Residents' contributions to the capital of a non-resident licensee's company are subject to the prevailing exchange regulations.

Establishments set up in Tunisia by legal entities with their registered office abroad shall be considered non-residents for exchange purposes. The credits allocated to these establishments must be funded by the registered office through the inflow of convertible foreign currency.
