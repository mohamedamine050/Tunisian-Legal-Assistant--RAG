If the holder of a mining concession exploits the mine in a manner that is not in accordance with the obligations undertaken pursuant to Articles 44 and 61 of this Code, and without a legitimate excuse, they may be served with a notice to resume operations or to fulfill their obligations within a period not exceeding six months, after being heard.

The phrase "legitimate excuse" for the suspension of exploitation refers to the temporary impossibility, duly recognized, of continuing exploitation under economically viable conditions.

The notice is to be served by the Ministry in charge of mines upon the holder of the concession or their representative, by registered mail with acknowledgment of receipt. During the notice period, the granting authority has the right to pursue the exploitation of the mine directly or through a third party.

However, the mining concession shall be revoked in accordance with the procedures laid down in Article 65 of this Code if the holder of the concession does not resume operations within the time limits stipulated in the first paragraph of this article.
