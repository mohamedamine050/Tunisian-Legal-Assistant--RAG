National decorations are awarded to Tunisian and foreign nationals for life, and may be awarded posthumously. 

National decorations are the property of the holder for life and are not inheritable.

The holder shall not be deprived of the decoration except in cases where he loses his civil rights and political rights, in accordance with the Electoral Code, or pursuant to a written judgment issued in this regard by competent courts.

For this purpose, the courts must submit to the Presidency of the Republic a list containing the names of those convicted who are holders of national decorations.
