The Grand Collar of the Grand Marshal is crafted from unalloyed gold and comprises thirteen decorations. These decorations feature the Republic's emblem and are interconnected by rings in the shape of olive branches and wheat ears, all adorned with diamonds. 

Each decoration is coated with red enamel. 

The central decoration, situated above the central medallion, is embellished with a crescent moon and star, both set with diamonds.

The central medallion itself is identical to the medal of the second class, except for the following distinctions:

- It is slightly larger in size.
- Its edges are inlaid with diamonds.

On the reverse side, the names of the Grand Marshals who have received the award are inscribed, along with the dates of their tenure and, where applicable, the date of its termination.

The Grand Collar of the Grand Marshal is worn with the Grand Medal and the Grand Sash, with the medal of the second class suspended below.

The collar designated for the Grand Marshal is gilded and identical in form to the Grand Collar of the Order, except that the central medallion is not set with diamonds.
