The Grand Cross medal is a slightly curved silver-gilt plaque worn on the left side of the chest, measuring 80 millimeters in diameter. The plaque is composed of a seven-pointed star plated with blue enamel and with gilt edges.  On the gilt plaque are:

- Seven gilt five-pointed leaves, interspersed between the points of the plaque.

- Seven smaller gilt five-pointed leaves, interspersed between the first set of leaves.

At the center of the plaque is a gilt disc, rising above the leaves, bearing a raised image of the emblem of the Republic, surrounded by a raised laurel wreath.

Above the disc is inscribed “The Tunisian Republic” and below it “National Order of Merit”. The Grand Cross includes a larger silk sash measuring 101 millimeters wide, worn on the right shoulder.  Two gilt lines run along the edge of this blue sash.

For women, the Grand Cross plaque is identical to the men’s Grand Cross plaque, but its diameter is 65 millimeters. The Second Class medal is worn with a larger sash measuring 80 millimeters wide.
