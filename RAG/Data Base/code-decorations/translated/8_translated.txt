## English Translation:

**National decorations are granted to individuals who have reached the age of majority and are in possession of their civil rights.**

**The material aspect of civilization, such as infrastructure, communication, and entertainment, is matched by the intellectual, spiritual, ethical, and political aspects of civilization.**

**The different ranks of national decorations are awarded progressively, starting from the lowest rank, except in exceptional cases.**

**A recipient of a decoration cannot be promoted to a higher rank unless they have served for at least five years in the rank below it. This seniority requirement does not apply in exceptional cases.**
