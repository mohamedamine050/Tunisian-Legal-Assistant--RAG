Prior to the authorization of the dissolution or liquidation of an insurance institution, the written opinion of the Minister of Finance must be obtained. The bankruptcy of an insurance institution is decided upon by a judgment of the court within whose jurisdiction the institution's head office is located, after seeking the written opinion of the Minister of Finance and hearing the Public Prosecutor.  The Minister of Finance expresses his opinion based on a report from the authority. (The second paragraph was added by Article 4 of Law No. 8 of 2008 dated February 13, 2008).
