The purchase of the contract in the case of insurance is as follows:

**Insurance Contract**

The contract is a legally binding agreement that obligates the contracting parties and defines their obligations and rights with respect to the specific transaction. 

Under this contract, the insurer undertakes to pay the insured or the beneficiary a sum of money, a regular income, or any other financial compensation in the event of the occurrence of the insured event, in exchange for premiums or any other financial payment made by the insured to the insurer.

Life insurance is mandatory upon request by the contracting party. Term insurance, in the event of death, does not entitle the beneficiary to a reduction of the principal or the purchase of the contract.
