The subject matter upon which the speaker or writer builds their discourse is the **contract of insurance**.

A **contract** is a legally binding agreement that obligates the contracting parties and defines their obligations and rights with respect to the specific transaction.

Through this contract, the insurer undertakes to pay the insured or the beneficiary a sum of money, a regular income, or any other financial compensation in the event of the occurrence of the insured event, in exchange for premiums or other financial payments made by the insured to the insurer. 

Any lawful interest may be insured, both directly and indirectly, against the non-occurrence of a risk, except for those explicitly and specifically excluded. The insurer is not liable for the consequences of intentional acts, nor for the consequences of acts committed based on fraud.
