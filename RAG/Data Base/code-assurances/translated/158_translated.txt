In the event that the insurer submits a settlement offer that does not conform to the standards set forth in Articles 121 to 147 of this Code, the amount awarded by the court shall accrue interest at a rate of one and a half times the legal civil interest rate, calculated from the date of submission of the settlement offer to the date of the final judgment, unless it has been executed before that date.
