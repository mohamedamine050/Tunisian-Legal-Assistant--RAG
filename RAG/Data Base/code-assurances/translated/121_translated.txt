Compensation for damages resulting from traffic accidents, as stipulated in Article 126 of this Code, shall be paid to the victims or their successors-in-interest in the event of death, in the case of amicable settlement, in accordance with the rules and standards provided for in this chapter.

The same standards shall apply before the courts, and the judge may increase or reduce the amount of compensation by a percentage not exceeding fifteen percent for each individual damage, in accordance with the circumstances. No other law may be invoked against the insurer in the claim for compensation for personal injury in traffic accidents. With regard to traffic accidents that are considered occupational in nature, the victim or their successors-in-interest, as the case may be, shall be entitled to receive only the difference between the compensation under this Code and the compensation for damages arising from accidents that are considered occupational in nature. The provisions of this chapter shall not apply to material damage caused to motorized land vehicles. Such damages shall be compensated in proportion to the liability not borne by the driver, whether the vehicle is owned by him or by another.
