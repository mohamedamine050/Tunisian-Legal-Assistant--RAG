The insurance sector professions are subject to the supervision of the "General Insurance Authority". This supervision aims to protect the insured and beneficiaries of insurance contracts from all parties involved in the proper execution of these contracts.

This supervision specifically includes the application of regulations related to insurance and the management of insurance institutions and reinsurance institutions, as well as the use of funds related to insurance and reinsurance operations.

**Note:** The text you provided defines a contract as a legally binding agreement, then repeats this definition several times. This repetition, along with the somewhat disjointed nature of the text, suggests it might be a part of a larger document.
