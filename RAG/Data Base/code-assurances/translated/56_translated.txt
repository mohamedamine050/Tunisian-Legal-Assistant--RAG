The organization, management, and governance structures of insurance companies are governed by a contract in which the insurer undertakes to pay the insured or the beneficiary a sum of money, a periodic payment, or any other financial compensation in the event of the occurrence of the insured risk, in exchange for premiums or other financial payments made by the insured to the insurer. These structures are characterized by their cooperative nature and are regulated by their basic regulations, which are standardized by model regulations that have binding effect. The provisions of Chapter 223 and Chapters 258 to 273 of the Commercial Companies Code apply to these companies.
