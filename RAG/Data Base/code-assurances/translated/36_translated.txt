The insurance contract is a legally binding agreement that obligates the contracting parties and defines their respective obligations and rights regarding the specific transaction. 

Through this contract, the insurer undertakes to pay the insured or the beneficiary a sum of money, a periodic income, or any other financial compensation in the event of the occurrence of the insured event, in exchange for premiums or any other financial payment made by the insured to the insurer.

A life insurance contract entered into by a third party on the life of the insured shall be void unless the latter gives his written consent prior to the underwriting of the contract. The insured's consent is required in the event of a mortgage or the transfer of the benefit of the insurance.
