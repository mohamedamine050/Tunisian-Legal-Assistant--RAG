The provisions of the Insurance Code and its implementing texts that do not conflict with the provisions of this chapter apply to the operations and institutions of insurance.  An insurance contract is one in which the insurer undertakes to pay the insured or the beneficiary a sum of money, a periodic income, or any other financial compensation in the event of the occurrence of the insured event, in consideration of premiums or any other financial payment made by the insured to the insurer.  This also applies to Takaful insurance; an insurance contract whereby the insurer undertakes to pay the insured or the beneficiary a sum of money, a periodic income, or any other financial compensation in the event of the occurrence of the insured event, in consideration of premiums or any other financial payment made by the insured to the insurer.
