The insured is not entitled to file a claim seeking the recovery of insurance premiums. 

An insurance contract is a binding legal agreement that obligates the contracting parties and defines their obligations and rights in relation to the specific transaction. Under this contract, the insurer undertakes to pay the insured or the beneficiary a sum of money, a periodic income, or any other financial compensation in the event of the occurrence of the insured event, in return for premiums or any other financial payment made by the insured to the insurer. 

Failure to pay an installment of premiums does not result in the termination of the insurance contract, nor does it lead to a reduction of its effect. Failure to pay premiums for life insurance contracts, whether these contracts are concluded for the insured's entire lifetime without any condition relating to survival or if they stipulate that the insured sums or benefits are payable after a certain number of years, does not result in a reduction of the insured capital or benefit, notwithstanding any contrary agreement, provided that at least three annual premiums have been paid.
