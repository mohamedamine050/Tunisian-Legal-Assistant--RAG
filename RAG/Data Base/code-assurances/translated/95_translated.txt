The owner of the establishment must secure [liability insurance] for all the intervening parties referred to in the first chapter of the law concerning liability and technical oversight in the field of construction pursuant to the [contract]. The [contract] is a legally binding agreement that obligates the contracting parties and defines their obligations and rights with respect to the particular transaction. A single [insurance] policy for each site must be concluded before its opening with an insurance company. The owner of the establishment deducts the share of the [insurance] premium from the wage of each intervening party on the site. 

By virtue of the [contract], the insurer undertakes to pay the insured or the beneficiary a sum of money, a periodic income, or any other financial compensation in the event of the occurrence of the insured event in exchange for premiums or any other financial payment made by the insured to the insurer. After receiving a copy of the [insurance] contract, the mayor or governor, as the case may be, shall verify that the owner of the establishment has concluded a [liability insurance] contract for all intervening parties in the construction before the site is opened. In all cases, the Minister in charge of urban planning can verify that the owner of the establishment has concluded an [insurance] contract as stipulated in this chapter. The owner of the establishment must provide the aforementioned authorities with a copy of the [insurance] contract during the verification process. (The third, fourth, and fifth paragraphs were added pursuant to Chapter Three of Law No. 37 of 2002 dated April 1, 2002).
