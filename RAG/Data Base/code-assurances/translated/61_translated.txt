Auditors of insurance companies and reinsurance companies are required to, regardless of their legal obligations, 1) immediately inform the General Insurance Authority (1) of any action that may constitute a risk to the interests of the institution or the beneficiaries of insurance contracts; 2) deliver to the General Insurance Authority (1) within six months following the end of each fiscal year a report on the audit they have performed, this report to be prepared in accordance with the conditions (1) and procedures specified by the Minister of Finance, (1) as allocated; 3) send a copy of their report to the General Insurance Authority, to the general assembly, and to the bodies of the institution under their audit. 

Any action taken against an auditor (1) and which contravenes the obligations incumbent upon him as set out in paragraphs (1) and (2) above may result in a decision by the Minister of Finance, on the proposal of the Authority, to prohibit him from practicing his activity with insurance companies and reinsurance companies for a temporary period not exceeding three years or permanently. (The last paragraph was repealed by Article 7 of Law No. 8 of 2008, dated February 13, 2008).
