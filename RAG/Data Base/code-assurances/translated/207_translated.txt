The Sharia Supervisory Board may request from the institution the documents and explanations it deems necessary to perform its duties. All decisions issued by it are binding on the insurance institution.

An insurance contract is one whereby the insurer undertakes to pay the insured or the beneficiary a sum of money, a periodic income, or any other financial compensation in the event of the occurrence of the insured event, in return for premiums or any other financial payment made by the insured to the insurer.

The Sharia Supervisory Board shall prepare an annual report on the results of its work, which shall be addressed to the Board of Directors or its collective management body of the institution, and a copy thereof shall be forwarded to the General Insurance Authority by no later than July 31st of each year.  The conditions to be met by the members of the Sharia Supervisory Board, the tasks entrusted to it, and its management procedures shall be determined by a joint decision of the Ministers of Finance and Religious Affairs.
