An insurance undertaking may only entrust Takaful insurance operations to reinsurance institutions engaged in insurance activities.  Insurance is a contract whereby the insurer undertakes to pay the insured or the beneficiary a sum of money, a regular income, or any other financial compensation in the event of the occurrence of the insured event, in consideration of premiums or any other financial payment made by the insured to the insurer.  In the event that there is insufficient capacity among reinsurance companies engaged in insurance activities, or in the absence of coverage for the risk to be reinsured, the Takaful insurance undertaking may deal with traditional reinsurance institutions, provided that the percentage of entrustment is reduced to the minimum possible extent and that the agreement with these institutions is for the shortest possible period, following approval from the Sharia Supervisory Authority.
