The insurer obligated to submit a settlement offer shall request from the National Social Security Fund (Caisse Nationale de Sécurité Sociale) a list of amounts paid or due to the injured party, or to those who inherit their rights upon death, as compensation for damages suffered in work-related traffic accidents.  He shall also request from the lessor a list of amounts due for services rendered to the injured party. Failure to submit the list referred to in the preceding paragraph within a maximum period of forty-five days from the date of the request shall result in the forfeiture of the right of the Fund or the lessor to recover those amounts from the insurer and the party responsible for the accident.
