Any service provider who is qualified to investigate the causes, nature, extent, and assessment of damages shall be considered an expert. The expert's role is primarily limited to the technical aspects. Any service provider who is qualified to examine damages, losses, and deterioration of insured goods, to pursue claims against third parties responsible for such damages, and to take precautionary and preventative measures to prevent further damage shall be considered a damage inspector. "Experts and damage inspectors may not practice their activities unless they have signed (2) a specifications booklet approved by a decision of the Minister of Finance, upon the recommendation of the Professional Association of Insurance Institutions, and have been registered in a register kept by the Professional Association of Insurance Institutions.  Furthermore, it is not permissible to combine the duties of expert and damage inspector." (Repealed and replaced by Article 5 of Law No. 91 of 2001, dated August 7, 2001).
