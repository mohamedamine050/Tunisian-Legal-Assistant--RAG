Every natural person or legal entity capable of bearing civil liability arising from the use of a motorized land vehicle and its trailers for circulation must conclude a contract of insurance guaranteeing the liability that may be incurred due to damage caused by the vehicle to persons and property. Each trailer must be insured separately, whether it is attached to the towing vehicle or not, and the trailer shall be considered as a vehicle for the purposes of this provision. The insurance contract obligates the insurer to pay the insured or the beneficiary a sum of money, a regular income, or any other financial compensation in the event of the occurrence of the insured event, in return for premiums or any other financial payment made by the insured to the insurer. This obligation applies to the person who concluded the contract, the owner of the vehicle, and any person entrusted with its custody or driving, with the exception of persons engaged in the profession of repairing, maintaining, or trading vehicles.  The owners of the professions referred to in the preceding paragraph of this chapter must insure their civil liability, as well as the liability of their agents and any person driving or holding the vehicles entrusted to them within the scope of their work. This obligation is not subject to any form of appeal.
