The injured party, or those to whom the right accrues upon death, may, within a maximum period of one month from the date of receipt of the investigative report, request an amicable settlement by registered mail with acknowledgment of receipt or by any other means that leaves a written trace.

In the event of the death of the injured party after submitting a request for amicable settlement or after initiating legal proceedings, those to whom the right accrues upon death shall be granted a period of one month from the date of death to submit a request for amicable settlement. In these cases, the insurer guaranteeing civil liability arising from the use of a motorized land vehicle must submit an amicable settlement offer for compensation for damage to persons in road traffic accidents, within a maximum period of six months from the date of the request for amicable settlement. If the injured party, or those to whom the right accrues upon death, initiates legal proceedings and then abandons them to request amicable settlement, the insurance company may refuse or accept the amicable settlement.
