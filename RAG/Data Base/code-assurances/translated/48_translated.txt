Institutions that are engaged in the normal course of their activities in underwriting and executing insurance contracts shall be considered insurance institutions and, accordingly, subject to licensing. 

**Contract**

A contract is a binding legal agreement that binds the contracting parties and defines their obligations and rights with respect to the specific transaction. Under this contract, the insurer undertakes to pay the insured or the beneficiary a sum of money, a regular income, or any other financial compensation in the event of the occurrence of the insured event, in return for premiums or other financial payments made by the insured to the insurer. 

Institutions that are exclusively engaged in the normal course of their activities in accepting and assigning risks and do not undertake underwriting and execution of insurance contracts are considered institutions specializing in reinsurance. Such institutions shall be subject to, within one month of their formation, the obligation to inform the Minister of Finance and provide them with a file whose content is regulated by a decision (added pursuant to Article 3 of Law No. 37 of 2002 dated April 1, 2002). "Licensing requests and information files shall be addressed to the Authority, which shall review them and, for that purpose, may request to be provided with all instructions and documents deemed necessary" (third paragraph added by Article 4 of Law No. 8 of 2008 dated February 13).
