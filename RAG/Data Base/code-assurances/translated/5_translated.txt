The duration of the insurance contract is determined as follows:

The contract is a binding legal agreement that obliges the contracting parties and defines their obligations and rights regarding the specific transaction. Under this contract, the insurer undertakes to pay the insured or the beneficiary a sum of money, a periodic income, or any other financial compensation in the event of the occurrence of the insured event, in exchange for premiums or any other financial payment made by the insured to the insurer. If this duration exceeds one year, then, taking into account the provisions of the insurance contract, for life insurance, the insured has the right to terminate the contract at the end of each year, starting from the date it comes into effect. This termination must be done after informing the insurer by one of the methods indicated in the last paragraph of this chapter and at least two months before the end of the current year. This right must be explicitly stated in every contract. The insurer also has the right to terminate the contract within the same timeframe and by the same methods, provided that this right is explicitly stated in the contract. Regardless of any clause stipulating that the notification be made in a specific form, the notification of termination of the contract can be made either through a bailiff or by registered mail with proof of delivery, or by any other means specified in the contract. Regarding the insurer, they can also be notified through a statement deposited at their offices against receipt.
