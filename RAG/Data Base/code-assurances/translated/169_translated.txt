When requesting amicable settlement, the injured party, or those who inherit their rights upon death, must provide the insurer with the data requested to prepare an amicable settlement offer within a period not exceeding one month from the date of receipt of a registered letter with acknowledgment of receipt or any other means leaving a written trace.  This data includes the identity, profession, and income of the injured party, the damages suffered, and the identification of entities claiming compensation on their behalf, accompanied by supporting documents. In case of death, the data shall include the identity of the heirs, their degree of kinship with the deceased, the birth certificate of each heir, the death certificate of the deceased or proof of death, and the identification of entities claiming compensation on their behalf, accompanied by supporting documents. This data shall be recorded according to a form prepared by the professional association of insurance companies, approved by the Minister of Finance.  In the event of a dispute between the insurer and the injured party, or their heirs, concerning this data and supporting documents, an urgent case may be brought to examine its completeness.
