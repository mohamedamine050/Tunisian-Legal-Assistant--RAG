The insurer of fire shall bear the compensation for damages sustained by the insured objects resulting from explosion, ignition, or combustion. However, the insurer shall not bear the damages resulting solely from heat or from direct and immediate contact with fire if there is no fire or beginning of fire, unless otherwise agreed upon.
