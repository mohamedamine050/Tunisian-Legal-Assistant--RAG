Insurance institutions, whether primary or reinsurance institutions, are obligated to enter into contracts wherein the insurer undertakes to pay the insured or the beneficiary a sum of money, a periodic income, or any other financial compensation in the event of the occurrence of the insured event. This obligation is in exchange for premiums or any other financial payment made by the insured to the insurer.

These institutions are required to submit the following to the General Insurance Authority within the specified deadlines:

- Circumstantial follow-up documents and tables, every three months.
- An annual report on all their operations, including statistical tables and accompanying data.

This must be submitted no later than July 31st of each year. The list and forms of circumstantial follow-up documents and tables, as well as the statistical tables and accompanying data included in the annual report, shall be determined by the Authority.

In addition to the above, these institutions must publish their balance sheets, statement of technical results, statement of results, cash flow statement, and the auditor's report annually in the Official Gazette of the Tunisian Republic and in at least two daily newspapers published in Tunisia, one of which must be in Arabic. In the event of the institution's failure to perform this procedure, publication may be undertaken by the General Insurance Authority at the expense of the institution concerned.
