Insurance institutions may, with the approval of the Minister of Finance, transfer their entire portfolio of contracts or a part thereof, including all rights and obligations, to one insurance institution or to several licensed insurance institutions.

The merger or absorption of insurance institutions is subject to the same procedure. The Minister of Finance grants his approval based on a report by the competent authority informing the relevant parties. (The third paragraph was added by Article 4 of Law No. 8 of 2008 dated February 13, 2008).
