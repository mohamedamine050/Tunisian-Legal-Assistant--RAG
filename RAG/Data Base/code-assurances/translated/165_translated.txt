If the insurer refuses to pay the advance or provides it late, or offers an amount less than that stipulated in Article 164 of this Code, the aggrieved party may file an urgent action. The insurer shall bear late payment interest equal to one and a half times the legal civil interest rate, commencing from the expiration of fifteen days until the issuance of the final and binding judgment, unless executed beforehand.
