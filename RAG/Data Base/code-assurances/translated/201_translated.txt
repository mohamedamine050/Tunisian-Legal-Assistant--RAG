Takaful insurance is a contractual system whereby a group of persons, called "subscribers," undertake to cooperate in the event of the occurrence of the risk or the arrival of the term specified in the Takaful insurance contract, by paying a sum of money by way of donation, called "subscription fee." The total of the subscription fees constitutes the "subscribers' fund," which is allocated to the payment of compensations and is completely separate from the accounts of the insurance institution.

The contract is a binding legal agreement that obligates the contracting parties and defines their obligations and rights with respect to the specific transaction.  Thereby, the insurer undertakes to pay the insured or the beneficiary a sum of money, a regular income, or any other financial compensation in the event of the occurrence of the insured event, in exchange for premiums or any other financial payment made by the insured to the Takaful insurer. The Takaful insurance institution manages the subscribers' fund and invests the accumulated funds in return for a specific commission, in accordance with Sharia standards.
