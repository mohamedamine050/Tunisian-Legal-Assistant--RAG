The insurer may oppose the victims of traffic accidents, or those who succeed to their rights in the event of death, in the following cases: 

**A.**  **In cases of lack of insurance:**

* **Invalidity of the insurance contract:**  A contract is a legally binding agreement that obliges the contracting parties and defines their obligations and rights regarding the specific transaction. 
* **Expiration of the insurance contract:** A contract is a legally binding agreement that obliges the contracting parties and defines their obligations and rights regarding the specific transaction. 
* **Termination of the insurance contract:** A contract is a legally binding agreement that obliges the contracting parties and defines their obligations and rights regarding the specific transaction. 
* **Rescission of the insurance contract:** A contract is a legally binding agreement that obliges the contracting parties and defines their obligations and rights regarding the specific transaction. 
    * Except in the case specified in the last paragraph of Article 11 of this code.
* **Suspension of the insurance contract:** A contract is a legally binding agreement that obliges the contracting parties and defines their obligations and rights regarding the specific transaction. 
    * Except in the cases specified respectively in the last paragraph of Article 11 and the third paragraph of Article 22 of this code.

**B.**  **In all cases of exclusion from coverage as stipulated in Article 118 of this code.**

The insurer who wishes to rely on the lack of insurance or on cases of exclusion from coverage, in order not to lose their rights, must notify the Traffic Accident Victims Guarantee Fund within twenty-one days from the date of receiving the investigative report, and request their intervention. They must also inform the victim, or those who succeed to their rights in the event of death, within the same time limit and in the same manner as specified in the preceding paragraph.  The Fund will then pay the compensation to the rightful beneficiaries and can bring a lawsuit to recover the amount paid.
