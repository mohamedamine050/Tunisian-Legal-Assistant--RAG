Insurance assistance consists of an undertaking, in exchange for the advance payment of the insurance premium, by which the insurer undertakes to pay the insured or the beneficiary a sum of money, a regular income, or any other financial compensation in the event of the occurrence of the insured event, in exchange for premiums or any other financial payment made by the insured to the insurer. 

The contract is a legally binding agreement that obligates the contracting parties and defines their obligations and rights with respect to the specific transaction.

It also entails the undertaking to provide immediate assistance to the beneficiary of the contract when the latter faces difficulties arising from an unforeseen event, in the cases and according to the conditions specified in the contract. Regardless of the provisions of the first chapter of this Code, the assistance can take the form of in-kind services.
