An insurance contract may stipulate that the contract is a binding legal agreement that obligates the contracting parties and defines their obligations and rights with respect to the specific transaction. 

Under this contract, the insurer undertakes to pay the insured or the beneficiary a sum of money, a regular income, or any other financial compensation in the event of the occurrence of the insured risk. This is in exchange for premiums or any other financial payment made by the insured to the insurer.

The insured shall retain a specified portion of the damage. The portion retained by the insured refers to the percentage or amount corresponding to the part of the damage not covered by the insurance and borne by the intervener in the construction within the framework of the ten-year liability referred to in the first chapter of the law relating to liability and technical supervision in the field of construction.

The insurer shall not be entitled to oppose the beneficiaries of the insurance with regard to the portion retained by the insured. However, the insurer who has paid compensation, within the limits of this portion, shall have the right to seek recourse against the intervener in the construction whose liability for the damage has been established, to recover the sums paid.
