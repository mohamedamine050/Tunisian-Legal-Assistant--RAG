Any person who violates the provisions of Article 110 of this Code shall be punished by a fine of one hundred to one thousand dinars and imprisonment from sixteen days to three months, or by one of these penalties. In case of recidivism, the amount of the fine shall be doubled. 

However, if a case is brought before the Civil Court concerning the existence of insurance, or its validity, the Criminal Court dealing with the misdemeanor mentioned above must suspend its proceedings until the civil dispute is resolved by a final judgment.
