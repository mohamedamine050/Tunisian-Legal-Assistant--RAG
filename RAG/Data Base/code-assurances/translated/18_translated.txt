Any person who has insurance with multiple insurers for the same interest and against the same risk shall immediately inform each insurer of the other insurers. When informing the insurer, the insured shall specify the name of the other insurer with whom they have contracted insurance and the amount insured. If multiple insurance contracts are entered into without fraud, whether on the same date or on different dates, for a total amount exceeding the value of the insured object, they shall all be in effect in proportion to the share of each contract in the total amount, provided that the total amount of compensation does not exceed the value of the insured object. It is possible to agree in the contract to adopt a rule based on the order of dates or to stipulate solidarity between the insurers.
