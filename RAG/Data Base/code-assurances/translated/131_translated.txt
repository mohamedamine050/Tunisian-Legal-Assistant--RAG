Permanent disability is the final deficiency in the injured party's functional capacity after complete recovery, in comparison with their functional capacity immediately before the accident. The percentage of permanent disability is determined by a medical examination based on a standardized table set by a joint decision of the Minister of Finance and the Minister in charge of Public Health.
