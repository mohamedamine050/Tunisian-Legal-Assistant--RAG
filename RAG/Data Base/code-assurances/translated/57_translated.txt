The common fund of insurance companies shall not be less than one million and five hundred thousand dinars. This fund shall be constituted from the membership contributions paid by the subscribers upon their initial membership, as well as loans, grants, donations, and gifts received by the company.

**Note:** The Arabic text refers to "insurance" twice. I have removed the repetition in the English translation for clarity.
