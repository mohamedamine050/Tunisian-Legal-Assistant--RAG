The insurance contract remains in force. The insurance contract is a legally binding agreement that obligates the contracting parties and defines their obligations and rights with respect to the specific transaction. By virtue of this contract, the insurer undertakes to pay the insured or the beneficiary a sum of money, a periodic income, or any other financial compensation in the event of the occurrence of the insured event, in return for premiums or other financial payments made by the insured to the insurer. The insurance contract remains in force compulsorily in the event of the death of the insured or the transfer of the insured object to the heir, purchaser, or successor in interest, provided that the heir, purchaser, or successor in interest undertakes to perform the obligations of the insured towards the insurer under the insurance contract. However, the insurance contract terminates compulsorily in the event of the transfer of a motorized vehicle after ten days from the date of transfer. Either party may terminate the contract, and if termination is not effected by either party or if the contract is not executed by mutual agreement of the insurer and the transferee, then termination shall take place compulsorily at the end of a period of two months from the date of transfer. In motor vehicle liability insurance, the insurer may not oppose the termination of the contract referred to in the second paragraph of this section by victims of accidents or their successors in interest. The insured must notify the insurer of the transfer by registered mail.
