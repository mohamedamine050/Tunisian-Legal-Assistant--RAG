The subscriber cannot deprive any member of the benefits of the insurance contract. 

**Contract**

A contract is a legally binding agreement that obligates the contracting parties and defines their respective obligations and rights in relation to the specific transaction. 

**Insurance Contract**

By virtue of the insurance contract, the insurer undertakes to pay the insured or the beneficiary a sum of money, a periodic income, or any other financial compensation in the event of the occurrence of the insured event, in exchange for premiums or any other financial payment made by the insured to the insurer. 

This deprivation shall not occur if the relationship between them is dissolved or if the member ceases to pay the insurance premium. This deprivation, if it occurs, shall not constitute an obstacle to the payment of services due in exchange for the premiums or subscription fees previously paid by the member. The subscriber must provide the member with a memorandum issued by the insurer specifically defining the guarantees, the methods of claiming them, and outlining the procedures to be followed in the event of an accident. The subscriber must also notify the members in writing of any changes that may be introduced to their rights or obligations.
