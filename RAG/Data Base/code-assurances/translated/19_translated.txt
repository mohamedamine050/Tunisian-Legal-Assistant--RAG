An insurance contract is a binding legal agreement that obligates the contracting parties and defines their obligations and rights in relation to the specific transaction. 

By this contract, the insurer undertakes to pay the insured or the beneficiary a sum of money, a regular income, or any other financial compensation in the event of the occurrence of the insured event, in return for premiums or any other financial payment made by the insured to the insurer.

The contract shall be null and void if the insured object is non-existent or not exposed to risk at the time of the contract. 

The insurance contract shall automatically terminate in the event of total damage or complete loss of the insured object resulting from an event not covered by the contract. In the cases mentioned in the preceding paragraphs, the insurer shall be required to reimburse the insured for the premium or a portion of the premium paid in advance, in proportion to the period during which the insured risk did not occur.
