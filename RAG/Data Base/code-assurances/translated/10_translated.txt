The insured is obligated, upon the occurrence of the risk or the arrival of the contract's due date, to pay the agreed-upon compensation or the amount stipulated in the contract within the specified period. The insured cannot be required to pay an amount exceeding the insured amount.  Unpaid amounts shall accrue interest at the legal interest rate, according to applicable legal provisions, from the date on which such amounts became due until their full payment. The insurer remains solely responsible towards the insured in all cases where they have reinsured the risk.
