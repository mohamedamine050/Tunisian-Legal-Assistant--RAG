In the event of death, insurance shall have no effect if the insured intentionally commits suicide. However, the insurer shall pay to those who inherit the rights an amount equal to the insurance reserve. In the case of the insured committing suicide while unconscious, the insurer is obligated to pay the amounts stipulated in the contract. The burden of proof for suicide lies with the insurer, while the burden of proof for the lack of consciousness lies with the beneficiary.
