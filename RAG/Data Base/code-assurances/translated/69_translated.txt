The insurance contract is a binding legal agreement that obligates the contracting parties and defines their obligations and rights regarding the specific transaction. 
By this contract, the insurer undertakes to pay the insured or the beneficiary a sum of money, a regular income, or any other financial compensation in the event of the occurrence of the insured event, in exchange for premiums or any other financial payment made by the insured to the insurer.
