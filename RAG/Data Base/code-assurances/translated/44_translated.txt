Risks occurring in Tunisia and to persons residing therein cannot be insured by contracts subscribed with insurance institutions that do not have the status of resident institutions. Authorization may be granted exceptionally in (1). However, "the Minister of Finance, upon the proposal of the Authority," may subscribe insurance contracts outside Tunisia to cover the consequences of professional liability of the maritime carrier and the maritime equipment supplier. (Paragraph 2 was added by Article 3 of Law No. 37 of 2002 dated April 1, 2002).
