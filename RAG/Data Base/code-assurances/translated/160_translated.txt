Subject to the provisions of Article 10 of this Code, the insurer obligated to submit a settlement offer must pay the compensation amount within a maximum period of thirty days from the date of signing the settlement agreement. Upon expiry of this period, the settlement agreement, signed between the insurer and the injured party or their heir(s) upon death, shall be rendered enforceable by the President of the Court of First Instance in whose jurisdiction the insurer or the injured party resides.  If the insurer fails to respect the deadline stipulated in the first paragraph of this Article, the compensation amount shall accrue interest calculated at one and a half times the statutory civil interest rate from the expiry of the execution deadline until the fulfillment of its obligations.
