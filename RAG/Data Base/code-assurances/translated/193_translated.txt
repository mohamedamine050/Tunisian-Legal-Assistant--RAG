The Disciplinary Committee, a formally constituted body of experts from various parts of the institution, convenes upon the invitation of its chairman whenever necessary.

Invitations are issued at least ten days prior to the meeting date. The Committee may not legally deliberate unless all its members are present.  If a quorum is not achieved during the first session, the Committee members are summoned again for a second session ten days after the first. In this case, the Committee conducts its deliberations with a majority of its members present, provided that its chairman and the general representative of the Professional Association of Insurance Companies are present.  The Committee makes its decisions by majority vote; in case of a tie, the chairman's vote prevails. No penalty may be imposed without summoning the person concerned or their legal representative by registered mail with acknowledgment of receipt for hearing. The person referred to the Disciplinary Committee is summoned at least ten days before the scheduled meeting date. The person concerned may, upon request, obtain a copy of the documents constituting the file and may appoint a lawyer. The absence of the person concerned does not prevent the Committee from proceeding with the examination of the file and imposing a penalty. The deliberations and decisions of the Disciplinary Committee are recorded in a special sealed register kept at the headquarters of the body and signed by all members present and the Committeeâ€™s secretary, appointed by the head of the body from among its staff.
