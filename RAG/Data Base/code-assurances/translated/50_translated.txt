The Minister of Finance grants the authorization referred to in Article 48 of this [Law/Code], upon a proposal from the [Authority/Commission], and this authorization must specify the types of insurance that the institution will undertake.

"The decision on the authorization shall be taken within a period of four months from the date of receipt of all the required documents. The [Authority/Commission] shall notify the interested party of the Minister of Finance's decision regarding the request for authorization."
