The insurance agent may combine traditional insurance operations with Takaful insurance operations.  An insurance contract is one in which the insurer undertakes to pay the insured or the beneficiary a sum of money, a periodic income, or any other financial compensation in the event of the occurrence of the insured event, in exchange for premiums or any other financial payment made by the insured to the insurer.
