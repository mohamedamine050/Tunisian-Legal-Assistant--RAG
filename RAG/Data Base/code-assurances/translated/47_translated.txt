Insurance institutions must submit their definitions of various types of insurance to the "General Insurance Authority" before they are implemented. "Insurance definitions related to life insurance must be certified as accurate by an actuary who meets the conditions specified by an order. Actuaries cannot certify the accuracy of life insurance definitions unless they have signed a contract specifying the conditions approved by a decision of the "Minister of Finance, upon the proposal of the Authority," and are registered in the professional association's registry of insurance institutions." (Amended by Article 5 of Law No. 91 of 2001 dated August 7, 2001).
