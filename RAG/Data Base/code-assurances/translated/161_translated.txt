If the beneficiary of the compensation is a minor or lacks legal capacity, the insurer must submit the amicable settlement offer to the Judge of the Court of First Instance for approval in accordance with the provisions of Article 15 of the Code of Obligations and Contracts.  In the event of the insurer's failure to comply with this condition, any interested party, except the insurer, may request the annulment of the settlement.
