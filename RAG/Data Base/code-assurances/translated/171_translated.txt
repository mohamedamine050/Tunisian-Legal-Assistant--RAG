If the insurer fails to submit a list of the amounts stipulated in Article 170 of this Code, these entities, after the insurer has paid compensation, cannot bring a recourse action except against the injured party or their successors in title upon death. An agreement shall be concluded between insurers and social security funds or similar entities to determine the rights and obligations of all parties. This agreement shall be approved by order.
