A fund called the "Guarantor Fund for Victims of Road Accidents" is established.  This fund is entrusted with the payment of compensation due to victims of accidents causing subsequent damage to persons or to those who inherit their rights upon death.  This applies if these accidents occur within the territory of the Tunisian Republic and are caused by motor vehicles or their trailers, excluding vehicles owned by the state and vehicles operating on railways. This applies in cases where the person responsible for the accident cannot be identified or in cases of lack of insurance.  Insurance is a contract whereby the insurer undertakes to pay the insured or the beneficiary a sum of money, a regular income, or any other financial compensation in the event of the occurrence of the insured event, in exchange for premiums or any other financial payment made by the insured to the insurer, as stipulated in paragraph "a" of Article 120 of this Code, and subject to the exceptions from the guarantee stipulated in Article 118 of this Code.
