**On Insurance Institutions**

**Insurance Contract**

The contract is a binding legal agreement that obligates the contracting parties and defines their obligations and rights concerning the specific transaction.

By it, the insurer undertakes to pay the insured or the beneficiary a sum of money, a regular income, or any other financial compensation in the event of the occurrence of the insured event, in exchange for premiums or any other financial payment made by the insured to the insurer.

Insurance institutions shall register sufficient technical reserves to cover all their commitments to the insured and the beneficiaries of the contracts within the liabilities of their balance sheets, and shall invest the funds of these reserves in assets of the same balance sheets. The list of technical reserves, the method of calculating them, and the conditions for their investment shall be determined by a decree of the Minister of Finance.
