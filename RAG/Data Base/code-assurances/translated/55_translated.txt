Insurance companies, by their very nature, are contracts whereby the insurer undertakes to pay the insured or the beneficiary a sum of money, a periodic income, or any other financial compensation in the event of the occurrence of the insured event. This is in exchange for premiums or any other financial payment made by the insured to the insurer.

Cooperative insurance companies are considered civil companies, provided that they guarantee their members the payment of their commitments in full in the event of the occurrence of one of the risks they have covered in exchange for a membership fee. They must also undertake to distribute the surplus of their assets to their members under the conditions set out in their articles of association.
