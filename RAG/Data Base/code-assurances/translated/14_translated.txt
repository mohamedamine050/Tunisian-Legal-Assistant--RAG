All claims arising from a contract of insurance become time-barred after two years from the date of the event giving rise to the claim. However, this limitation period does not apply:

1) In cases of delay, negligence, misrepresentation or incorrect disclosure of the risk, except from the date on which the insurer became aware of it. 
2) In case of an accident, except from the date on which the relevant parties became aware of its occurrence, provided that they prove they were unaware of it until then.

The limitation period for an action brought by the insured against the insurer arising from an action taken by a third party does not commence until the day on which this third party initiates legal proceedings against the insured or obtains compensation from them.
