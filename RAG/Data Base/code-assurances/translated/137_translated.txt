If the permanent disability percentage of the injured party equals or exceeds eighty percent, they may be granted compensation under the heading of "assistance from another person."

The need for assistance from another person must be stated in the report prepared by the expert physician.  The compensation granted under this heading is equal to twenty percent of the value of the permanent physical disability compensation. This compensation is paid according to the method of compensation for physical and occupational damage.
