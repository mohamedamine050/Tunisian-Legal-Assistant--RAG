In addition to the usual grounds for annulment, an insurance contract shall be void if:

The insured intentionally conceals a fact or intentionally provides an incorrect statement in the declaration of the risk, and this had an impact on the assessment of the insured risk, even if the concealment or the incorrect statement did not influence the occurrence of the event. Concealment by the insured or providing an incorrect statement shall not result in the annulment of the contract unless the insurer proves that the insured acted in bad faith. In all other cases, if the insurer becomes aware of the concealment or the incorrect statement before the occurrence of the event, it has the right to terminate the contract after ten days from the date of informing the insured by registered letter with acknowledgment of receipt, unless the insured accepts an increase in the insurance premium commensurate with the true nature of the insured risk. If the termination occurs, the insurer shall return to the insured a part of the premium corresponding to the period during which the insured risk did not occur. 

If the insurer becomes aware of the concealment or the incorrect statement after the occurrence of the event, it has the right to reduce the compensation by a percentage equal to the share of the premium paid out of the premium that should have been paid had there been no concealment or incorrect statement. The provisions of this chapter apply in the case of a declaration during the term of the contract of the new circumstances provided for in paragraph 3 of Chapter VII of this code.
