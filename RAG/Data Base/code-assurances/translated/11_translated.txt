The insured may terminate the insurance contract.

The contract is a binding legal agreement that obligates the contracting parties and defines their obligations and rights with respect to the specific transaction. The insurer undertakes to pay the insured or the beneficiary a sum of money, a periodic income, or any other financial compensation in the event of the occurrence of the insured event, in exchange for premiums or any other financial payment made by the insured to the insurer.

If the insured fails to pay the premium or the membership fee or the portion of which its term has expired, the termination shall not take effect unless twenty days have passed since the insured was served with a notice of payment at his last known address by the insurer, by registered mail with acknowledgment of receipt. The letter shall obligatorily include a clear indication that it is addressed as a notice to the insured, a reminder of the deadline for paying the premium, and the inclusion of the substance of the provisions of this article. The insurer has the right to terminate the contract or to seek its enforcement before the courts ten days after the deadline stipulated in the first paragraph of this article. Termination may be effected upon a statement from the insurer by registered mail with acknowledgment of receipt addressed to the insured.

The insurance contract that has been terminated shall not regain its effect until the day following the day of payment of the overdue premiums. Termination results in the insurer not being entitled to any remaining premium relating to the period during which the insured risk did not occur. Termination or suspension shall not apply to the third party in good faith benefiting from the insurance, provided that such party has no prior knowledge of the occurrence of any damage and of the notice of termination or suspension.

The insurer, in the event of damage, may oppose such third party to the extent of the amount covered by the premium of the insurance sought to be enjoyed.
