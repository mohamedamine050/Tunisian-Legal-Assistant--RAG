In the event that the insurer fails to submit a settlement offer, late payment interest shall be calculated at one and a half times the statutory civil interest rate on the judicially awarded amount, commencing from the expiry of the statutory period stipulated in the third paragraph of Article 148 of this Code until the date of issuance of the final and binding judgment, unless it has been executed beforehand.  A penalty equal to 10% of the judicially awarded amount shall be imposed on the insurer, payable to the Road Accident Prevention Fund established under Article 177 of this Code.
