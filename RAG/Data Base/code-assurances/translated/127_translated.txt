Compensation for damages sustained by the victim due to temporary or permanent disability from work, or by those inheriting their rights upon death, is calculated based on the actual loss of income received by the victim during the year preceding the date of the incident, as declared to the Social Security Administration. If the actual duration of work is less than one year, the compensation calculation rule is determined by multiplying the average daily wage by three hundred and sixty days. When necessary, social security beneficiaries registered with a social security fund may provide declarations of wages or income brackets to the relevant fund. If the victim fails to provide a tax declaration or a declaration submitted to the social security fund to prove their income, their income shall be considered equivalent to the minimum annual guaranteed wage for a forty-hour work week.
