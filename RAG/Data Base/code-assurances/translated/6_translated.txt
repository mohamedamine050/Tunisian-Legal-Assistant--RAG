The insurance premium shall be paid. 

An insurance contract is an agreement whereby the insurer undertakes to pay the insured or the beneficiary a sum of money, a regular income, or any other financial compensation in the event of the occurrence of the insured event, in return for premiums or other financial payments made by the insured to the insurer. Alternatively, the premium can be paid at the insurer's office or at the office of the agent designated by the insurer for this purpose. However, payment may be made at the insured's office or any other agreed-upon location, in accordance with the conditions and procedures determined by a decision of the Minister of Finance.
