The Road Accident Victims Guarantee Fund, after making compensation, shall substitute the beneficiary in respect of his rights and claims against the person responsible for the accident, and to the extent of that compensation.  The Fund is entitled to claim interest calculated at the statutory civil interest rate from the date of payment of compensation until the date of its recovery.  If a settlement is reached between the Fund and the victim or his heirs in the event of death, the person responsible for the accident may object to this settlement.
