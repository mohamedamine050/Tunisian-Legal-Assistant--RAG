The insured party is obligated to: 1) Pay the insurance premium as per the terms of the insurance contract. The contract is a legally binding agreement that binds the parties and defines their obligations and rights concerning the specific transaction. By the contract, the insurer undertakes to pay the insured party or the beneficiary a sum of money, a regular income, or any other financial compensation in the event of the occurrence of the insured event, in return for premiums or any other financial payment made by the insured to the insurer or the agreed subscription fee. 2) To truthfully and accurately answer all questions included in the risk disclosure form, which the insurer uses to inquire about circumstances that will enable it to assess the risks it undertakes. 3) To inform the insurer of any new circumstances that arise during the term of the contract and make the answers provided in the risk disclosure form inaccurate. The insured must inform the insurer of these circumstances within eight days of becoming aware of them. 4) To inform the insurer of any event that could lead to its guarantee, upon becoming aware of it. In all cases, this must be done within five working days of becoming aware of the event. This deadline is reduced to two days in the case of theft and twenty-four hours in the case of the death of livestock. The deadlines set out in paragraphs 3 and 4 of this chapter can be extended by mutual agreement between the contracting parties. If one of the clauses of the contract stipulates the forfeiture of rights due to late notification beyond the deadlines set out in paragraph 4 of this chapter, the insured cannot be challenged on this forfeiture if he proves that it was impossible to notify within the specified time due to an emergency or force majeure. The provisions of paragraphs 1, 3, and 4 of this chapter do not apply to life insurance contracts.
