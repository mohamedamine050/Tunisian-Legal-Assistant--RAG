The indemnities arising from insurance contracts are granted, without the need for express authorization, to the beneficiaries, privileged creditors, and mortgage holders in accordance with their order, who have notified the insurer of their rights before the payment of such indemnities. The insurer shall directly inform the beneficiaries by registered letter with acknowledgment of receipt, notifying them of the amount of indemnities paid for their benefit, within a period of one month from the date of receipt of the enforceable judgment ordering the indemnity.
