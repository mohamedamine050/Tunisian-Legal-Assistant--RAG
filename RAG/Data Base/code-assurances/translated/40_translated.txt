If an insurance contract is concluded, 

The contract is a binding legal agreement that obliges the contracting parties and defines their obligations and rights with regard to the specific transaction. Through this contract, the insurer undertakes to pay the insured or the beneficiary a sum of money, a regular income, or any other financial compensation in the event of the occurrence of the insured event, in exchange for premiums or any other financial payment made by the insured to the insurer.

In the event of death without the designation of a beneficiary, or if the designated beneficiary waives their right under the contract, the insured capital or guaranteed allowance shall be included in the deceased's estate.
