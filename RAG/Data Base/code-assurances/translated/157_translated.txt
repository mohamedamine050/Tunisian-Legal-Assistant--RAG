The insurer who submits a settlement offer after the deadline stipulated in Article 148 of this Code shall be charged with interest on the arrears, calculated as one and a half times the legal civil interest rate applied to the amount awarded by the court. This interest shall be calculated from the expiration of the statutory deadline until the date of submission of the settlement offer or the date of the final judgment, unless it has been enforced prior to that date.
