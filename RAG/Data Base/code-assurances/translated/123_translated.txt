The driver of a motorized land vehicle, whether wholly or partially motorized, as well as those who inherit their rights upon death, shall be barred from compensation for damages to persons in traffic accidents, in accordance with the proportion of liability attributed to them in the accident, which shall be determined in accordance with the criteria set forth in the liability determination table annexed to this law. Liability in traffic accidents involving vehicles running on railway lines shall be determined in accordance with the existing laws. In the event that it is impossible to determine the liability arising from the collision between two or more vehicles, each driver, or those who inherit their rights upon death, shall be entitled to receive only half of the compensation due.
