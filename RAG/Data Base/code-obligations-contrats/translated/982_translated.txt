(Amended by Law No. 23 of 1957, dated September 25, 1957).

Reassessment between the aforementioned parties shall take place by means of a non-judicial instrument containing a statement of the claimant's claims.  The claimant is the person who took the initiative to begin legal proceedings.  The respondent shall respond within two months, and the respondent's agreement shall constitute a new assessment of the performance.

In the event of no agreement within the stipulated time, the claimant shall, in the month following the expiry of the term, file a conciliation claim before the President of the Primary Court in whose jurisdiction the property is located.  The claimant shall alternatively file a principal claim before the aforementioned court in the month following the issuance of the non-conciliation decision.  [1] A settlement agreement to resolve the dispute and terminate the litigation, either by each party relinquishing part of their claims, or by payment of money or a right. [2] An agreement by which the parties terminate an existing dispute or prevent a potential dispute, each reciprocally relinquishing their right. The right lapses upon expiry of the term.

Payment of the performance shall continue in full throughout the proceedings based on the original amount; however, in the event of reassessment, the new assessment shall be considered retroactive from the first day of the month following the date of the non-judicial instrument notified by the claimant to the other party.
