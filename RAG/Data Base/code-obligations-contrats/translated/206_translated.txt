The assignment of real estate or other mortgageable property;

A formal mortgage is a contract by which the creditor acquires a real right over a property designated to satisfy his debt.  By virtue of this right, he may take precedence over ordinary creditors and subsequent creditors in the recovery of his right from the price of that property, regardless of its ownership.

Real estate mortgages or periodic income assigned to it are not considered valid against third parties unless they are for a period exceeding one year and are documented in writings with a fixed date.
