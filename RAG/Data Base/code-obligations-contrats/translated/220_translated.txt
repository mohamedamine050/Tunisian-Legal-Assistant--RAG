If a business, with all its assets, is transferred and the transferee continues to operate it under its commercial name, then the transferee is bound by all the obligations of the transferor arising from the operation of the transferred business. Debts related to the business are automatically transferred to the transferee.  Public notice among traders serves as notification to third parties, as provided for in Article 205, concerning those who are not parties to the contract. Any agreement contradicting this is unenforceable against third parties unless the transferor or transferee personally notifies them.
