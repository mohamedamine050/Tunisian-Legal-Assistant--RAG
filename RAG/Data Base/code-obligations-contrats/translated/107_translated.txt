Losses arising from a misdemeanor.

A misdemeanor is defined as a crime punishable by imprisonment exceeding fifteen days but not exceeding five years, or by a fine exceeding sixty dinars, or similar offenses.  This includes actual damage suffered by the claimant, expenses incurred or to be incurred to remedy the consequences of the harmful act, and usual profits lost due to that act. The assessment of loss by the court varies depending on the cause of the damage.

[1] Harm inflicted in violation of the law affecting a person's body, mental or psychological health, reputation, property, or honor. [2] Loss or damage inflicted on property, deprivation of comfort, or harm to physical well-being, reputation, or the like.  Damage in crimes and similar offenses is the loss actually suffered by the claimant, and the necessary expenses that he was or will be compelled to spend to repair the consequences of the act committed to his detriment, as well as what he was deprived of in the normal range of the consequences of this act, whether it be fraudulent or negligent.
