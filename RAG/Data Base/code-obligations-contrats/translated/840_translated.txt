Whoever undertakes to complete a work or provide a service is entitled to the full remuneration, even if the performance of the service or completion of the work becomes impossible due to a reason attributable to the lessor, provided the lessee was ready to perform the service or work and had not undertaken himself to another person.

However, the court may reduce the agreed-upon remuneration as circumstances warrant.
