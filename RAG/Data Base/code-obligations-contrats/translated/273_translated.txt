If the term expires and the debtor defaults on performance, the creditor has the right to compel the debtor to perform if possible; otherwise, to rescind the contract with compensation for any resulting losses in both cases.  If performance is requested, and if performance is possible only in part, the creditor may choose either partial performance or rescission of the contract with compensation for losses in both cases.  In cases of delay, the rules stipulated in the articles concerning specific contracts shall apply.

Rescission of the contract shall only be by court order.
