The seller's guarantee to the buyer is limited to two matters:

Firstly: Possession of the object of sale and disposal thereof without opposition; this is the guarantee of entitlement.

Secondly: Its freedom from defects; this is the guarantee against defects.

The seller is bound by this guarantee even if it is not explicitly stipulated in the contract, and his responsibility is not released by the mere existence of a suspicion against him.
