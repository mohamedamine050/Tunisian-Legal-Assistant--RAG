If the assignment includes a mortgage, the formal mortgage is a contract by which the creditor acquires a real right over a property designated to satisfy his debt, enabling him to take precedence over ordinary creditors and subsequent creditors in the recovery of his right from the price of that property, regardless of its possessor.  The assignee enters into the assignor's position in all matters concerning the preservation and maintenance of the mortgaged property from the time of its transfer to him.

If these obligations are not fulfilled, both the assignor and the assignee shall be jointly and severally liable to the debtor for any resulting consequences.

This rule shall not apply if the assignment is made by operation of law or by a written court judgment resolving a legal issue or question of fact. In this case, the judge alone shall be liable to the debtor for the mortgaged property.
