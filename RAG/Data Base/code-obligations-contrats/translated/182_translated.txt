A release by the creditor of one of several jointly and severally liable debtors discharges the entire debt owed unless the creditor states that he only intended to release the debtor from his share.  In such a case, the remaining debtors have no right to pursue the debtor benefited by the release except by claiming a proportionate share from the insolvent debtorâ€™s portion.
