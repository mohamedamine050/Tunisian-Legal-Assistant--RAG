The default of one of several jointly and severally liable debtors, or his default in payment, does not prejudice the others.  The forfeiture of his right to the term, as stipulated in Article 149, applies only to him.  A final and unappealable judgment relates only to the debtor who was a party to the proceedings, whether judgment is for or against him. All of this is subject to the contract or the nature of the case containing no provision to the contrary.
