The buyer, if his right of rescission is established, may demand from the seller the restitution of the price agreed upon by the contracting parties, even if it exceeds or falls short of the value of the goods sold. This right applies even if a change occurs in the entire subject matter of the sale or in part thereof, or if its value diminishes due to the buyer's act, negligence, or an unforeseen event.
