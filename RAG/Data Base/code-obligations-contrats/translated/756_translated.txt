If a public administration action, such as works or decisions, is in accordance with the law, and this causes a significant reduction in the lessee's enjoyment, the lessee may request termination of the lease or a proportionate reduction in its value, as the circumstances require. This may lead to a claim for damages.

Damage [1] Harm caused in violation of the law affecting a person's body, mental or psychological health, reputation, property, or reputation; [2] Loss or damage to property, deprivation of comfort, or harm to physical well-being, reputation, or the like. - In crimes and quasi-crimes, damage is the loss actually suffered by the claimant and the necessary expenses that he has been or will be compelled to incur to repair the consequences of the act committed to his detriment, as well as what he has been deprived of within the normal limits of the consequences of this act by the lessor, if the cause is attributable to him, unless there are contractual stipulations to the contrary.
