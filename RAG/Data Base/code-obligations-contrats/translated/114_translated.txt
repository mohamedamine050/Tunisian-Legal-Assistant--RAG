If there is a misdemeanor, described as a crime punishable by imprisonment exceeding fifteen days but not exceeding five years, or by a fine exceeding sixty dinars, or similar, the heir is obligated in the same manner as the predecessor.

And if the heir is aware of defects in the ownership of his predecessor, he is obligated in the same manner for anything arising from a fortuitous event or force majeure, with restitution of the exploitation of what he inherited from the day he came into possession of it.
