Performance shall be at the place dictated by the nature of the subject matter of the contract, or at the place specified in the contract.  If the place of performance is not specified in the contract, it shall be at the place of contracting. If the transport of the thing involves expenses or hardship, and if transport is possible otherwise, performance shall be at the debtor's location wherever the creditor may be found, unless the creditor has an acceptable excuse for not accepting performance there. If the obligation arises from a misdemeanor, described as misdemeanors which warrant imprisonment exceeding fifteen days but not exceeding five years, or a fine exceeding sixty dinars, performance shall be where the court that heard the case is located.
