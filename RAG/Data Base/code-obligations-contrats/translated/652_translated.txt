If a movable, excluding animals, is sold, the buyer must inspect it upon receipt. If the buyer finds a defect, they must immediately inform the seller.  If the buyer fails to inform the seller within seven days following the day of receipt, their silence will be considered acceptance, unless the defects were such as to be hidden upon inspection by someone who did not examine carefully, or unless the buyer had an impediment preventing inspection. In these two cases, the buyer must inform the seller as soon as they become aware of the defect; otherwise, they will be considered to have accepted. This is the case if the seller was not fraudulent; otherwise, the buyer's silence will not be considered acceptance.
