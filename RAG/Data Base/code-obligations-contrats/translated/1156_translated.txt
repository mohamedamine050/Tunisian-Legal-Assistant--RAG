If an agent acts without authorization or exceeds the limits of his agency, he shall be liable for the resulting loss to the party with whom he contracted, unless it is possible to complete what they contracted, unless he informed the other party of the true situation from the outset, or it is proven that the other party was aware of it; all this provided that he did not undertake to complete the contract.
