Contractors and artisans employed in construction or other works undertaken on a contractual basis may directly claim from the owner the amounts owed by the owner to the contractor upon the enforcement of a lien by one of them or thereafter.

They have the right to precedence over others, each to the extent of their share, in the amounts the owner pays them directly by order of the court.  As for those who have an agreement with the original contractor and suppliers of raw materials, they do not have the right to claim directly from the lessee, but rather they may exercise the rights and claims of the original contractor against him.
