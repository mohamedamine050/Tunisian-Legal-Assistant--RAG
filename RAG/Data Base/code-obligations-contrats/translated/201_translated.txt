Assignment is void in the following instances:

Firstly: If the debt or right is not assignable due to a contractual provision or legal provision. This does not contradict the ruling dated 13 Rabi' al-Awwal 1316 corresponding to 1 August 1898.

Secondly: If the subject matter of the assignment consists of purely personal rights.

Thirdly: If the debt is not subject to assignment or objection; however, if assignment is accepted in part or for a specific amount, then assignment is permissible for that part or amount.
