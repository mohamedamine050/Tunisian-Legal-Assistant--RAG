The borrower may recover from the lender the unforeseen expenses which were necessarily incurred on the loan before the borrower could inform the lender of them.  The borrower is entitled to retain the loan as security for these expenses. If the borrower delays in returning the loan, he shall not recover any expenses incurred during the period of delay.
