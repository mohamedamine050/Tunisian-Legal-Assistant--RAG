The lessee shall compensate the lessor for any losses caused by the lessee, unless the lessee immediately informs the lessor of all events occurring in the leased property that require the lessor's intervention, whether this is for necessary repairs, the appearance of an unforeseen defect, damage to the property, or a claim filed against its ownership or any of its rights, or for harm suffered by the lessee from a third party.  A claim is a legal procedure initiated by a claimant before a court against another party, whether an individual or a private entity, in which the claimant demands a right or compensation for a loss caused by that party.
