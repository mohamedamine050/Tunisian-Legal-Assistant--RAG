(The last paragraph was added by Law No. 57 of 2000, dated June 13, 2000).

The signature must be handwritten by the contracting party himself at the bottom of the document; a stamp does not suffice, and its presence is considered equivalent to its absence. The signature consists of placing a name or a special mark in the contracting party's own handwriting integrated into the document, or, if electronic, in the use of a reliable method that guarantees the link between the aforementioned signature and the related electronic document.
