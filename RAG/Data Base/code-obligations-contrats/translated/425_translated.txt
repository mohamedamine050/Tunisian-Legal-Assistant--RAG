If the law does not stipulate a specific form for proving the contract, the contract is a legally binding agreement that obligates the contracting parties and defines their obligations and rights concerning the specific transaction.  If the contracting parties explicitly agreed that the contract shall not be considered final unless drawn up in a known form, then the contract is only valid if it is in the agreed-upon form.
