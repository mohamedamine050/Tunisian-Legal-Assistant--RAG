If the power of attorney expires due to the death of the principal, his bankruptcy, or any other event that renders him incapable, and this matter is confirmed, and no competent heir or legal guardian of the heir or of the principal is present, then the agent shall complete what he has commenced to the extent that the matter permits in the circumstances and shall do whatever is required by the situation in the best interest of his principal.  He may then reimburse himself from his own funds for any expenses incurred or advances made to complete the task entrusted to him, as provided for in the case of a volunteer agent.
