If the purchased item is reclaimed from the buyer without their acknowledgment, the seller must return to the buyer:

Firstly:

The price;
The price agreed upon by the contracting parties, whether exceeding or falling short of the value of the sale; and
The cost of the contract and any expenses incurred in relation to the contract.  A contract is a legally binding agreement that obligates the contracting parties and defines their obligations and rights concerning the specific transaction.


Secondly: All legal expenses incurred by the buyer in their action against the seller. An action is a legal procedure initiated by a claimant before a court against another party, be it an individual or a private entity, claiming a right or compensation for a loss caused by said party.


Thirdly: The losses incurred by the buyer due to the reclamation of the purchased item from their possession.
