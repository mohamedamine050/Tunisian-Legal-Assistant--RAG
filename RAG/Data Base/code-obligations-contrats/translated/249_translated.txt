If the obligation does not require that the obligor perform it personally, it is permissible for a third party to perform it, even without the consent of the creditor, for the purpose of discharging the debtor, provided that the act of the third party is performed in the name of the obligor and for the purpose of relieving him of his obligation.  However, it is not permissible to perform the obligation without the consent of both the debtor and the creditor.
