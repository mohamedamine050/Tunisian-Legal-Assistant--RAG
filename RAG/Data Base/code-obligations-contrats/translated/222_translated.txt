Whenever a business establishment, including its assets or the estate of a deceased person, is transferred, the creditors of the aforementioned have the right to claim from the time of the transfer against both the previous debtor and the transferee, as their rights dictate, unless they explicitly consent to the transfer.  The transferee is only liable to the extent of the assets transferred to him according to the inventory of the estate. His liability is not released or reduced by any conditions agreed upon with the previous debtor.
