If a legal action is brought by a claimant before a court against another party, which may be an individual or a private entity, claiming a right or compensation for a loss caused by them, and the document is alleged to be forged, its execution shall be stayed pending consideration of the claim.  And as long as a judgment has not been issued accepting the claim, or if the document is alleged to be forged incidentally, the court may temporarily stay execution of the document, as appropriate.
