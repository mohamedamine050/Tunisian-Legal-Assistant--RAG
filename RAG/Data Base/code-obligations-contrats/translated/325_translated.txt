A void obligation from its origin has no effect and entails nothing except the recovery of what was paid without right by virtue of that obligation.

An obligation is void from its origin in the following two instances:

Firstly: If it lacks one of its essential elements.

Secondly: If a written court judgment resolves a legal issue or a matter of fact, or if the law declares its invalidity in a specific instance.
