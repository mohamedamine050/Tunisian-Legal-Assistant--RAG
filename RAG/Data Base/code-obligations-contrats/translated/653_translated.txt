If a defect appears in the goods sold, the buyer must immediately request an assessment of its condition by a judge or by experts appointed by the court, in the presence of the seller or their representative if they are present.  The expertise shall cover scientific, technical, and other matters necessary to decide the legal case, excluding legal issues.  Failure to do so necessitates proving the existence of the defect in the goods upon their delivery and obtaining an assessment as mentioned above. This assessment is not required if the sale was made according to a sample and no dispute arose between the seller and the buyer regarding the sample.

Furthermore, if the goods were brought from another place and the seller had no representative at the place of delivery, the buyer must take the necessary measures for their temporary preservation. If the goods are perishable, the buyer has the right to sell them through a judge at the place of delivery after assessing their condition as mentioned above. This sale becomes obligatory upon the buyer if it is in the seller's interest. In all these cases, the buyer must immediately inform the seller; otherwise, they shall be liable to compensate the seller for any losses.
