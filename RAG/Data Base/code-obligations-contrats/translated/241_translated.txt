Obligations are not only binding upon the contracting parties, but also upon their heirs and those to whom a right has devolved from them, unless otherwise stipulated or implied by the nature of the obligation under the contract or by law. However, heirs are only liable to the extent of their inheritance and in proportion to their respective shares. If they refuse to accept the inheritance, they are not liable for any debt of their predecessor, and in that case, creditors can only pursue the assets of the deceased debtor.
