If the obligation is mutual, neither party may refrain from fulfilling its obligation until the other party fulfills its corresponding contractual obligation, unless the contract or custom requires one party to perform its obligation sooner.  If one party is obligated to perform towards several persons, it may refrain from performing its obligation to one of them until all have fulfilled their obligations.
