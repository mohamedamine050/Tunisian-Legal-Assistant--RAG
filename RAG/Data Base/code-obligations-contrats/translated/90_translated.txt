It is permissible to initiate legal action and claim damages before the criminal courts to remove what has been done in the following two situations:

Firstly: If a person affixes to manufactured goods or agricultural or industrial products any names, marks, addresses, stamps, or seals attributed to a person other than the rightful owner of those goods, whether by addition, subtraction, or other alteration of those markings, or by attributing those goods to a place other than their place of manufacture or production.

Secondly: If a person, without permission, uses the name, factory mark, address, or other distinctive marks of the manufacturer from whom the products were purchased, if these marks were not distinctive of the owner at the time of sale.
