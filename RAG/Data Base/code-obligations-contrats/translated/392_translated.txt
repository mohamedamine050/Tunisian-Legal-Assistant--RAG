The lapse of the lawsuit [1] depends on one partyâ€™s request to claim their right from another party in the presence of a judge; the claimant is called the plaintiff and the party against whom the claim is made is called the defendant. [2] A lawsuit is the right of anyone with a claim to bring it before the court for judgment on its subject matter.  As regards the opposing party, it is the right to present reasons for defense or arguments aimed at refuting that claim.  The lapse is contingent upon the passage of time in the case of minors not authorized to act for themselves and others lacking legal capacity, unless they have a guardian or representative until they reach the age of majority or are declared competent or a suitable individual is appointed to the position that fits the conditions and requirements for carrying it out in terms of qualifications and competencies.
