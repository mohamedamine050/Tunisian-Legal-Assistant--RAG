If the agents are multiple, there is no choice between them in the guarantee unless it is stipulated. However, the claim with the choice shall be directed towards them even without stipulation in the following instances:

Firstly: If the damage [1] – harm inflicted in violation of the law affecting a person’s body, mental or psychological health, reputation, property, or [2] loss or damage to property, deprivation of comfort, or harm to physical well-being, reputation, or the like – the damage in crimes and quasi-crimes is the loss actually suffered by the claimant and the necessary expenses that he was or will be compelled to spend to repair the consequences of the act committed to his detriment, as well as what he was deprived of within the normal limits of the consequences of this act, resulted from their transgression or negligence collectively, such that the responsibility of each of them cannot be specifically determined.

Secondly: If the mandate is indivisible.

Thirdly: If the agency relates to commercial matters between merchants, unless otherwise stipulated.

However, although the agents are required to choose, they are not liable for the actions of one of them if he exceeded the scope of his agency or deviated from its purpose.
