If the debt is secured by movable property, the debtor, even after offering performance, or after securing the debt, may request permission to sell the property offered to the creditor and secure the proceeds of the sale in the following circumstances:

Firstly: If he fears damage to the property due to delay.

Secondly: If the costs of preserving it exceed its value.

Thirdly: If it is not suitable for preservation in a safe place.  The sale shall then be by public auction. If its price is subject to daily fluctuation in a market or stock exchange, the court may authorize its sale at the current price through a broker or an authorized official. The debtor must immediately inform the creditor of the proceeds of the sale; otherwise, he shall be liable for compensation for any loss. He retains the right to recover from the creditor the difference between the sale price and the price agreed upon in the contract, and compensation for any resulting loss. The costs of the sale shall be borne by the creditor.
