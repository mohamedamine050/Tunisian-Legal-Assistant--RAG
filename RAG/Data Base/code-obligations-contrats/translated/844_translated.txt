Employee

An employee is a worker who works in exchange for wages.

The employee, in the service or manufacture, is responsible for the consequences of his breach of the employer's authorization, if it was explicit. If the employee had no valid reason for the breach, then if there was a reason, he was obliged to inform the employer and await his response, unless the delay risked serious consequences.
