The running of the limitation period is interrupted by any act implying the debtor's acknowledgment of his creditor's right, such as settling accounts between them or making a payment on account.  This interruption occurs if the payment is proven by a document with a fixed date, or if the debtor requests an extension of time for payment, or provides a guarantor, or offers another form of security, or pleads set-off where the creditor has a claim against him.
