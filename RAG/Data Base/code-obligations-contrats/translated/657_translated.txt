If several things are sold in a single transaction without apportionment of the price,  and the price agreed upon by the contracting parties, whether it exceeds or falls short of the value of the goods sold, and some of them are found to be defective, even after delivery, the buyer has the right to return the defective goods and recover the corresponding portion of the price agreed upon by the contracting parties, whether it exceeds or falls short of the value of the goods sold.  However, if separating the aforementioned things would cause harm, such as in the case of paired items, for example, then he is not permitted to rescind the sale except as to all of them.
