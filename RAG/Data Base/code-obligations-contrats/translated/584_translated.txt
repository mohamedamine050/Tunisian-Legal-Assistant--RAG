If the sale is concluded, the purchaser may forfeit the sale even before taking possession, and the seller may assign his right to the price.  The price is what the contracting parties agreed upon, even if it exceeds or falls short of the value of the goods sold, before its receipt, unless they have agreed otherwise.  Food, however, is excepted in the case of Muslims.
