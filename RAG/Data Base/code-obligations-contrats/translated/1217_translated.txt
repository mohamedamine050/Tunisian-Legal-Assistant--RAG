If a dispute arises between the worker and the owner of the capital regarding the following matters, the worker's oath shall prevail:

Firstly: If the worker claims damage, and no negligence or fault is attributed to him.

Secondly: If the worker claims that the capital was received as Qirad (profit-sharing loan), while the owner claims it was given as commission, commercial agency, or lease.

Thirdly: If they disagree on the amount of the Qirad capital. However, if they disagree on the worker's share of the profit—the excess of the company's assets over its liabilities, including the company's capital among its debts at the end of the financial year—the owner's oath shall prevail.
