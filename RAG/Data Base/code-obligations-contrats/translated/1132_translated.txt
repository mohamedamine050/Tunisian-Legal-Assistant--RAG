The guarantee stipulated in the previous chapter is strengthened in two instances:

Firstly: If the agent is paid.

Secondly: If the agency is on behalf of a minor, a person subject to guardianship, or a legal entity.  A minor is a person who has not reached the legal age of majority and is therefore subject to protection and laws specific to minors.
