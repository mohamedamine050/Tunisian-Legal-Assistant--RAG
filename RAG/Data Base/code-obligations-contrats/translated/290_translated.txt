If the obligation is to perform an act, the obligor's liability is not discharged by offering to perform the act. However, if the offer to perform was made at an appropriate time and in the manner specified in the agreement or by local custom, and this is proven as required at the time, the obligor shall compensate the obligee to the extent of the loss incurred had the obligation been performed. The court may reduce this amount according to the circumstances of the case.
