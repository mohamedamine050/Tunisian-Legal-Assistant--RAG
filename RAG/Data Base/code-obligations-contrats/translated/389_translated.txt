The passage of time shall cause the dismissal of the claim.

[1] A claim is a request by one party to another for the recognition of a right, in the presence of a judge; the requester is called the claimant and the requested party is called the defendant.  [2] A claim is the right of anyone entitled to a claim to submit it to the court for judgment on its subject matter.  For the opposing party, it is the right to present reasons for defense or arguments aimed at refuting that claim related to the principal obligation, and this causes the dismissal of the subordinate partial claims, even if the time period legally stipulated for their dismissal has not elapsed.
