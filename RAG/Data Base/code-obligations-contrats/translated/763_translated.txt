If the leased thing is destroyed, deteriorated, or altered in whole or in part, rendering it unfit for its intended purpose without the fault of either contracting party, then the contract is void. Neither party shall bear the loss of the other, and the lessee shall only be liable for the rent corresponding to the period of his use. Any stipulation contrary to this is null and void.
