If an oath, which one of the parties or litigants directs to his opponent to settle the dispute between them, is administered because the evidence permitted by law to prove his claim is lacking, relying on the conscience, honor, and religious commitment of that opponent; and if the oath is required, then the opponent's denial is insufficient to prove the claimant's right except by his oath.  If he takes the oath, or if the requested party returns the oath to him, a judgment will be rendered against him, even if the party from whom the oath is requested denies it.  A judgment is a written decision of the court that resolves a legal issue or fact.
