The creditor with a deferred debt has the right to protect his rights by all legal means, even before the due date.  He also has the right to request a guarantor or other forms of security, or to request an *aqlala*.

The *aqlala* empowers the creditor holding an enforceable instrument to place the debtor's movable property in the possession of the court.  The creditor may do this if he has valid reasons to anticipate the debtor's insolvency or escape.
