Loan for Use Agreement

Agreement

The agreement is a legally binding contract that obligates the contracting parties and defines their obligations and rights with respect to the specific transaction.  One party delivers something to the other to benefit from it for a specific period or purpose, on condition that the borrower returns the same item, the lender retaining ownership and lawful possession of the thing, such that the borrower has only the use thereof.
