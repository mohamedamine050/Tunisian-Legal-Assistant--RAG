The seller guarantees the buyer's peaceful possession of the subject matter of the sale against any defect existing at the time of sale. This guarantee takes three forms:

Firstly: If the buyer is prevented from possessing all or part of the subject matter of the sale.

Secondly: If the subject matter of the sale is in the possession of a third party and cannot be recovered from them.

Thirdly: If the buyer is compelled to incur a loss to recover the subject matter of the sale.
