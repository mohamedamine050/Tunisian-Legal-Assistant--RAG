Evidence may be obtained in writing from official and unofficial documents. It may also be obtained from telegrams and other documents, from the parties' ledgers, signed brokers' lists (as required by the parties), accepted invoices, and special registers and writings, among other written evidence.  The court retains the discretion to determine the weight to be given to each piece of evidence according to the circumstances, unless the law requires, or the parties explicitly stipulate, a specific form.
