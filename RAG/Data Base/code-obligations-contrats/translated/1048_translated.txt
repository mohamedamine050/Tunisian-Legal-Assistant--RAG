If the seized property is perishable, it may be sold with the judge's permission and in the manner prescribed for the sale of mortgaged property.

A formal mortgage is a contract whereby the creditor acquires a real right over a property designated to satisfy his debt.  By virtue of this right, he may take precedence over ordinary creditors and subsequent creditors in the recovery of his debt from the proceeds of that property, regardless of its possessor.

Then, the seizure shall apply to the proceeds of the sale.
