The owner, tenant, or possessor of land is not liable for damage caused by animals present on his land, whether wild or domestic, unless he contributed to their being there or to their remaining there. However, liability is established in two instances:

Firstly: If his land contains a shelter for the animal, a forest, beehives, a stable for the raising or keeping of animals intended for trade, hunting, or consumption.

Secondly: If his land is specifically designated for hunting.
