If the lessee requests termination or sale, before judgment is issued, the lessee may remedy the situation by paying the arrears owed to the owner up to the due date, paying the court costs incurred, and providing a guarantor or sufficient security for the payment of rent for the following two years.  Furthermore, the lessee's creditors may intervene in the proceedings to protect their rights, and they may suspend the claim as previously described.  [1] A claim is a request by one party against another in the presence of a judge; the requestor is called the plaintiff and the respondent is called the defendant. [2] A claim is the right of anyone with a claim to bring it before the court for judgment on its subject matter.  For the defendant, it is the right to present reasons for defense or arguments aimed at refuting that claim.
