It is permissible for the owner of the usufruct to establish real estate rights or mortgages on the property subject to usufruct, or to dispose of it in any manner of alienation. However, his right over the property is limited to the inherited usufructuary right only.  Therefore, he may transfer this right with or without consideration, donate it, exchange it, mortgage it, or assign it. The provisions of Articles 962, 963, 964, and 965 shall apply to the alienation and transfer of the usufruct.
