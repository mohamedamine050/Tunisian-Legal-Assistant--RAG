The court may, as the case may be, order the return of the seized goods to the creditor if the debtor offers to deposit with him an equivalent sum or thing, or to secure the amount claimed by the creditor until the resolution of the dispute between them. The court may also order the return of part of the goods, if possible, if the debtor offers to secure an equivalent amount.  The provision of a guarantor [1] is one who undertakes the obligation of another while the obligation remains on the latter, or who adds his own liability to that of another for an obligation, whether present or future [2], meaning a person who provides or issues a guarantee or surety payable on demand, a letter of guarantee, or any other form of guarantee: this is for the purpose of securing the fulfillment of any obligation in favor of a creditor.  A guarantee document alone is not sufficient to release the seized goods.
