A non-judicial confession is one not issued by a judge, and may arise from any act contrary to what the defendant claims.  A mere request for reconciliation [1] is a contract designed to resolve a dispute and terminate litigation, either by each of the parties in reconciliation conceding a portion of their claims or by the delivery of money or a right; [2] a contract by which the parties terminate an existing dispute or prevent a potential dispute, by each mutually relinquishing their right in the lawsuit. A lawsuit [a legal procedure initiated by a claimant before a court against another party, whether an individual or a private entity, claiming a right or compensation for a loss caused by that party] does not constitute a confession of the right in dispute; however, acceptance of release or waiver of the original right implies a confession.
