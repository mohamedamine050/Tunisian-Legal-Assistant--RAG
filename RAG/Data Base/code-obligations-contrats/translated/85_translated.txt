If a public official or employee of a public administration causes harm, whether physical or moral, to another person during the direct performance of their assigned duties, and this harm was caused intentionally or through gross negligence on their part, then

they are obligated to compensate for that harm if it is proven that the cause was their intent or gross negligence. However, if the negligence was not gross, the person who suffered the harm has no recourse against the employee unless they have no other means of obtaining redress.  The provisions of this article do not apply to appointed notaries, as the rules governing their rights and obligations are those of employment contracts.
