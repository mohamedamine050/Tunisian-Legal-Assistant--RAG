Whoever disseminates through newspapers, or any other means, or confirms information that is contrary to the truth and is likely to harm the reputation, honor, or interests of the person or group to whom it is disseminated, shall be liable for any resulting damage.

Damage [1] means harm caused in violation of the law, affecting a person's body, mental or psychological health, reputation, property, or honor. [2] It also includes loss or damage to property, deprivation of comfort, or harm to physical well-being, reputation, or similar.  In crimes and quasi-crimes, damage refers to the actual loss suffered by the claimant, the necessary expenses incurred or to be incurred to remedy the consequences of the harmful act, and any benefit deprived within the normal limits of the consequences of that act.

If the person knew, or should have known, that the information attributed to another was untrue, all of this shall apply in accordance with penal provisions.  This ruling also applies to anyone who defames another by words, actions, or writing, if the defamation is considered a misdemeanor under the penal code.

This ruling applies to anyone who prints defamatory or scandalous material about another, with recourse available against both the writer and the printer.

The claim [1] is a request by one party for their rights from another before a judge; the requester is called the claimant and the respondent is called the defendant. [2] A claim is the right of anyone with a grievance to bring it before a court for judgment on the matter. It is, for the defendant, the right to present defenses or arguments aimed at refuting that request.

The claim lapses after five full months from the date of the act or the date of the last action of the claim. If the aforementioned action involves no publication or announcement, the right to bring the claim lapses after five months from the date the harmed party became aware of it.
