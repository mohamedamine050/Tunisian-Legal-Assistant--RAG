If the buyer experiences an encumbrance on the sale or fears its imminent occurrence based on a valid instrument by virtue of a right superior to the sale, then the buyer has the right to withhold the price, the price agreed upon by the contracting parties, whether it exceeds or falls short of the value of the sale, until the seller removes the encumbrance. However, the seller may require the buyer to pay the price, the price agreed upon by the contracting parties, whether it exceeds or falls short of the value of the sale, provided that he gives a guarantee or other security for the return of the price, the price agreed upon by the contracting parties, whether it exceeds or falls short of the value of the sale, and the expenses of the contract to the buyer if the sale is valid.

And if the encumbrance occurs on part of the sale, then the buyer is not entitled to withhold from the price, the price agreed upon by the contracting parties, whether it exceeds or falls short of the value of the sale, except that which corresponds to that part, and the seller's security is also limited to that which corresponds to that part. However, the buyer is not entitled to withhold the price, the price agreed upon by the contracting parties, whether it exceeds or falls short of the value of the sale, if he undertakes to pay it even with the occurrence of the encumbrance, or if he was aware of the intention to bring a claim of ownership.
