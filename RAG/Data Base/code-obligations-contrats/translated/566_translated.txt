Judges, court clerks, lawyers, and litigation agents may not acquire, through purchase or assignment, any of the rights in dispute before the courts in which they perform their duties, whether the purchase or assignment is in their own name or in the name of another.  Such sale is void, and the judgment of nullity may be rendered upon the request of any party with an interest therein, or even without such request.
