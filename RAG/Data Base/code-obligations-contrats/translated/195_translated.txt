If one of the creditors, whose claim is indivisible, suffers a lapse in the period for filing a claim, [1] one party requests their right from another in the presence of a judge; the requester is called the claimant and the one requested from is called the defendant. [2] A claim is the right of every claimant to bring it before the court to obtain a judgment on its subject matter. It is, for the defendant, the right to present defenses or arguments aimed at refuting that claim.  If such a lapse occurs against one of the debtors in the period for initiating proceedings against them, this lapse benefits all of them.
