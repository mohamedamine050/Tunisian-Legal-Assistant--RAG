(Completed by order dated May 4, 1920). If the lessee cultivates the land, then his entire crop is destroyed by a fortuitous event or force majeure without any fault on his part, he is entitled to the cancellation of the rent and the reimbursement of any sums paid in advance.

If part of the crop is destroyed, there is no cancellation or reimbursement unless the destroyed portion exceeds one-half.

Furthermore, there is no cancellation or reimbursement if the lessee obtains compensation for his losses from the person responsible or from an insurance company.

The cancellation or reduction of the rent, as stipulated in this chapter, must take place before October 1st of the year in which the total or partial destruction of the crop occurred due to a fortuitous event or force majeure; otherwise, the right is forfeited.
