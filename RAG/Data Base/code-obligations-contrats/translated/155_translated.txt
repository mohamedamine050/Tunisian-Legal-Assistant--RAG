If the party with the right of option dies before exercising that right, the right of option devolves upon his heirs for the remaining period of the option.  If he becomes bankrupt, the right of option devolves upon his creditors collectively.

If no agreement is reached among his heirs or creditors, the other contracting party may request that they be given a deadline to declare their choice. If the deadline expires without a choice being made, the right of option reverts to him.
