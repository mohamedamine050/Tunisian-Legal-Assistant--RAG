A condition is a declaration of the contracting parties' intent, by virtue of which the existence or extinguishment of an obligation is made dependent on a future uncertain event.  An event that has already occurred at the time of the contract or before it, does not constitute a condition, even if the contracting parties were unaware of its existence.
