The dismissal of an agent from the entire agency or from part thereof shall not be binding on one with whom the agent contracted while ignorant of the dismissal.  The principal may then claim recourse against the agent. If the law stipulates a specific method for the revocation of the agency, the dismissal must be effected by that method as well.
