If the lessee delays payment of the agreed rent for two consecutive years, the lessor has the choice between two options:

1. To request termination of the contract and the return of the property to its owner, and to order the lessee to pay any outstanding rent.  In this case, the property returns to its owner with all improvements and additions to its value. However, the owner must compensate the lessee for any useful expenses deemed as such by experts, subject to two conditions:

    a. That these expenses were incurred before the request for termination.
    b. That they are extant at the time of the property's return to its owner and are handed over with it.  Luxury expenses are not refundable.


2. To maintain the contract and request the sale of the property to recover what is due. If the proceeds from the sale are insufficient to cover the outstanding rent and losses, the lessee remains liable for the balance from his personal assets. If the sale price exceeds or falls short of the amount agreed upon by the contracting parties, the lessee has the right to claim a share of the surplus proportionate to his expenses and the increase in the property's value.

The lessor has the right to pursue anyone holding the property and has priority over other creditors in the proceeds of the sale to the extent of the rent and losses due to him.
