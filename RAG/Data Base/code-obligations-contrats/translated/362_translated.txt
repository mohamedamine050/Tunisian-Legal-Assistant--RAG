Renewal of the contract by substituting the subject matter of the old contract is permissible if the substitution constitutes a change to the original contract's essence, specifying a different place of performance, altering the form of the contract and its related terms such as the term and conditions of the contract, or its authentication.  However, such substitution does not constitute a contract renewal unless explicitly stated by both contracting parties.
