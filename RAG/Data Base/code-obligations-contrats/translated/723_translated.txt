If the consideration is in real estate or real estate rights, then the request for its rescission shall be entered in the registration register of the deed of the consideration as determined in the mortgage.

A formal mortgage is a contract by which the creditor acquires, on a property designated for the repayment of his debt, a real right; by virtue of which he may take precedence over ordinary creditors and creditors subsequent to him in rank in the recovery of his right from the price of that property, in whomever's hands it may be.
