Whoever is in charge of an animal is liable for any harm caused by it, even if it occurred after the animal escaped or went astray, unless one of the following two things is proven:

Firstly: That they took the necessary measures to guard it or to mitigate the harm.

Secondly: That the harm resulted from a fortuitous event, force majeure, or the act of the person who suffered the harm.  The harm [1]  is an injury occurring in violation of the law, affecting a person's body, mental or psychological health, honor, property, or reputation; [2] loss or damage to property, deprivation of comfort, or damage to physical well-being, reputation, or similar. - In crimes and quasi-crimes, harm is the actual loss suffered by the claimant, the necessary expenses they were or will be obliged to incur to repair the consequences of the act committed to their detriment, and also what they were deprived of within the normal limits of the consequences of that act.
