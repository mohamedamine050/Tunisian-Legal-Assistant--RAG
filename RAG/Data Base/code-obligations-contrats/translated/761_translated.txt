The lessor does not guarantee defects that are easily ascertainable unless he declares their absence.  Furthermore, there is no guarantee in the following cases:

Firstly: If the lessee knew at the time of the contract of the defects in the leased property or its lack of a desired description.

Secondly: If the lessee was informed of the defects.

Thirdly: If the lessor stipulated the non-guarantee of defects.
