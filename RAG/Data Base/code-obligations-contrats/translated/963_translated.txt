The borrower may assign all of his rights in the loan to another party, with or without consideration.  The validity of the assignment does not depend on the lender's consent; however, the borrower must inform the lender thereof by registered mail with acknowledgement of receipt and notification of delivery. If the lender has a valid reason to object to the assignment, he must raise it within sixty days following the date of the aforementioned letter.
