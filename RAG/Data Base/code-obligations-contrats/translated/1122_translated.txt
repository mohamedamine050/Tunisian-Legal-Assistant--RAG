If the agent performs an act exceeding his agency or contravenes the instructions received from his principal, he shall be liable for the consequences of his act to the extent of such excess. Based on this:

Firstly: If he sold for less than the price specified, or less than the prevailing market price if no price was specified, he shall be liable to pay the difference to the principal, unless he proves the impossibility of selling at the specified price and also proves that he thereby avoided a greater loss for his principal.

Secondly: If he bought for more than the price specified, the principal is not obliged to accept the purchase and may leave it to the agent, unless the agent agrees to pay the difference or the difference is insignificant in commerce.

Thirdly: If the purchased item does not conform to the type commissioned for purchase, the principal may reject it.

Fourthly: If the quantity purchased exceeds that commissioned for purchase, the principal is only bound by the quantity commissioned.

Fifthly: If he bought for cash what was commissioned to be bought on credit, the principal may refuse to accept it.
