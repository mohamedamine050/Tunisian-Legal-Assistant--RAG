Whoever acquired something in good faith is entitled to retain it until he is compensated for:

Firstly: What he expended for its preservation and maintenance.

Secondly: The expenses he incurred for its repair before the claim was made against him, to the extent that it increased its value. After the claim is made, only necessary expenses are considered, and no retention is allowed for luxury expenses.

Thirdly:  What is stipulated in other provisions of the law.
