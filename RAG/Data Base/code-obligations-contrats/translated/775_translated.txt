The second lessee is liable to the lessor to the extent of the amount owed by the first lessee at the time of the lessor's notice to the second lessee not to pay the first lessee, and to disregard any prior payments made to the first lessee, unless such advance payment is customary in the place and supported by dated evidence of payment.
