The debtor may recover what he has secured as long as the creditor has not accepted the security.

Security is a contract whereby the insurer undertakes to pay the insured or the beneficiary a sum of money, a periodic income, or any other financial compensation in the event of the occurrence of the insured event, in exchange for premiums or any other financial payment made by the insured to the insurer.

Then the debt is renewed with the privileges and mortgages previously assigned to it, and the liability of the remaining debtors obligated by it and the guarantors is not discharged.
