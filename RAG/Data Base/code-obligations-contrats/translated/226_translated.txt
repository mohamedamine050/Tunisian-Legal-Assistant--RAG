Settlement shall be legally effected in the following ways:

Firstly: A creditor, whether he holds a mortgage or his debt is evidenced only by a written instrument, shall be settled if another creditor's debt is paid ahead of him due to his privileges and mortgages, even if the latter's debt is older.

Secondly:  Similarly, a purchaser of real estate shall be settled up to the amount of the purchase price, if this price, agreed upon by the contracting parties, whether exceeding or falling short of the value of the property, is paid in discharge of the creditors to whom the property was mortgaged.

Thirdly: Settlement shall be granted to one who paid a debt in which he was jointly liable with the debtor, or which was claimed against him, whether he is a jointly and severally liable debtor, a guarantor for or with the debtor, or an agent acting on behalf of another.


Fourthly:  Settlement is granted to one who paid the debt for his own benefit, even if he was not liable for it, such as one who provided a mortgage for the debt of another.
