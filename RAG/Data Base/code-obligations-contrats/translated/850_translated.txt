There is no guarantee on the owners of the aforementioned places if they prove that the damage or defect occurred due to one of the following reasons:

First: That it arose from a gross act or negligence on the part of the owner of the goods, his servants, or those with him.

Second: That it arose from the nature of the thing that perished or was defective, or from a defect therein.

Third: That it was caused by force majeure or an unforeseen event not attributable to their negligence or the negligence of their agents, assistants, or servants.  The burden of proof rests with them in all of this, and they are not liable for any of their fees, documents, financial papers, valuables, and cash if these were not delivered to them or their agents.
