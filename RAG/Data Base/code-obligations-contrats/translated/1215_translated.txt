Upon the termination of the contract, the agent shall return to the principal his capital and his share of the profit.  The excess of the company's assets over its liabilities shall be included in the calculation of the company's capital at the end of the financial year. If the money was received by written instruments, his liability is discharged only by written instruments.  The estate of the agent is liable for his obligations, but the heirs are permitted to prove the return of the capital by any other means of proof.
