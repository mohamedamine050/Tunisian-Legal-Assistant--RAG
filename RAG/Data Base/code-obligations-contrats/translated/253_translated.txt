If performance is made by a debtor lacking capacity to alienate or to a creditor lacking capacity to receive, the following rules shall apply:

Firstly: If performance of the obligation is made by someone lacking the capacity to alienate, and this does not harm him, the obligation is thereby extinguished, and the payer cannot recover the payment from the creditor who received it.

Secondly: Performance to someone lacking capacity to act is valid if the debtor proves that the minor benefited therefrom within the meaning of Article 13.
