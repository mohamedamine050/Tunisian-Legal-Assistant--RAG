Each party may demonstrate the falsity of the oath of execution directed against their opponent.  However, this is not permitted in the following two instances:

Firstly: If a written judgment or decision is issued by the court resolving a legal issue or a question of fact,  the matter to which the oath relates is not subject to any form of appeal.

Secondly: If a party explicitly accepts the judgment ordering the oath of execution against their opponent.  Mere silence does not constitute acceptance.
