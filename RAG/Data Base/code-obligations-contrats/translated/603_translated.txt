All expenses related to the delivery of the sale, such as carriage, weighing, counting, and measuring, shall be borne by the seller. If the sale is an intangible right, the seller shall also bear the expenses of the fees necessary to prove that right or transfer it. All of this applies unless there is an agreement or custom to the contrary.
