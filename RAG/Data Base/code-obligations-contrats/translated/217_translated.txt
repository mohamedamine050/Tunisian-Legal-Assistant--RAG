The debtor may oppose the assignee with all the oppositions which he could have opposed to the assignor if these oppositions had a basis at the time of assignment or at the time of notification thereof.  However, he may not oppose the assignment on the grounds of delegation, nor by means of secret letters and agreements between him and the assignor which contradict the apparent terms of the transaction, if these agreements were not mentioned in the instrument of debt and were not known to the assignee.
