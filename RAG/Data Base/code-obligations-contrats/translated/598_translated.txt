The seller is not obligated to deliver the goods if the buyer delays payment of the price agreed upon by the contracting parties, whether it exceeds or falls short of the value of the goods, and no payment deadline was stipulated in the contract.

Furthermore, the offer of a guarantee or other security does not substitute for the payment of the price.
