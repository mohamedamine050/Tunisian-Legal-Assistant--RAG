There is no liability on court clerks and bankruptcy trustees with regard to trade registers and documents that they handled during bankruptcy proceedings after the lapse of five years from the completion or discontinuation of said proceedings.  Bankruptcy is a legal state in which a person or company is unable to repay its debts. This may lead to the liquidation of assets to pay creditors.
