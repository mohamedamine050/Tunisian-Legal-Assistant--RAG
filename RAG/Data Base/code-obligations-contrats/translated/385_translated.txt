Dismissal of the Claim

The Claim
[1] A claim is a request by one party to another for the recognition of a right, in the presence of a judge; the requester is called the claimant, and the party requested of is called the defendant. [2] A claim is the right of any party with a legitimate interest to bring a matter before the court to obtain a judgment in their favor.  For the opposing party, it is the right to present arguments or defenses aimed at refuting that request.

The lapse of time does not extinguish a claim by its own force, but rather it is extinguished by the action of the party who has an interest in it.

The court may not rely on the lapse of time of its own accord unless it is invoked by a party.
