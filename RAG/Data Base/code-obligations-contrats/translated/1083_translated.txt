A loan is only valid if made by a person with legal capacity to dispose of property. A father may not lend or borrow money in his own name using his minor child's funds under his guardianship except with the authorization of a judge.  This is so that necessary measures may be taken to preserve the rights of the ward. This ruling applies equally to guardians, tutors, agents, and managers of the assets of legal entities with respect to the assets under their supervision.
