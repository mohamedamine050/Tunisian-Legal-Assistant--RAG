If the currency mentioned in the contract refers to coins of different values in circulation, and doubt arises, the debtor is absolved from paying the debt in the coin of the lowest value.

However, if the debt in commercial contracts is specified as being in the most commonly circulated currency, and the types of currency are equal, the contract may be rescinded.
