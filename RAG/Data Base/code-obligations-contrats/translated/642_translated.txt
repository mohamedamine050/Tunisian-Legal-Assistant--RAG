The parties may agree that there is no warranty whatsoever on the seller.

However, this condition only serves to exempt the seller from compensating for the loss; as for the original price,  if what the contracting parties agreed upon exceeds or falls short of the value of the goods sold, then the excess or deficiency must be returned to the buyer, in whole or in part, if eviction occurs.

The condition of the seller's discharge is not effective:

First: If the eviction is based on something done by the seller himself.

Second: If the cause of the eviction is due to the seller's fraud, such as selling something that belongs to another, or something for which the seller knows the reason for eviction but did not inform the buyer.

In both cases, the seller is obligated to compensate for the loss.
