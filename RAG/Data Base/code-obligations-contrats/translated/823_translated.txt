The lessee may not dispose of the land in any manner that diminishes or delays the enjoyment of the subsequent user.  Therefore, it is not permissible for him to plough it for two months prior to the expiration of his lease term.  He must allow the subsequent user to commence preparatory work in due time after the harvest. All of this is subject to any prevailing local custom.
