If several persons have a right to an indivisible obligation and there is no joint ownership among them, the debtor may not pay anything except to all of them jointly, and each of them may not claim performance except on behalf of all and with their authorization. However, he may request, on their behalf, the securing of the obligated thing if possible; otherwise, its seizure under the authority of a person appointed by the court for that purpose.
