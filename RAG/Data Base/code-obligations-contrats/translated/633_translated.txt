The entitlement to a specific part is equivalent to the entitlement to the whole if that part is of such importance relative to the remainder that had the buyer known of it, he would not have agreed to the purchase.  This also applies if a non-apparent right of another owner or other rights not mentioned at the time of sale are found on the subject matter of the sale.
