(Amended by the order dated November 4, 1922). The judge may not grant an extension to a contracting party unless provided for by contract or law.  Nor may he extend the time limit stipulated by the contract or law unless authorized to do so by law.

However, except in the case of:
Recovery
Recovery
Recovery is the process by which the creditor obtains payment of the debt agreed upon from his debtor.  In the case of a debt owed to the state, municipality, or a public institution, a reasonable extension may be granted for the execution of the judgment, subject to taking significant precautions and avoiding significant harm to the creditor, when the debtor demonstrates that the said extension will facilitate repayment, for example, by allowing him to borrow money under better conditions than before, or when it is shown that non-performance is due to causes beyond his control.

This extension may not exceed one year and cannot be renewed.

The judge may authorize the debtor to pay his debt in successive installments.

The judgment must state the reason for granting the extension, which commences on the date of notification of the judgment.

The provisions of Article 149 of this law apply to the extension granted by the judge.
