The principal may revoke his agent's authority at any time, and any condition to the contrary between the contracting parties or against a third party shall be null and void.  The stipulation of remuneration shall not prevent the principal from revoking his agent's authority. However, if a right is vested in the agent or another person in relation to the agency, the principal may not revoke it except with the consent of the rights holder.  If the agent is appointed for litigation, the principal may not revoke his authority once the proceedings have commenced and are ready for judgment.
