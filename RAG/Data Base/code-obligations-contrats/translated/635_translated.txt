If a lawsuit, a legal action initiated by a plaintiff before a court against another party, which may be an individual or a private entity, claiming a right or compensation for a loss caused by that party, is directed against the buyer concerning the sale, and the plaintiff provides evidence, then the buyer must inform the seller. If the buyer wishes to proceed with the litigation and the judge informs him that his litigation prevents him from recourse against the seller, and he chooses to proceed with the litigation and actually litigates, he will have no further recourse against the seller.
