The total taxable income cannot be less than the estimated amount determined by applying the table contained in Annex 1 of this journal to certain elements of the standard of living of taxpayers, unless proven otherwise. This applies when there is a clear disparity between the taxpayer's standard of living and the income declared.

This clear disparity between the taxpayer's standard of living and the declared income is established when the estimated amount resulting from the application of the provisions of this paragraph exceeds the declared net total income by at least 40%, for the tax year and the previous year.

To apply the preceding provisions, the actual rental value is determined either based on written lease agreements or on oral lease declarations that have been proven to be registered, or by comparison with other properties whose rental value has been established or is generally known.

11. The elements taken into consideration in determining the tax base for the taxpayer include elements that are relevant to the persons considered to be in their care when they do not declare personal income. 

III. When the taxpayer possesses at least three, and simultaneously, elements indicative of their standard of living, the estimated income corresponding to the ownership of these elements is increased by 25%. 

This income is increased by 40% when the number of elements is four or more. 

IV. In the case of an estimated assessment, the income specifically exempted and the income of the spouse are deducted from the tax base determined in accordance with the aforementioned provisions.
