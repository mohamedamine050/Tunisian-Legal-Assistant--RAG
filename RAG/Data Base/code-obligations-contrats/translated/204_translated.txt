Contract

A contract is a legally binding agreement that obligates the contracting parties and defines their obligations and rights with respect to the specific transaction.

The assignment of a debt, right, or claim to the courts is complete when accepted by both parties, whereupon the assignee is subrogated to the assignor's rights from the date of assignment.
