Whoever possesses a movable thing or an immovable thing by way of possession, under the presumption that he owns it rightfully, the burden of proof lies upon anyone who claims otherwise to prove it.  He shall not be held liable based on suspicion if he had no knowledge or if he had no right to know, upon obtaining the movable thing, that the transferor did not have the right to dispose of it.
