It is not permissible to recover what has been paid in satisfaction of a debt extinguished by lapse of time or by a commendable but non-obligatory order, if the payment was made by one who has the power to make a gratuitous transfer, even if the payment was made under the belief that he was obligated to perform or out of ignorance of the debt's extinguishment.
