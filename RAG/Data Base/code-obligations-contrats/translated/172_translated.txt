What each of the joint creditors received in fulfillment or settlement.

Settlement [1]

A contract is a binding legal agreement that obligates the contracting parties and defines their obligations and rights concerning the specific transaction.  It is established to resolve the dispute and end the litigation, either by each of the settling parties waiving some of their claims or by the delivery of money or a right. [2]

A contract is a binding legal agreement that obligates the contracting parties and defines their obligations and rights concerning the specific transaction. It terminates an existing dispute or prevents a potential one, whereby each party reciprocally waives their right.

Each creditor shares in it according to their share. If one of the creditors receives a guarantor or assigns their share of the debt, the remaining creditors are entitled to share in what he receives, unless the contract or the nature of the case indicates otherwise.
