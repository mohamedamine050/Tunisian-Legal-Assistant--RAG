Payment must be made to the creditor himself, his duly authorized agent, or to the person designated by him to receive the debt. Payment to one who does not hold a power of attorney from the creditor to receive payment does not discharge the debtor's obligation except in the following two instances:

Firstly: If the creditor ratifies the payment, even by silence or benefiting from it.

Secondly: If the payment was made with the authorization of the judge.
