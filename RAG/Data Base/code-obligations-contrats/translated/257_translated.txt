A party obligated to perform a specific act is discharged from their obligation upon delivery of the thing in its condition at the time of the contract.  However, they remain liable for any defects arising thereafter in the following two instances:

Firstly: If the defect results from an act or omission attributable to them according to the rules stipulated in misdemeanor law and similar provisions.

Secondly: If they were in default and the defect occurred during their default.
