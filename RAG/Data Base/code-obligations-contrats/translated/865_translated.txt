If one of the contracting parties fails to fulfill their obligations or suddenly breaches the contract at an inappropriate time and without sufficient cause, the other party may claim compensation for the resulting losses.  This includes situations where an employee absconds before completing their service. If, after the expiry of the term, they claim wages for the period they worked, the employer may deduct the losses caused by the interruption of service and pay the remainder, if any. Similarly, if the breach of contract originates with the employer, they shall compensate the employee for the losses incurred.

The judge must assess the existence and significance of the damages, considering the nature of the service, the circumstances, and local custom.
