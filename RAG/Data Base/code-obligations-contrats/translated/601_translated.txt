The seller has the right to retain the goods sold, even if the price is payable to the buyer at a later date:

Firstly: If the buyer becomes insolvent after the sale.

Secondly: If the buyer was insolvent at the time of the sale and the seller was unaware of this.

Thirdly: If the buyer commits an act that justifies reducing the security given for the payment of the price,  where the price agreed upon by the contracting parties either exceeds or falls short of the value of the goods sold, and the seller consequently fears the loss of his right.
