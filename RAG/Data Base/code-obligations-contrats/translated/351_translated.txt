Discharge occurs through express waiver arising from an agreement or any contract.

A contract is a legally binding agreement that obligates the contracting parties and defines their obligations and rights regarding the specific transaction.  The contract guarantees the debtor's discharge from the debt or its gift to him.

It may also occur by silence, based on anything clearly indicating the creditor's intention to relinquish his right.

The creditor's voluntary return of the original instrument to the debtor implies a waiver of the debt.
