If the agent or the principal terminates the agency abruptly at an inappropriate time and without valid reason, then each of the agent or the principal may claim from the other compensation for any losses incurred, unless otherwise stipulated.

The proof and assessment of the loss are left to the discretion of the judge, who considers this according to the type of agency, the stages of the case, and local custom.
