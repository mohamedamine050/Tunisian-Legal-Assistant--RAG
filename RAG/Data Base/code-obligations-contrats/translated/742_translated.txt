The lessor shall deliver to the lessee the property leased to him, together with its appurtenances and accessories, and shall preserve its condition for the duration of the lease, such that it remains fit for the purpose for which it was intended, according to its type, unless the contract stipulates otherwise. In the lease of a quarter (fraction), minor repair expenses shall be borne by the lessee according to local custom.

If the lessor fails to undertake the repairs incumbent upon him in accordance with the foregoing, he shall be ordered to do so.  If he fails to comply, the lessee may undertake the repairs after obtaining authorization from the court, and the expenses thereof shall be deducted from the rent.
