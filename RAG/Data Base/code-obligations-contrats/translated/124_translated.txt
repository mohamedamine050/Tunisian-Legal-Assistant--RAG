If a person entitled to the right of rescission dies before the expiry of the term, the right of ratification or rescission passes to his heirs for the remaining period of their predecessor's term. If the heirs disagree, one heir who wishes to ratify the contract cannot compel the other heirs to do so; however, they may accept it entirely for their own individual shares.
