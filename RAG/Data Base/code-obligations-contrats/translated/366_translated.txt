The privileges and mortgages granted to the original debt are not transferred to the debt established in its place unless this is explicitly stipulated by the creditor in the contract.

The agreement to transfer them from the original debt to the second debt is not enforceable against third parties unless this occurs upon renewal of the contract and results from a written document with a verifiable date.
