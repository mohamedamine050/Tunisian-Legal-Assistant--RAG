If the debt is not fulfilled and the debtor is given notice, the creditor may obtain court authorization to sell the debtor's assets to recover the debt from the proceeds.  The price agreed upon by the contracting parties, whether exceeding or less than the value of the sale, takes precedence over other creditors. The creditor's recourse in the sale and its consequences are the same as those of a secured creditor in possession of the collateral.
