The intermeddler must attend to what he has undertaken with the care of a prudent person in his own affairs, and must pursue the intentions of the owner, whether known or presumed. He shall compensate for any negligence, however slight. However, if his intervention was to avert a significant anticipated harm or to complete the duties of an agency belonging to his predecessor, he shall only be liable for what arises from his gross negligence or serious omission.
