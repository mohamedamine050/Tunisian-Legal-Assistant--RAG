The sale of the property includes its appurtenances and the estimated costs of its establishment, as well as its title deeds.  If the aforementioned fees or title deeds relate to another ownership outside the sale, the seller is only obligated to provide the buyer with an official guarantee, an act possessing a governmental character according to established procedures, concerning what the buyer has purchased.
