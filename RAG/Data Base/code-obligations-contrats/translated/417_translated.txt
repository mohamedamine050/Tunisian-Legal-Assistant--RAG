Dismissal is invalid in the following two instances:

Firstly: If the subject matter of the contract is nonexistent, defective, or altered due to manufacturing.

Secondly: If it is impossible for both parties, due to another reason, to return everything received from each other, unless both parties agree in these two instances to compensate for the difference.
