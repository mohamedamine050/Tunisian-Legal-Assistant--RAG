If the commitment is not signed or ratified explicitly, its execution in whole or in part by those aware of its defects is sufficient, after the time when the contract could have been validly signed or ratified.  The signing of the commitment, its acknowledgment, or its optional execution in the manner and at the time specified by law necessitates the relinquishment of any possible remedies or objections against the voidable commitment.  As for rights acquired by a third party legally and in good faith before the ratification of the contract or its execution, the rule stipulated in Article 336 shall apply.
