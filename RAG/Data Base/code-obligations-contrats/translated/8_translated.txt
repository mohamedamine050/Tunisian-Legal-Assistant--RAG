The gross net income forming the tax base consists of the positive difference between the gross yield, including the value of gains and in-kind benefits, and the burdens and expenses incurred in obtaining and retaining income.

This gross net income is composed of the sum of the net incomes adjusted individually according to the specific rules for each type of income as follows:

- Industrial and commercial profits,

- Profits from non-commercial professions,

- Profits from agricultural and fishing activities,

- Salaries, wages, grants, pensions, and life annuities,

- Real estate income,

- Income from securities and movable capital,

- Other income.

The income adjusted in this manner takes into account the loss incurred by one type of income as demonstrated by accounting compliant with the accounting legislation for institutions. If the gross income is not sufficient to cover the entire loss, the remaining portion is deducted consecutively from the gross income of the following years within a limit of “five years” (*) from the year of entry.

This deduction does not include losses resulting from the deduction of income or profits according to the tax legislation currently in effect. (Added by Article 37-2 of Tax Code No. 1 of 2012 dated May 16, 2012).

Losses that were not deducted under the heading of the years recorded for income and subsequent to the year of recording the losses are not accepted for deduction within the limits of realized income. (Amended by Article 31 of Tax Code No. 101 of 2002 dated December 17, 2002).
