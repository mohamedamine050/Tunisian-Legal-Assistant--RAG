Delivery is effected in various ways:

Firstly: In immovable property, by the seller vacating it, and in a quarter (of a building), by vacating it and handing over its keys to the purchaser, provided that the purchaser encounters no impediment in possessing what he has purchased.

Secondly: In movables, by handing over from hand to hand, or by handing over the key to the premises or container in which they are located, or in any manner customary and usual in delivery.

Thirdly: By the mere agreement of the contracting parties if the delivery of the goods requires preparation, or if the purchaser has otherwise taken possession of them.

Fourthly: If the goods are located in a public warehouse, the transfer of the warehouse receipt or bill of lading or transport document, or the delivery of the said receipt itself to the purchaser, shall be considered as delivery of the goods themselves.
