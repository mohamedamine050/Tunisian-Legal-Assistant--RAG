The custodian guarantees the loss or damage of the deposit, even due to unforeseen circumstances or force majeure, if he disposes of it without the depositor's permission, such as lending it or riding the animal.  Similarly, if he trades with it without permission, he is liable even for unforeseen circumstances and force majeure. In such a case, the profit – the amount exceeding the company's assets over its liabilities by including the company's capital within the debts owed at the end of the fiscal year – shall belong to him. However, if he only disposed of part of the deposit, his guarantee shall be limited to the portion he disposed of.
