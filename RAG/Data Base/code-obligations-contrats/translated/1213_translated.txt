What the worker is entitled to in expenses and his share of the profits is not considered a debt owed by the owner of the capital, but rather considered part of the Qard (loan) capital.  If the capital is lost or is insufficient to cover what the worker is entitled to, he has no claim whatsoever against the owner of the capital.
