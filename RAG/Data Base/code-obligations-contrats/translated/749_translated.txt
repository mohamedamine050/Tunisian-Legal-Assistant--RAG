The lessee may not prevent the lessor from undertaking urgent repairs that cannot be delayed. However, if these repairs result in the lessee being deprived of the use of the entire leased property or the greater part thereof for more than three days, the lessee may request termination of the lease or a reduction in the rent for the period of disuse.  The lessor must prove the urgency of the aforementioned repairs and must inform the lessee thereof before commencing the repairs; otherwise, the lessor shall be liable for any losses incurred due to the failure to provide such notification.
