The buyer may not return the price, the price agreed upon by the contracting parties, whether it exceeded or fell short of the value of the sale or part thereof, if he is unable to return the sale in the following cases:

Firstly: If the sale perished due to unforeseen circumstances, the buyer's negligence, or the negligence of someone for whose actions he is responsible.

Secondly: If the sale was stolen from the buyer or lost by him.

Thirdly: If the buyer altered its form and rendered it unsuitable for the purpose for which it was intended; however, if its defect only appeared upon alteration, the buyer may resort to the seller.
