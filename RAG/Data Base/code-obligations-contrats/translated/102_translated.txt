If a person, while in a state of intoxication, commits a misdemeanor described as a crime punishable by imprisonment exceeding fifteen days but not exceeding five years, or by a fine exceeding sixty dinars, or a similar punishment, this does not prevent the recovery of losses resulting from his act if his intoxication was voluntary.  If his intoxication was involuntary, he bears no financial liability, and the burden of proof lies with him.
