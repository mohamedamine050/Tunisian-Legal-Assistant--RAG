If the debtor fulfills his obligation, he is entitled to the return of the promissory note after the creditor signs a receipt acknowledging its discharge. If the return of the promissory note is not possible, or if the creditor has a legally acceptable interest in retaining it, the debtor may request a certificate of discharge attested by credible witnesses, with the expenses thereof borne by him.
