Every claim is a legal procedure initiated by a plaintiff before the court against another party, which may be an individual or a private entity, in which the plaintiff demands a right or compensation for a loss caused by the defendant.  Claims arising from enrichment without cause are not admissible after the lapse of fifteen years, except as otherwise exempted or provided for by law in specific instances.
