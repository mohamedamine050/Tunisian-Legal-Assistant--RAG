If a debt is jointly owed by several persons and is divisible, its divisibility is not considered in the following instances:

Firstly: If the object of the debt is a specific thing in the possession of one of the debtors.

Secondly: If one of the debtors is designated by drawing of lots or by subsequent agreement to perform the obligation alone.  In both instances, the debtor in possession of the specific thing or the one assigned to execute the contract is liable for the entire debt, and has recourse against his co-debtors if necessary.
