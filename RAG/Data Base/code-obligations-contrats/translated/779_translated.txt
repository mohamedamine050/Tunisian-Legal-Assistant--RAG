The lessee shall return the leased property upon expiry of the term specified in the contract; otherwise, he shall be liable for the rent of the additional period, as determined by experts.

The expertise shall cover scientific and technical matters, and other matters necessary for the adjudication of the legal case, excluding legal issues.

If the leased property is destroyed or becomes defective while in his possession during the additional period, even due to unforeseen circumstances, he shall be liable for its compensation, and no rent shall be due in that case.
