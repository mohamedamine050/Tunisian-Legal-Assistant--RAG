If the farm manager is a partner with the farm owner, possessing livestock while the farm owner possesses between five and ten head of livestock, then the manager is not entitled to any remuneration unless a contrary stipulation exists between them, and the rental of his livestock and their expenses are borne by the farm owner.

However, if the farm owner possesses less than five head of livestock, then the farm manager is obligated to bear the rental of his livestock and their expenses.
