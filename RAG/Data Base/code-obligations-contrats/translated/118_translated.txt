Any condition that would prevent or restrict a person from exercising his human rights, such as the right to marry and exercise his civil rights, is void, and the contract is thereby rendered void.  This ruling does not apply if a person undertakes not to engage in a specific trade or profession in a particular place or for a specific period.
