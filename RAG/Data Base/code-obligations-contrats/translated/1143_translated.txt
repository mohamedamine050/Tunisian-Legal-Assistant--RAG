The agent shall not be entitled to remuneration in the following instances:

Firstly: If he was prevented by force majeure from performing the mandate.

Secondly: If the transaction was terminated before he commenced performance.

Thirdly: If the object of the mandate was not achieved, unless otherwise provided for by commercial custom or local usage.

However, the court may consider his entitlement to remuneration in light of the circumstances, particularly if the matter was not completed due to a reason attributable to the principal or due to an unforeseen event.
