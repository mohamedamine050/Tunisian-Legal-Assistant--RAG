It is not permissible for the judge to authorize a party to inspect the commercial books of his opponent, his inventory of goods, and the private ledgers of his home except in cases related to inheritances and companies, and in other situations where the ledgers are shared between the parties, and in cases of bankruptcy.

The judge may authorize a party to inspect the aforementioned ledgers either on his own initiative or at the request of one of the parties during or before the dispute, subject to two conditions: the existence of necessity and the assessment of the inspection to its extent.
