If the agent receives things on behalf of his principal and they are damaged or show signs of damage, he must take all necessary steps to preserve his principal's rights against the carrier and others who are liable.

The agent is a worker who works for wages.

If the damage accelerates or appears later before the principal can be informed, the agent must sell them through the court after proving their condition and immediately informing his principal of all his actions.
