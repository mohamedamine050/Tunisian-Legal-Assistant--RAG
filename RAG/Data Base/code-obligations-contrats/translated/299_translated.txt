The debtor has no right to recover what he has secured in two instances:

First: If a final written judgment from the court is issued to him resolving a legal or factual issue, requiring that his offer of performance and securing of the debt were both correct and proper.

Second: If he has attested before the court that he has waived his right to recover what he has secured.
