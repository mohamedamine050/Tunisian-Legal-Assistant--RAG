## English Translation:

The following entities are exempt from corporate tax within the scope of their social purpose:

1. Professional associations that do not primarily engage in profit-making activities. 
(Note:  The Arabic text repeats the word "profit" twice, which may indicate a legal emphasis. This repetition has been maintained in the English translation).
(Note: "القدر الزائد مما للشركة على ما بذمتها بإدخال رأس مال الشركة في ضمن الديون المترتبة عليها عند نهاية السنة المالية" translates to "the excess of a company's assets over its liabilities, including the company's capital, at the end of the fiscal year.") 
Entities that have revenues from a taxable or quasi-taxable source.

2. [Repealed by Article 28-1 of Law No. 66 of 2017 dated December 18, 2017].

7. Labor production mutuals.

8. Funds for loans and assistance to local communities. (Added by Article 62 of Law No. 125 of 1993 dated December 27, 1993). (Note: "القروض" is translated as "loans" as it is clear from the context that this refers to a specific amount of money provided by a bank.)

(Added by Article 5 of Law No. 88 of 1995 dated October 30, 1995 concerning special tax provisions for investment companies and amended by Article 94 of Law No. 123 of 2001 dated December 28, 2001).
