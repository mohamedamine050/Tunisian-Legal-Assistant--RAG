The buyer shall receive the goods on the date and at the place agreed upon in the contract. If the contract is silent on this matter and there is no established custom, the buyer shall receive the goods immediately, taking into account any reasonable delay.  If the buyer is late or present but does not pay the price, and the sale was for cash, the judgment shall be rendered in accordance with the principles established by law in Article 597 concerning the debtor's default.

If the contract stipulates the delivery of the goods in installments, the buyer's delay in receiving the first installment shall be considered as a delay in receiving the whole.

All of the foregoing is subject to any contrary agreement between the contracting parties.
