If the rent becomes due, the entitled party has the right to enforce the lease or to terminate it. If the entitled party chooses termination, they are not permitted to evict the lessee except after giving notice and observing the stipulated deadlines, if acting in good faith.  The entitled party is not entitled to recover the rent paid and losses arising therefrom except from the lessor.
