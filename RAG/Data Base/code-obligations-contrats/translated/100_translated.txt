Neighbors are not permitted to remove the harm.

[1] Harm is an injury caused in violation of the law, affecting a person's body, mental or psychological health, honor, property, or reputation. [2] Harm also includes loss or damage to property, deprivation of comfort, impairment of physical well-being, reputation, or similar matters. In crimes and quasi-crimes, harm is the loss actually suffered by the claimant, the necessary expenses incurred or to be incurred to repair the consequences of the harmful act, and also what the claimant has been deprived of within the normal limits of the consequences of this act.

Harm arising typically from proximity, such as smoke from chimneys and similar unavoidable nuisances, provided they do not exceed the usual limit, is included.
