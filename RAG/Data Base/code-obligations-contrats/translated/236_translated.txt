Assignment does not discharge the assignor's liability, and the assignee retains the right to recourse against the assignor for the entire assigned amount and its appurtenances in the following instances:

First: If the assigned debt is extinguished or annulled because the law mandates its rescission or nullification.

Second: In the instances stipulated in Articles 365 and 366.

Third: If the assignee proves that he fulfilled the debt before knowledge of the assignment, and if he paid something to the assignor after knowledge of the assignment, he remains liable to the assignee, provided that he can recover what he paid from the assignor.
