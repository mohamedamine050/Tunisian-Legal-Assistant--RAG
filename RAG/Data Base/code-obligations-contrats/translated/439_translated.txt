The confession shall not be relied upon in the following cases:

Firstly: If it relates to something impossible in fact or if the contrary is proven by irrefutable evidence.

Secondly: If the confessor retracts it explicitly.

Thirdly: If its consequence is to enrich oneself unjustly or to prove a matter contrary to law or good morals, or to prove a matter which the law does not permit to be done, or to evade a written judgment of a court that resolves a legal issue or a question of fact.

Fourthly: If a final written judgment of a court resolving a legal issue or a question of fact has been issued and it shows a contradiction with what the confession implies.
