It is not permissible to divide a confession such that the confessor is held accountable for part of it but not the whole, if it is the sole evidence.  However, its division is permissible in the following instances:

Firstly: If another piece of evidence proves one of the matters to which the confession relates.

Secondly: If the confession relates to separate matters distinct from one another.

Thirdly: If it is shown that part of the confession is invalid, as per Article 439.

It is not permissible to retract a confession unless it is proven that the person making it was subject to a sensory mistake. A mistake regarding the principle of the right itself does not constitute grounds for retracting the confession unless it is excusable or resulted from the other partyâ€™s deceit.  There is no retraction of a confession, even if the opposing party did not witness it.
