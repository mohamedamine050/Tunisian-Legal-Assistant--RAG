If the goods are damaged or defective before delivery due to the seller's act or negligence, the seller is liable to the buyer for the value of the goods or the amount by which their value has been diminished, as if the damage or defect were caused by a third party. If the goods are generic, the seller is obligated to deliver a replacement of the same quantity and quality, while the buyer retains the right to claim compensation for any proven losses.
