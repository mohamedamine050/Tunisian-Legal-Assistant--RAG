If the impounded thing is of a changeable nature or liable to deterioration, the creditor may request authorization to sell it in the manner prescribed for the sale of a mortgage.

A formal mortgage is a contract whereby the creditor acquires, over a property designated to satisfy his debt, a proprietary right which enables him to take precedence over ordinary creditors and those subsequent to him in rank in recovering his right from the proceeds of that property, in whosever hands it may be.  The right of seizure shall apply to the proceeds of the sale.
