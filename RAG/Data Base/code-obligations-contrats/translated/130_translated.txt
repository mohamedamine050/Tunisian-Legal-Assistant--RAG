The resolutive condition does not suspend the performance of the obligation, but rather obliges the creditor to return what he has received upon the occurrence of the condition. If he is unable to return it for a reason that makes him liable, then he is obligated to compensate for the loss; however, he is not obligated to return his profit and any increase in value. If the aforementioned return was stipulated as a condition, then the condition is void and of no effect.
