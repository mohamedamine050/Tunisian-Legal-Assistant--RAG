(Amended by Law No. 36 of 2016 dated April 29, 2016). - Bankruptcy of a Tenant

Tenant

A tenant is a worker who works in return for wages.

The bankruptcy of the landlord does not result in the termination of the lease; rather, the bankruptcy trustee replaces the debtor in his rights and obligations. However, this rule does not apply if one of the conditions of the contract relates to the specific characteristics of the tenant.
