If an officious intermeddler acts in a manner beneficial to the right holder, all rights arising from his actions shall belong to the owner of the thing.  The owner is directly liable to the party with whom the officious intermeddler contracted, for everything the intermeddler undertook.  Furthermore, the owner must directly indemnify the party from the consequences of the intermeddler's actions and compensate him for any previous expenditures, disbursements, and losses, in accordance with Article 1142.

The acts of the officious intermeddler shall be considered valid, regardless of their nature, if the undertaking was appropriate to the circumstances and constituted sound management.
