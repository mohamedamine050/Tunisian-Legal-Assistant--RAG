The debtor's delay does not suffice for the discharge of the debtor's obligation. Rather, if the debt is a sum of money, the debtor must actually offer it to the creditor. If the creditor refuses to receive it, the debtor's obligation is discharged by depositing it in the place designated by the court for the safekeeping of deposits. If the debt is a specific object or a thing that is consumed by use, the debtor must call upon the creditor to receive it at the place specified in the contract or that which is required by the nature of that thing. If the creditor refuses to receive it, the debtor's obligation is not discharged except by depositing it in the warehouse designated by the court, if that thing is insurable, the enforcement authority shall be responsible.
