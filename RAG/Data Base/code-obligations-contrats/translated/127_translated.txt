If the permissible obligation is conditional upon the non-occurrence of an event within a specified period, and that event does not occur until the expiration of the period, the condition is considered fulfilled.  The condition is also considered fulfilled if it becomes certain, even before the expiry of the period, that the event will not occur. If no period is specified, the condition is not deemed fulfilled unless it becomes certain that the event will not occur.
