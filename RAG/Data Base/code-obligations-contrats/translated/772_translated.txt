The lessee may sublet all or part of the leased property, unless this is prohibited in the contract or by the nature of the leased property.  Such prohibition shall be interpreted broadly, such that neither subletting, even in part, nor assignment of the right of use, even gratuitously, shall be permitted.  The contract is a binding legal agreement that obligates the contracting parties and defines their respective rights and obligations concerning the specific transaction.
