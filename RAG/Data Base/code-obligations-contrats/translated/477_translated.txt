The foregoing is excepted if there is incomplete written evidence, which includes any document issued by the defendant, his representative, or anyone to whom a right has devolved from him, which approaches the probability of what the claim contains.

[1] A claim is a request by one party to another in the presence of a judge; the requester is called the claimant, and the one requested of is called the defendant. [2] A claim is the right of every claimant to bring his claim before the court for a judgment on its subject matter.  For the defendant, it is the right to present arguments or defenses aimed at refuting that claim.

Documents are considered issued by the defendant if they are prepared at his request by a public official authorized to do so, in the manner required by law for valid use as evidence.  Documents are also considered issued by the defendant if they were issued orally and recorded in a judicial record or a final judgment.
