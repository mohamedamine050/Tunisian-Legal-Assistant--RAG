The divisible obligation between the creditor and the debtor shall be performed as if it were indivisible, as per Article 255.

Divisibility shall only be considered with respect to the joint obligors who may not claim payment of a divisible debt except to the extent of their respective shares.

This rule applies to heirs; that is, they may neither claim nor be required to pay except to the extent of their respective shares in the estate of their predecessor.
