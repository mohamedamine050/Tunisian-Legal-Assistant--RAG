The sale by a person during their terminal illness is governed by:

**Article 354:** If the sale is to an heir and shows favoritism, such as selling to them for less than the agreed price—that which the contracting parties mutually agreed upon—exceeding or falling short of the usual market price, then [the sale is subject to judicial review].

**Article 355:** If the sale is to a non-heir, then [the sale is subject to judicial review].
