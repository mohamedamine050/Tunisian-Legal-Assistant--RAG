If the lessee sublets or assigns the leased property to another, he remains guarantor to the lessor for the performance of all obligations undertaken in the contract.  His guarantee is released only under the following two circumstances:

Firstly: If the lessor receives the rent from the second lessee or the assignee directly, without the intervention of the first lessee, and retains no further right of action against him.

Secondly: If the lessor expressly accepts the subletting or assignment and retains no further right of action against the lessee.
