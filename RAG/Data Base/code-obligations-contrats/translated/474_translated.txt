(Amended by Law No. 57 of 2000, dated June 13, 2000)

Witness testimony is not admissible between contracting parties to contradict the contents of written documents or to prove matters not contained therein, even if the amount involved is less than one thousand dinars.

This rule is excepted where the purpose is to clarify ambiguous or complex clauses in written documents, to determine their meaning, and to prove their implementation.
