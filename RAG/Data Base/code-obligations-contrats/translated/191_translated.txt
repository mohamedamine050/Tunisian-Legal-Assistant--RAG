The obligation is indivisible in the following two instances:

Firstly: If the indivisibility stems from the nature of the object of the obligation, whether it be a thing or an act that is indivisible in reality or in essence.

Secondly: If the indivisibility stems from the contract or the law, in that one of them requires that the obligation is not performed in part without the whole.
