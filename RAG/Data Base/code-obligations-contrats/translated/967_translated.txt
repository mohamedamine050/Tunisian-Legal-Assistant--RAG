The borrower shall pay the installment at the times stipulated in the contract or determined by custom.  He shall not withhold payment on the grounds of interference in his dealings, deficiency in the property's area, or recourse to warranty where legally required.  However, the court may authorize him to secure the installment in the designated fund if the circumstances warrant it.
