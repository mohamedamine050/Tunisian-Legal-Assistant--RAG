The buyer has no right to rescind the sale; however, he may request a reduction in the price agreed upon by the contracting parties, whether it exceeds or falls short of the value of the goods, in two cases:

Firstly: If the goods are defective due to the fault of the seller or someone for whom he is responsible.

Secondly: If the goods were used in a manner that significantly diminishes their value, if such use occurred before discovering the defect.  If the use occurred after discovering the defect, its ruling is as stated in Article 671.
