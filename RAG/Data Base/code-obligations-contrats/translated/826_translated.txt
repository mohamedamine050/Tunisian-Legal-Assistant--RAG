The lessee shall, upon expiry of the lease term, return what he received pursuant to the descriptive inventory, and he is required to do so, unless an unforeseen event occurs that is not attributable to his negligence or a defect arises due to ordinary use.  If the lessee, during the lease term, replaces what was damaged or repairs what was defective, he is entitled to reimbursement from the lessor, unless this was caused by his negligence.
