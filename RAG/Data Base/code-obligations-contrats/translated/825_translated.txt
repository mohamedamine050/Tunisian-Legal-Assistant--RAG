If a lessee rents land containing fodder, feed, and manure, he is obligated to leave behind, upon the expiration of his lease, a quantity equivalent to that which he received.  He may not excuse himself by claiming unforeseen circumstances.  Similarly, the lessor may retain from the aforementioned items a quantity sufficient to compensate him at the current market price, even if the lessee did not receive all of these items, unless local custom dictates otherwise.
