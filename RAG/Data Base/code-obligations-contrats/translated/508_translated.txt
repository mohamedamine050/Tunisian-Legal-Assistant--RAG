The judge may administer an oath of clarification to one or both parties to resolve the case.

[1] A claim is a request by one party for their right from another in the presence of the judge; the requester is called the plaintiff and the one requested from is called the defendant. [2]  A claim is the right of anyone entitled to request a judicial ruling on their claim.  With respect to the defendant, it is the right to present defenses or arguments aimed at refuting that claim or determining the amount of the judgment.  An oath may be administered.

The oath administered by one party to another to settle the dispute between them, if the legally permissible evidence to prove their claim is lacking, relying on the conscience, integrity, and religious duty of that party, may be administered.  The oath is administered concerning matters specific to the party or matters within their knowledge.
