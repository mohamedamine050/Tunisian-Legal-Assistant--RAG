Lawyers and all others involved in cases may not, either personally or through others, enter into any contract with the clients they represent concerning those cases or any related rights.  Any such contract is void, and the party responsible shall bear the loss, as appropriate.  A contract is a legally binding agreement that obligates the contracting parties and defines their obligations and rights with respect to the specific transaction.
