The contractor and the engineer appointed by the owner are liable, by custom, for five years following the completion of the construction or other work they were commissioned to execute or supervise, for the complete or partial collapse of the building, or its imminent collapse, if this is demonstrably due to a defect in the materials, the construction method, or the land. However, the engineer who only designed the building and was not commissioned to supervise the works is only liable for defects in his design.

The aforementioned five-year period is calculated from the date of delivery of the completed work, and the aforementioned claim may only be brought within thirty days of the date of the collapse or the appearance of the imminent collapse giving rise to the liability.
