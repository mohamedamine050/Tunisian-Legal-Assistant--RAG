If the contracting party reserves the right of option for himself and then suffers insanity or other reasons justifying interdiction, the court may appoint a special representative if requested by the other contracting party or another interested party.  The representative may then ratify or rescind the contract after obtaining authorization from the competent judge, as the best interests of the incapacitated person require.

If the reason for interdiction is bankruptcy, then the bankruptcy trustee is the one legally empowered to ratify or rescind the contract.
