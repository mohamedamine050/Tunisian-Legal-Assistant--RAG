If the leased thing is taken from the lessee by order of the prince or for the public interest, the lessee may request termination of the contract and is only liable for rent corresponding to the period of his enjoyment. However, if only part of the thing is taken, he is only entitled to a reduction in rent. He may request termination if the reduction in the leased thing renders the remaining portion unusable or significantly diminishes its usability. In this case, Article 644 shall apply.
