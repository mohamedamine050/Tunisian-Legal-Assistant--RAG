The debtor is not required to tender performance in the following two instances:

Firstly: If the creditor has declared that he does not accept performance of the obligation.

Secondly: If the creditor's participation is necessary for the performance of the obligation and he withholds it, as in the case of performance of the debt at the debtor's place of business and the creditor does not come. In both instances, the debtor's mere invitation to the creditor substitutes for actual tender.
