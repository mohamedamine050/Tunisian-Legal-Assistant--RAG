The informal date of the books is considered valid between the contracting parties, their heirs, and those who have acquired rights from them, specifically and on behalf of their debtor.

However, the aforementioned date shall not be binding on third parties except from the following dates:

1. From the date of registration of the books in Tunisia or in foreign countries.

2. From the date of deposit of the books with a public official (such as a notary, etc.).

3. From the date of death or from the date of permanent incapacity if the person who signed the document, either as a contracting party or as a witness, has died or become physically incapable of writing.

4. From the date of access to the books or from the date of their identification by a duly authorized public official or a judge in Tunisia or in foreign countries.

5. From the date of inclusion of the books in the document drawn up by a duly authorized public official in Tunisia or in foreign countries.

6. If the date results from other data that lead to full proof.  Anyone who has acquired a right from one of the parties specifically shall be considered a third party with regard to the content of this section if his claim is not based on the right of his debtor.
