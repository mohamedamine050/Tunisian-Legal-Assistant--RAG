Price

Price

That which the contracting parties have agreed upon, whether it exceeds or falls short of the value of the sale.  The price upon which the sale is concluded is binding; therefore, it is not valid to say "I sold or bought for what so-and-so will determine" or "for the same price as so-and-so bought," unless the price is known to the contracting parties at the time of sale. It is permissible to rely on what is determined by a market list or a specific tariff, or on the average market prices if the price of the sale is not variable. If it is variable, the contracting parties are deemed to have relied on the actual average price.
