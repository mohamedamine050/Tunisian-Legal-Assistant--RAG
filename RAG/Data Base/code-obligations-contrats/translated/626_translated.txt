If the sale is in bulk or of a specific item, and its quantity is specified in the contract by measure, number, or weight, then the seller cannot demand an increase in the price agreed upon by the contracting parties, whether it exceeds or falls short of the value of the sale.  If it appears that the quantity of the item sold exceeds the quantity specified in the contract, neither can the buyer demand a reduction in the price agreed upon by the contracting parties, whether it exceeds or falls short of the value of the sale.  If the sale shows the opposite, this is only applicable if the difference, whether an increase or decrease, does not exceed one-twentieth. This condition applies unless it contradicts customary practice or the seller and buyer have agreed otherwise.
