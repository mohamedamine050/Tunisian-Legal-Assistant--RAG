If an heir of the depositary in a deposit, whether for consideration or otherwise, misses (fails to account for) the deposit while being unaware that it was a deposit, the depositor may demand the specific object of the deposit from the person in whose possession it is.  Alternatively, the depositor may choose to claim its value from the heir who missed (failed to account for) it. If the heir's failure to account for the deposit was intentional, he remains liable for any losses caused thereby.
