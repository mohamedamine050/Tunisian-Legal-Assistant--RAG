A confession may be judicial or non-judicial.  A judicial confession is an acknowledgment made before a court by a party or their authorized agent in that respect.  A judicial confession, as issued by a judge, is not subject to review in the case, or during another case.  A judicial decision is a written decision from the court that resolves a legal issue or fact.  [1] A claim is a request by one party for their rights from another party in the presence of a judge; the requestor is called the claimant and the respondent is called the defendant. [2] A claim is the right of any party with a claim to bring it before the court for a ruling on its subject matter.  It is, for the defendant, the right to present reasons for defense or arguments aimed at refuting that claim.
