The court may, of its own motion during the proceedings, authorize the presentation of trade registers and other letters and documents held by one of the parties or by both parties, to extract therefrom what relates to the dispute or to examine their system.  It may also authorize, for the aforementioned purpose, the presentation of the broker's daily register that handled the transaction.

If it is necessary for the party to examine what is mentioned above, he may only examine that which relates to the dispute, in the portion designated by the judge from the aforementioned documents.

The presentation of the registers shall be either at the hearing, or at their location, or to the judge himself, or to the court clerk, or to the appointed bailiff.  If there is no dispute regarding the system of the registers or the evidence to be examined, a copy thereof may be taken by the court clerk or by a bailiff.
