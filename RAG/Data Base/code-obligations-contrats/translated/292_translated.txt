The debtor is also exempted from the obligation of actual performance, and his liability is discharged by securing his debt in the following two instances:

Firstly: If the identity of the creditor is unestablished or unknown.

Secondly: In all cases where it is impossible for the debtor to fulfill his obligation due to fear or other causes attributable to the creditor, as in the case of a disputed or contested debt, or a debt assigned to another party.
