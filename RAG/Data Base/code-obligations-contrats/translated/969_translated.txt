If the borrowers are multiple, the lender may only claim from each of them the amount disbursed to that borrower, unless solidarity is stipulated in the contract between them.

If one of them is late in paying his share, the lender may request the termination of the contract or the sale of the entire property to all of them, even if a guarantee of the option was not stipulated. In this case, the remaining borrowers may halt the sale or termination by offering the lender the amount owed by the defaulting borrower on the day they halt the proceedings, provided that they can recover from their partner in the obligation what they paid on his behalf, as determined in the case of unauthorized actions in Chapter III of Title VII.
