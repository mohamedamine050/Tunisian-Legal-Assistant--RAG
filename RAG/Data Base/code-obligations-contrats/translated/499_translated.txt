A child is not permitted to administer an oath.

The oath, which one party to a dispute administers to the other party to resolve the dispute between them when lacking the evidence permitted by law to prove their claim, relying on the conscience, integrity, and religious duty of that party, is not administered by a child's parents, but rather they may challenge it on his behalf if they deem necessary.
