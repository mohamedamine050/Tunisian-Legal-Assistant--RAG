If the sale is by measure, weight, count, description, on a trial basis, or subject to tasting the goods, then the goods sold remain under the guarantee of the seller, even if they have come into the possession of the buyer, unless they have been measured, weighed, counted, tried, tasted, or tested and accepted by the buyer or their representative.
