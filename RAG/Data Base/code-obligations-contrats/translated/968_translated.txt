A lessee of agricultural land may not request a reduction or waiver of the agreed rent on the grounds of non-profitability due to a temporary or other reason, unless a portion of the land is lost, resulting in a significant reduction in yield, or the land becomes unsuitable for its intended purpose. In such a case, the rent shall be reduced proportionally to the loss.  In this situation, the lessee is entitled to exercise the right granted to him under Article 970.
