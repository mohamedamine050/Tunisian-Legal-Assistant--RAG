(Amended by Law No. 23 of 1957, dated September 25, 1957).

The rent paid in advance each year is subject to increase or decrease after every five years, according to any increase or decrease in the value of the property itself during that period, equaling or exceeding one-third of the previous value. This is irrespective of any improvements made by the lessee of the property.  If the increase in value stems from the property itself, meaning that the surrounding lands of the same type have increased in value irrespective of any improvements made by the lessee, then the latter is obligated to bear the increase in value according to an appraisal conducted by experts, while reserving the right for the court to make a final determination in case of dispute. There is no need to assess the rent every five years if that value remains as it was at the time of its determination and if the interested party does not submit a request to that effect.

In the event of lesion (unjust enrichment), the right to claim the difference between the amount actually paid and the true value lapses after five years.
