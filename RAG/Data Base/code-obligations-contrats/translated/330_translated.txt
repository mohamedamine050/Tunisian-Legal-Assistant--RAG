Rescission may be effected in the circumstances set forth in Articles 8, 43, 58, and 61 of this Law.  The right to do so lapses after one year, unless a different period is specified by law. The lapse of the claimâ€¦the claim [1] is a request by one party for a right from another in the presence of a judge; the requester is called the plaintiff and the requested party is called the defendant. [2] A claim is the right of any claimant to bring a matter before the court for judgment on its subject matter.  With respect to the opposing party, it is the right to present reasons for defense or arguments aimed at refuting that request.  The lapse of time does not affect the judgment except in cases where a commitment exists between the parties.
