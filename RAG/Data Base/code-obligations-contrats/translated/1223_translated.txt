If the worker dies before realizing any profit, the surplus of the company's assets over its liabilities, determined by including the company's capital among its debts at the end of the fiscal year, shall then be inherited by his heirs, if they have legal capacity.  They may complete what he began or choose a trustee. If they do not appoint a trustee, they have no right to complete the work, and in that case, the owner of the capital shall assume the position of the worker.
