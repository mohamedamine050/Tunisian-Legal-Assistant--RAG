The bailee may not entrust the deposit to another unless with the depositor's permission or due to a compelling necessity.  If he delivers it to another without permission, he is liable unless he proves that it would have been lost had it remained in his possession. If he is authorized to secure it with another, he is only liable:

First: If he chooses someone unsuitable to receive the deposit.

Second: Or if he chooses a suitable person but authorizes actions that result in damage.

The depositor may claim directly from that other person in all circumstances that would justify a claim against the original bailee, and his right to proceed against the latter remains.
