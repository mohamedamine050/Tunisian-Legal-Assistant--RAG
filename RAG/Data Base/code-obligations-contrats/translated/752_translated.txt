If proceedings are initiated against the lessee with the intent to compel him to vacate the entire property or a part thereof, or to establish a real right thereon, he must immediately inform the lessor.  He may not relinquish any part of the possession.

Possession in law means the exercise of physical control over property with the intent to possess it.  Litigation is only with the owner, although the lessee may intervene.
