The employee is a worker who works for wages.  The employee, who is a worker who works for wages for service or manufacture, is only obligated to maintain what was entrusted to him to complete the service or manufacture, and he must return it upon completion of his service. If it is damaged or defective due to his fault, then he is liable for compensation.

As for that which was not necessary for the service or manufacture, the rules of deposit apply.
