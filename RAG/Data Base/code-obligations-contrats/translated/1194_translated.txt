If the principal ratifies the act of the unauthorized agent explicitly or implicitly, then the consequences for and against both parties shall be governed by the judgment. A judgment is a written decision of the court that resolves a legal issue or fact.  The agency shall be effective from the commencement of the transaction. As for third parties, their ratification shall only be effective from its date.
