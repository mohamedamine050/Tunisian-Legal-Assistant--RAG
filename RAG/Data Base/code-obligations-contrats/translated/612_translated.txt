The sale of a building includes the land on which it is erected and its appurtenances connected by a decision, such as doors, windows, keys connected to their locks, mills, stairs connected to the building, built-in cabinets, water pipes, and wood and built-in fireplaces within one of its walls.  However, the aforementioned sale does not include non-fixed items whose removal causes no damage, as well as building materials brought for repairs, and items detached from the building to be replaced with others.
