If the term of the lease is not specified by the contracting parties or by the type of service, either the lessee or the lessor may terminate the lease at will, by notifying the other party within the period stipulated in the contract or customary in that place. In such a case, the lessee shall only be entitled to remuneration proportionate to the services rendered, based on the remuneration due for similar services.
