If the sale is rescinded due to a defect, the buyer must return the following to the seller:

Firstly: The defective goods in the condition they were in upon receipt, along with their accessories included in the sale and anything derived from them after the contract.

Secondly: The produce of the goods from the time of agreement on rescission or the court judgment thereof, and also before that, unless the produce was unripe fruit at the time of purchase.  If the buyer found the fruit, even before it ripened, then he retains it; likewise, he retains it if it ripened even if he did not find it.

Furthermore, the seller shall pay the buyer:

Firstly:  What the buyer expended on the produce that he returned.

Secondly: The price agreed upon by the contracting parties, whether it exceeded or fell short of the value of the goods, which he received from the buyer, together with the expenses of concluding the contract.

Thirdly: The losses caused by the seller if he was fraudulent.
