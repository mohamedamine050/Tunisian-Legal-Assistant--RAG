(Completed by Law No. 148 of 1959, dated November 7, 1959).

Loss consists of what has actually been diminished from the creditor's assets and what profit he has missed.

The excess of a company's assets over its liabilities, by including the company's capital among its debts at the end of the financial year, resulting from breach of contract, and consideration of the specific circumstances of each case is entrusted to the judge's wisdom.  He must assess the losses and differentiate them according to the debtor's fault or deceit.

However, in obligations relating to the payment of a specific sum of money, damages shall only be awarded by judgment for the payment of the surplus specified by law.

This award shall be made without requiring the creditor to prove any loss.

The award shall be effective from the date of the notice sent to the debtor by the creditor.

A creditor who has suffered damage exceeding the delay penalty due to the debtor's bad faith may obtain compensation for his damage, irrespective of the specified surplus for the delay penalty.
