Dissolution of Contract

A contract is a legally binding agreement that obligates the contracting parties and defines their obligations and rights with respect to the specific transaction.  Enforcement by court order is not binding on third parties until it is recorded in an official instrument. Similarly, if the parties agree to rescind the contract, the rescission must be recorded in an official instrument and registered.
