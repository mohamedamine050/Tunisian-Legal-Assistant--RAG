If items of varying value are sold for a lump sum without detailing the price of each, and there is an excess or deficiency, the sale is void.

If, however, the price agreed upon by the contracting parties exceeds or falls short of the value of the goods, then if there is an excess, the sale is void.  If there is a deficiency, the buyer has the option to rescind the sale or to accept the goods at their actual value.
