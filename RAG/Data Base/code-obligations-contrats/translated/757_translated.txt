Every claim is a legal procedure initiated by a plaintiff before the court against another party, which may be an individual or a private entity, wherein the plaintiff demands a right or compensation for a loss caused by the other party.  Claims by a lessee against a lessor, pursuant to articles 748, 749, 750, 751, 752, 753, 754, 755, and 756, are extinguished upon the expiration of the lease term.
