If performance of the contract becomes impossible without the fault of either contracting party and without default by the debtor, his liability is discharged, and his right to claim anything due from the other contracting party is extinguished.

If the other contracting party has performed his obligations, he is entitled to recover all or part of what he has paid, as the case may be.
