The lessor may request termination in the following instances:

First: If the lessee does not cultivate the land with the necessary tools and livestock.

Second: If he abandons its service or cultivates it in a manner that a diligent owner would not.

Third: If he uses the land for a purpose other than that for which it was intended, according to its nature or according to the contract.

Generally, if he fails to comply with the terms of the contract and this causes damage to the lessor.

In all the aforementioned instances, the lessor retains his right to claim compensation for losses, if necessary.
