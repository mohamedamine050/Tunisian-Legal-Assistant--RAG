The lessor may retain the tenant's belongings and other movable property found in the leased premises to recover arrears of rent and future rent due during the year, whether the property belongs to the original tenant, a sub-tenant, or another party.

He may also prevent their removal to another location if he requests this from the judge.  If they are removed secretly or against his opposition, he may request their return to the original location or another storage facility. However, he may only retain the amount necessary to secure his debt; if the amount remaining in the leased premises is sufficient to cover his dues against the tenant, he has no right to recover the removed property.

Furthermore, his right to recover the removed property lapses fifteen days after he learns of its removal.

He is not entitled to recover or retain the property in the following circumstances:

Firstly: If it consists of property not subject to distraint.

Secondly: If it is stolen or damaged by its owner.

Thirdly: If it belongs to a third party and the lessor was aware of this at the time it was brought into the premises.
