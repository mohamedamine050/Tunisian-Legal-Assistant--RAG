Settlement

Settlement

[1] A contract concluded to resolve a dispute and terminate litigation, this being done by each of the parties to the settlement relinquishing some of their claims or by handing over money or a right. [2] A contract by which the parties terminate an existing dispute or prevent a potential dispute, this being done by each party reciprocally relinquishing their right.  A settlement between a debtor and one of several joint creditors, if it includes an acknowledgement of the debt or right, benefits the remaining creditors; however, it does not bind them if it provides for discharge of the debt or imposes a burden upon them, unless they consent to it.
