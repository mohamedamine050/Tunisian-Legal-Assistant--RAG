The oath, administered by one party to another in a dispute to resolve the conflict, is permissible if the party lacks legally admissible evidence to prove their claim, relying on the conscience, honor, and religious commitment of the opposing party.  This decisive oath resolves the dispute in every claim, as a legal procedure initiated by a plaintiff against another party, whether an individual or a private entity, wherein the plaintiff claims a right or compensation for a loss caused by the other party.  This is absolute and applicable at every stage of litigation, even if there is initially no evidence to support the claim or defense against which the oath is administered.
