The creditor acting on behalf of his debtor is considered his representative, but only for his own benefit.  Based on this:

Firstly:  It is permissible to object to him in all ways in which it is permissible to object to the debtor, if the reason for the objection predates the creditor's action.

Secondly: It is also permissible to object to the debtor based on the judgment issued in the lawsuit between his creditor acting on his behalf and a third party, even if the debtor was included in that lawsuit from the beginning, or even if he refrained from intervening in it.
