Force majeure, which prevents the fulfillment of contracts, is anything that a person cannot prevent, such as natural disasters like floods, drought, storms, fire, and locusts, or as foreign invasion or an act of the sovereign.  A foreseeable cause is not considered force majeure unless the debtor proves that he exercised all diligence in preventing it. Similarly, a cause resulting from prior negligence of the debtor is not considered force majeure.
