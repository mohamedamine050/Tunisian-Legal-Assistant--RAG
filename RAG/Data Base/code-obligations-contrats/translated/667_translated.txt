There is no recourse against the seller if the defect disappears before the filing of the lawsuit.

[1] A claim is one party requesting their right from another in the presence of a judge; the requestor is called the claimant and the party against whom the claim is made is called the defendant. [2] A claim is the right of anyone entitled to make a request to the court to rule on its subject matter.  For the defendant, it is the right to present grounds for defense or arguments aimed at refuting that request, or during the proceedings if the defect was temporary and not of a nature to recur. This ruling does not apply if the defect is of a nature to reoccur.
