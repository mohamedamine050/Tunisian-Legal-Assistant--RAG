Sale may be made for a single price or for a detailed price based on the unit of weight or measure in what is sold by weight or count, without any perceptible change in the price.

The price is what the contracting parties agree upon, whether it exceeds or falls short of the value of the sale.  If it can be divided without harm, and if the specified quantity is complete upon delivery, the sale is binding in its entirety. If there is a difference in excess or deficiency, whether the sale is for a single price or a detailed price, the rule is that the excess reverts to the seller, and the buyer, in case of deficiency, has the option between rescinding the sale in its entirety or accepting the sale as it is and considering the deficiency in the price, which is what the contracting parties agreed upon, whether it exceeds or falls short of the value of the sale, proportionally.
