Whoever assigns a debt or a mere right for consideration shall guarantee the following:

Firstly:  His status as a creditor or rightholder.

Secondly: The existence of the debt or right at the time of assignment.

Thirdly:  The right to dispose of it.

All of this, even if the assignment occurred without a guarantee. He shall also guarantee the existence of appurtenances, such as mortgages and other rights related to the assigned debt or right at the time of assignment, unless this is explicitly excluded. Whoever assigns any of the aforementioned without consideration shall bear no guarantee, even if the assigned debt or right exists; rather, he shall only guarantee what results from his fraudulent misrepresentation.
