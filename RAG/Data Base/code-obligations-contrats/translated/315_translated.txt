A thing is considered to be in the possession of the creditor if it is in his warehouses or vessels, or in the warehouses or vessels of his commission agent, representative, or person entrusted by him, or in customs warehouses or a public warehouse.  If the creditor is notified of the dispatch of a thing to him by land or sea, then that thing is considered to be in his possession before its arrival and from the time of his receipt of the dispatch note or bill of lading.
