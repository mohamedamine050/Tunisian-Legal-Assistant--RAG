A telegram is considered an unofficial written document.  However, it constitutes an official act, according to established procedures, if its original is signed by the sender, or if it is proven that the aforementioned person submitted the original to the telegraph office, even if not signed by him personally. The date and time indicated on the telegram serve as evidence of the day and hour of its delivery or submission to the telegraph office, until proven otherwise.
