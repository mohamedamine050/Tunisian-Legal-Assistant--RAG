If the obligation is conditional upon the occurrence of an event within a specified time limit, and that event does not occur until the expiry of the time limit, the condition is extinguished.  The court may not, in such a case, extend the aforementioned time limit. If no time limit is specified, the condition is fulfilled upon the occurrence of the event.  A ruling that the condition is extinguished shall only be made if it is definitively established that the event will not occur in the future.
