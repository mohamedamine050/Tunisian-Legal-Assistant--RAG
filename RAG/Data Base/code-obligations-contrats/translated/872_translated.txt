If the lessee provides materials for the work and a defect appears during the service in those materials, or in the land upon which the construction is situated, or elsewhere, and that defect is such as to prevent the completion of the work properly, the contractor must immediately inform his lessee thereof; otherwise, he shall be liable for the resulting damages, unless the defect was of a hidden nature.
