If the sold item has a defect discoverable upon delivery, and a new defect unrelated to the buyer occurs after delivery, the buyer has the option of either keeping the item and claiming compensation for the original defect from the seller, or returning the item with an adjustment to the price agreed upon by the contracting parties, whether that price exceeds or falls short of the value of the item, to account for the defect occurring after the sale. However, the seller may request the return of the item in its current state, provided that the seller waives any claim for compensation for the subsequent defect.  In this instance, the buyer has the option of keeping the item as is, foregoing any claim for the defect, or returning it without paying any compensation.
