The guarantor's obligation requires that he shall not do anything that might disturb the lessee or hinder him from enjoying the benefit he expects from the leased property, as it was prepared for and as its condition was at the time of the lease. This guarantee is not limited to what arises from his actions and the actions of his agents, but extends to what arises from the actions of other lessees or others to whom he has granted a right.
