If the manufactured item has a defect or deficiency, the lessee may refuse to accept it or return it within one week of its receipt for the lessor to repair it within a reasonable time limit set by the lessee. If the time limit expires and the lessor has not fulfilled his obligation, the lessee has the choice between three options:

Firstly: To commission someone to repair the manufactured item, as long as it is repairable, and charge the lessor for it.

Secondly: To claim a reduction in the price.

Thirdly: To claim termination of the agreement and leave the manufactured item with its maker, while also claiming compensation for damages.

In all of the above, as required.

If the lessee provides the materials for the manufactured item, the lessor is liable for their value, and the provisions of Articles 659, 660, and 661 apply to the second and third options above.
