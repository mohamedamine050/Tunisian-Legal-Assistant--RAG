If, as decided in the preceding clause, the thing is lost, the debtor is obligated to pay its value at the time of maturity. If the claimant does not provide evidence of the value, it must be assessed according to the description provided by the defendant, if no other means is available, provided that the description is plausible and supported by oath. If the defendant refuses to take the oath, the claimantâ€™s assertion is deemed true by his oath.
