Whoever acquires the property of another without right shall return it in kind if it exists, or return its value upon its delivery if it is damaged or deteriorated by his act or negligence.  If he intentionally appropriates the property of another, including damage and deterioration, even if by a sudden event from the time that property came into his possession, he shall also return the produce, additions, and profits accruing to him from the day he acquired it, together with what he would have been entitled to had he managed it properly. However, if his acquisition was due to ignorance and lack of intent, he is only obligated to return what he benefited from the day the lawsuit was filed against him.
