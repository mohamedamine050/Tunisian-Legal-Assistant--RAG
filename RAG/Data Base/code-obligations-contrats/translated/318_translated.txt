The right of retention does not apply to things that are owned by the debtor and delivered to the creditor for a specific purpose, or those that the creditor is obligated to use for a particular thing. However, if the creditor subsequently learns of the debtor's default or of a judgment declaring his bankruptcy, he then has the right of retention.
