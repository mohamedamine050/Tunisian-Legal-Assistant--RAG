[1] A claim is one party's request for another party to fulfill their right in the presence of a judge; the requester is called the claimant, and the requested party is called the defendant. [2] A claim is the right of anyone with a claim to bring it before the court for judgment on its subject matter.  For the opposing party, it is the right to present arguments or defenses aimed at refuting that claim.
