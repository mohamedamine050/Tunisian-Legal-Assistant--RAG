If the deposit consists of fungible goods, the depositary may not mix them with other goods except with the express permission of their owners.  In such a case, the deposit does not become the property of the depositary, but he may deliver to each depositor the amount deposited without the permission of the others. However, if it is impossible to distinguish them, such as different types of coinage, or if they are similar, such as coinage of the same type, he may mix them without permission.
