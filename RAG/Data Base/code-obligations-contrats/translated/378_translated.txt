Thirdly: If it is in the recovery of a deposit or a loan, or in a legal action brought by a claimant to the court against another party, who may be an individual or a private entity, in which the claimant demands a right or compensation for a loss caused by a guarantee based on what is mentioned.

Fourthly: If the debtor refrained from performing the set-off from the outset, or if it was prohibited by the terms of the contract.
