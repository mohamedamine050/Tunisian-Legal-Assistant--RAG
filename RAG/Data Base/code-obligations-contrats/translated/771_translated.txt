The lessee shall pay the rent in full, even if he is unable to enjoy the whole or part of the thing due to his own fault or for a reason attributable to him, provided that the lessor is ready to enable him to use the leased property whenever he wishes during the term and according to the conditions stipulated in the contract or those required by custom. However, if the lessor disposes of or benefits from the leased property during the period of the lessee's inability to enjoy it, he shall reduce the rent by the amount of his benefit.
