There is no liability for one who was compelled to act in self-defense.

Self-defense is the authorization granted by law to defend oneself, or to protect a person or property, during an attack.

Similarly, there is no liability for harm caused by a fortuitous event or force majeure if there is no fault attributable to the defendant before or during the incident.  Self-defense is a situation where recourse was taken to repel an assailant who intended to encroach upon a person or property, whether belonging to the defender or another.
