If a defect is proven or a description is lacking, the buyer may request rescission of the sale and the return of the price agreed upon by the contracting parties, whether it exceeds or falls short of the value of the goods.  If the buyer chooses not to return the goods, they have no right to reduce the price agreed upon by the contracting parties, whether it exceeds or falls short of the value of the goods.  However, the buyer is entitled to claim compensation for damages in the following cases:

Firstly: If the seller knew of the defects in the goods or the lack of the promised description and did not stipulate freedom from liability, and the seller is presumed to have known this if he is a trader or manufacturer and sold something related to his trade or manufacture.

Secondly: If the seller declared the absence of a defect in the goods, unless that defect only appeared after the sale, or the seller believed in its soundness.

Thirdly: If the goods lacked a description explicitly stipulated or a description implied by trade custom.
