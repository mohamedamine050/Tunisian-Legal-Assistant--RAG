Contract

A contract is a binding legal agreement that obligates the contracting parties and defines their obligations and rights concerning the specific transaction.

Assignment is complete if accepted by the assignor and the assignee, even without the knowledge of the assignor. However, if there is enmity between the assignee and the debtor (the party whose obligation is assigned), the assignment is only valid with the consent of the debtor; the debtor has the right to refuse it.
