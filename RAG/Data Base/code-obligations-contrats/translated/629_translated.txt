The buyer's right to rescind the sale or to reduce the price agreed upon by the contracting parties, whether it exceeds or falls short of the value of the goods sold, and the seller's right to claim the complement of the price agreed upon by the contracting parties, whether it exceeds or falls short of the value of the goods sold; in the aforementioned circumstances, this must be done within one year from the date specified in the initial contract.  If the buyer disposes of the goods sold, the aforementioned year shall be counted from the date of the contract. Silence regarding this matter during the aforementioned period extinguishes the right.
