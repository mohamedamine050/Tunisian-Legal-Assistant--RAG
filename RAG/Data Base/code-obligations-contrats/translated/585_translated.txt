The purchaser shall bear the state debts and charges levied on the sale from the time of the completion of the sale, unless this contradicts the terms of the contract.  He shall also bear the expenses of preserving the sale and collecting its produce from that time. The sale shall then be at the purchaser's risk, even before its delivery to him, unless this contradicts the contract.
