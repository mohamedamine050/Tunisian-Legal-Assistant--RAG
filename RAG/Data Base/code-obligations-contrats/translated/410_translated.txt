No hearing shall be given to any claim, a legal action brought by a claimant before a court against another party, which may be a person or a private entity, in which the claimant demands a right or compensation for a loss caused thereby, between partners or between them and others if related to obligations arising from a contract.

A contract is a legally binding agreement that obligates the contracting parties and defines their obligations and rights with respect to the specific transaction.

The company, after five years from the date of publication of the contract,  the contract being a legally binding agreement that obligates the contracting parties and defines their obligations and rights with respect to the specific transaction,  is not subject to any form of appeal concerning the dissolution of the company or a partner's withdrawal therefrom. If the creditor's right against the company arises after the publication date, the aforementioned period shall only be considered from the time it arises.

This does not contradict any shorter limitation periods established by law for claims relating to the company.

A claim [1] is a request by one party for their rights from another in the presence of a judge; the requester is called the claimant and the requested party is called the defendant. [2] A claim is the right of anyone with a claim to bring it before the court for a judgment on its subject matter.  It is, for the opponent, the right to present reasons for defense or arguments aimed at refuting that request.
