A confession is valid only from one who possesses legal capacity.  The confession of a parent regarding their minor child, or the confession of a guardian, custodian, or manager, is not binding on those under their authority except for acts personally performed by them within the scope of their management. A minor authorized to engage in commerce may confess only within the limits of their authorization. If the subject matter of his confession is a gratuitous act, it is void.
