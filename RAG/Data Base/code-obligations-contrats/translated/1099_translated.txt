(Amended by Law No. 57 of 2000, dated June 13, 2000)

It is permissible to calculate interest on unpaid interest on the principal, if stipulated in writing.

In civil matters, unpaid interest referred to in the first paragraph cannot be added to the principal unless it is specified for a full year and the debtor's failure to pay is not attributable to the creditor.

In commercial matters, unpaid interest whose due date has passed may be added to the principal, and interest shall be calculated thereon from the due date, according to the formula stipulated in the first paragraph, provided that the delay in payment is not attributable to the creditor.

Contrary to the provisions of the first paragraph, and in the matter of current accounts, unpaid interest shall be added to the principal, and in turn shall accrue further interest, taking into account the customary deadlines, until the account is closed, unless otherwise stipulated.
