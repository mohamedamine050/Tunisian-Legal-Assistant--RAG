If a person undertakes to do something and is liable for damages upon failure to perform, and if the performance of the obligation does not depend on the obligor himself, the obligee may have it performed by another using the debtor's assets, without exceeding the amount necessary for execution.  If the amount exceeds one hundred dinars, the creditor must obtain the authorization of the judge.
