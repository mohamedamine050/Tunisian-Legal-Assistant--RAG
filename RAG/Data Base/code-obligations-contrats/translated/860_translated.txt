The service lease expires upon the termination of its stipulated term between the contracting parties.  If the employee continues in the service of his employer thereafter without objection from the latter, this shall be considered a renewal of the contract between them for the same stipulated term as the first contract, if it was for one year or less. If it was for more than one year, the second lease shall be considered for one year only; and if it was for a month, then for a month.  If the employee continues in the service after being notified by his employer to terminate the service, no renewal of the lease shall result.
