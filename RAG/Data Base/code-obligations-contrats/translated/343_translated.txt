If a debtor has several debts and pays something, and specifies which debt the payment is allocated to at the time of payment, then his right to specify his intention remains.  If doubt arises, the payment shall be allocated to the debt whose settlement is of the greatest interest to him, and which is the most due. If there are several debts, the payment shall be allocated to the debt that is the least documented for the creditor. If the debts are equally documented, the payment shall be allocated to the debt that is the most burdensome to the debtor. If the debts are equal in burden, the payment shall be allocated to the debt that is the oldest in date.
