The owner of the capital may not stipulate interference in the management of the Qardh contract; otherwise, the contract is void.

For the agent is the sole manager of the Qardh capital, and he alone may undertake all actions related to that management, even if exceeding its limits, if his action is pursuant to the conditions stipulated in the contract or pursuant to commercial custom. In such a case, the owner of the capital's objection is disregarded.
