The judgment issued by the Court, a court where litigation takes place between the parties concerned, is a civil court under the judicial authority which must have its independence within the three branches of government.  A criminal court's decision to release an accused person, an individual accused of committing a criminal offense, does not affect the issue of compensation for the loss arising from the act constituting the charge. This judgment takes the form of the dismissal of the claim [1] A request by one party for their right from another in the presence of a judge; the requester is called the plaintiff and the party from whom the right is requested is the defendant. [2] A claim is the right of anyone who has a claim to bring it before the court for a judgment on its subject matter.  It is for the defendant the right to present grounds for defense or arguments aimed at refuting that claim, due to the death of the accused or the issuance of a general pardon, a decision that exempts the convicted person from criminal conviction.
