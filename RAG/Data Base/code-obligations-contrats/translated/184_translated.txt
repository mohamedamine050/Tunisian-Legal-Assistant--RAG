Settlement

Settlement

[1] A contract established to resolve a dispute and terminate litigation. This is achieved through mutual concessions by the parties involved, either by each party relinquishing some of their claims or by the delivery of money or a right. [2] A contract by which the parties terminate an existing dispute or prevent a potential one, each mutually relinquishing their right.  A settlement between a creditor and one of several jointly and severally liable debtors applies to all of them if it involves the discharge of the debt or other forms of release. However, it only binds them if they consent, should it impose obligations or burdensome conditions upon them.
