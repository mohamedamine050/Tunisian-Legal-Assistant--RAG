There is no guarantee for the depositary in two instances:

Firstly: If the deposit perishes or is damaged due to its own inherent defect, a defect therein, or negligence on the part of the depositor.

Secondly: If its perishing or damage results from a fortuitous event or force majeure, unless this occurred after the depositaryâ€™s delay in returning it or resulted from an act of the depositary, or someone whose act is attributable to him.  He must prove his claim of the fortuitous event or aforementioned defect if he is compensated for the deposit or if accepting deposits is his profession or occupation.
