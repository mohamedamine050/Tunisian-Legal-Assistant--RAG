The lessor shall pay the lessee any expenses exceeding those necessary for the preservation of the leased property.  The lessor shall also pay for beneficial expenses incurred by the lessee without authorization, including the value of materials and plantings and the cost of their maintenance, without regard to any increase in the value of the leased property due to such improvements.  However, the lessor is not obligated to pay for improvement expenses; rather, the lessee shall remove any improvements made, provided that this removal does not cause damage.
