If the sale is made in bulk, the contract is concluded by the mutual agreement of the contracting parties on the price and the subject matter, and the remaining conditions they agreed upon, even if no counting, weighing, or measurement has taken place.  A sale in bulk is the sale of a quantity of things for a single price. In this case, counting, measuring, or weighing them is considered only for the purpose of determining the price of the whole.
