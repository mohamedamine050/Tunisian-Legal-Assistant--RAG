The debtors' liability to the creditor is divided amongst them.  If one of them pays the entire debt or the creditor accepts payment from him, he cannot recover from the others except to the extent of each one's share in the debt. If one of them is unable to pay or absconds from the territory of the Republic, his share shall be distributed among the able and present debtors.  They may recover what they paid from the one who failed to perform his obligation. All of this applies unless the contract contains a stipulation to the contrary.
