If the failure to perform is attributable to the creditor or to another cause attributable to him, the debtor has the right to claim performance of what is due to him under his contract; however, he is obliged to compensate the creditor for any benefit received due to the non-performance of his obligation, or for any benefit derived from the subject matter of the contract.
