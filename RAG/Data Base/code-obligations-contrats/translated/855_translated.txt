The obligation imposed on the lessee as stipulated in the above clause is extinguished if the lessee is entitled to receive the necessary medical treatment and maintenance from a cooperative or insurance company.

An insurance contract is one in which the insurer undertakes to pay the insured or the beneficiary a sum of money, a regular income, or any other financial compensation in the event of the occurrence of the insured event, in exchange for premiums or any other financial payment made by the insured to the insurer.  The obligation is also extinguished if the risk is covered by a solidarity fund.
