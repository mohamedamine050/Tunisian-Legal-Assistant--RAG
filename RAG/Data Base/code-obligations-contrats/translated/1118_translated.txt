The power of attorney for litigation is considered a special power of attorney, and the provisions of this law apply to it.  The attorney for litigation is only empowered to do what has been specifically assigned to him; he is not authorized to collect money, to acknowledge or admit a debt, or to settle.

Settlement [1] is a contract concluded to resolve a dispute and terminate litigation. This is done by each of the parties to the settlement relinquishing part of their claims or by handing over money or a right. [2] It is a contract by which the parties terminate an existing dispute or prevent a potential dispute, each reciprocally relinquishing their right.

Unless otherwise stipulated, the power of attorney for litigation must be witnessed. However, if the attorney is authorized by law, he is considered an attorney.

An attorney is a person acting on behalf of another person in the case whose arguments he presents, even if he does not possess a written power of attorney.
