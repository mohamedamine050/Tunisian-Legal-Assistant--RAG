The purpose of the lessor's guarantee to the lessee is twofold:

Firstly:  Uncontested possession and enjoyment;  there being no dispute or legal conflict between the parties.

Secondly: The lessee's entitlement to the leased thing and its freedom from defects.

This guarantee is legally obligatory even if not stipulated, and the lessor's good faith does not exempt him from liability.
