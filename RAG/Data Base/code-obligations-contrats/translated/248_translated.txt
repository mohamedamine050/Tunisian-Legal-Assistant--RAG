The debtor may perform his obligation either personally or through another.  He must perform personally in the following two instances:

Firstly: If the text explicitly requires the debtor to perform the obligation personally; in this case, representation is not valid, even if the representative is more suitable than the principal.

Secondly: If this condition is implied by the nature of the contract or by the circumstances surrounding it, such as when the obligee's personal skill was one of the reasons for the contract.
