The oath, which one party or litigant directs to another party to resolve the dispute between them, may not be administered if the party lacks the evidence permitted by law to prove their claim, resorting to the conscience, honor, and honesty of that other party, in the following instances:

Firstly: If it is an oath of accusation and the accused wishes to direct it to the claimant.

Secondly: To prove a transaction that the law requires to be proven by an official document or registration.

Thirdly: To deny a matter attested to by an official document if the official who issued it declares that it occurred in their presence.

Fourthly: To prove a legal action brought by the plaintiff before the court against another party, which may be an individual or a private entity, wherein the plaintiff claims a right or compensation for a loss caused by the other party, which the law prohibits due to public order or good morals.

Fifthly: To prove a matter that has been annulled by a final and binding judgment.

Sixthly: If it is clear that the oath is useless or intended to cause harassment.
