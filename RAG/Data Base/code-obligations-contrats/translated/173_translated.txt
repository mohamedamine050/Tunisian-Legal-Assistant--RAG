If one of several joint creditors, having the right of choice, collects his share of the debt and it is lost in his possession due to his negligence, then he is liable to compensate the remaining creditors for the share he collected. However, if it is lost due to an unforeseen event or force majeure without any fault on his part, then he is not liable.
