Official documents are considered valid, even against non-contracting parties, until a claim of forgery is filed. This applies to agreements and matters witnessed by the official who drafted them as having occurred in his presence.

However, if the document is challenged due to coercion, fraud, undue influence, or material error, evidence may be admitted through witness testimony. Proof may also be obtained through strong, consistent, and relevant circumstantial evidence, without the need to file a claim of forgery.

This evidence may be presented by either party or by any third party with a legally acceptable interest.
