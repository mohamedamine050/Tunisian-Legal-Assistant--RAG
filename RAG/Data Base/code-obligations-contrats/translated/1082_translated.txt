A loan contract is formed if the object, whether cash or other fungible goods, is in the debtor's possession as a deposit or otherwise, provided the creditor authorizes the debtor to dispose of it as a loan.  The contract becomes complete upon the agreement of the contracting parties on the terms of the contract.
