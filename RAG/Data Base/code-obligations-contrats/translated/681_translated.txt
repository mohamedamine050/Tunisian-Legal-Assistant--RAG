If a person sells movable property for cash and the buyer delays payment of the price agreed upon by the contracting parties, whether it exceeds or falls short of the value of the sale, the seller may recover it from the buyer as long as it remains in the buyer's possession.  The seller also has the right to prevent the buyer from selling it to another person, provided that the seller's request is made within fifteen days of the delivery of the property.  Recovery is permissible even if the property is incorporated into real estate, and even if third parties have rights over the real estate in which the property is incorporated.

The recovery of the sold goods in the event of the buyer's bankruptcy shall be governed by the provisions of bankruptcy law.
