If the sale concerns movable property, and some of it is lost, the buyer has the option to either request the rescission of the sale and recover the entire price agreed upon by the contracting parties, whether it exceeds or falls short of the value of the goods, or to adhere to the remaining goods and claim a reduction in the price agreed upon by the contracting parties, whether it exceeds or falls short of the value of the goods.  He does not have the right to rescind the sale unless it concerns the entirety of the goods, if there is damage in partitioning them.
