Whoever takes advantage of another's distress, weak understanding, or lack of knowledge of circumstances, and lends him money or extends a term for him with excessive interest or other benefits exceeding the usual amount and the value of the service rendered according to the place and circumstances by a considerable amount, shall be punished by the criminal courts.  It is permissible to invalidate agreements and clauses drawn up contrary to the provisions of this section, even without a request from the debtor; the stipulated excess shall be cancelled, and the debtor shall be reimbursed for what he paid in excess of the amount determined by the court for the permissible interest. If there are multiple creditors, their claims shall be subject to their choice.
