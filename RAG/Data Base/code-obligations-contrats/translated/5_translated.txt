Every individual holding the status of head of household is subject to income tax based on their own income and the income of their children considered under their guardianship for tax calculation. 

A head of household is considered to be:

- The husband, 
- The divorced individual who has children under their guardianship,
- The widower,
- The adoptive parent. 

However, the wife is considered the head of household:

1. When she proves that the husband has no source of income during the year preceding the tax assessment year.
2. When she remarries and retains guardianship of her children from a previous marriage.

Contrary to the provisions of the aforementioned provisions, the head of household may request tax assessment on their minor children who generate income, regardless of its nature.
