(Paragraph one amended by Law No. 14 of 1983, dated February 15, 1983).

If the stipulated surplus exceeds the percentages stipulated in Article 1100 above, the debtor has the right to repay the principal after one year from the date of the contract, and any condition contrary to this is null and void. However, the debtor must notify the creditor in writing two months prior to repayment of his readiness to repay the debt.  Such notification shall be considered as a waiver by the borrower of his right to the longer agreed term.

This Article shall not apply to debts incurred by the State, municipalities, and other legal entities by virtue of law.
