If the claim concerns [1] one party's request for their right from another in the presence of a judge; the requester is called the plaintiff and the one requested from is called the defendant. [2] The claim is the right that belongs to every claimant to bring before the court to rule on its subject matter.  And with respect to the opponent, it is the right to present reasons for defense or arguments aimed at refuting that request.  If the claim is related to an absentee, or the estate of the debtor, or a minor, or others who are not capable of acting, the judge must administer an oath of affirmation to the plaintiff,  who is the person who took the initiative to begin legal proceedings. Otherwise, the judgment is void, but reconciliation is permissible. [1] Reconciliation is a contract concluded to resolve the dispute and end the litigation. This is done by each of the reconciling parties relinquishing some of their claims or by handing over some money or right. [2] A contract by which the parties terminate an existing dispute or prevent a potential dispute, by each reciprocally relinquishing their right in this oath.
