## English Translation of the Arabic Legal Text:

**I.** In the event of a complete transfer or cessation of business in an industrial, commercial, traditional craft, or non-commercial establishment, the taxes levied on profits earned by the establishment subject to the transfer or cessation of business, and which have not been subject to tax, as well as unused savings, are to be paid by means of a notification deposited within fifteen days from the date of the transfer or final closure of the establishment in the case of cessation of business.

The tax identification card is to be returned within the same timeframes to the competent tax authorities, in exchange for a receipt of delivery, for the institution in question. (Added by Article 66 of Law No. 90 of 2004, dated December 31, 2004 and amended by Article 88-1 of Law No. 54 of 2013, dated December 30, 2013).

The same timeframe applies to unpaid tax liabilities.

**II.** The purchaser bears the responsibility for paying the taxes due in the name of the transferred establishment, up to the amount of the transfer price, jointly and severally with the transferor, within twenty days from the date of filing the declaration referred to in the first paragraph of this article by the transferor, in the event of a transfer with or without consideration, unless the purchaser notifies the tax administration in writing of the transaction within the same timeframes granted to the transferor.

**III.** If the matter concerns natural persons, the taxes levied in the event of a transfer or cessation of business, in accordance with the legislation in force at the date of the transfer, shall, if necessary, be deducted from the amount of the personal income tax calculated in the future based on their total income.
