It is permissible to pursue damages with a claim before the criminal courts if there is encroachment based on deceit and fraud, as in the following instances:

Firstly: If a person uses a name or mark similar to another, which is indicative of another known establishment or entity that has gained a reputation, in order to mislead the public and create a deception regarding the manufacturer's name and place of manufacture.

Secondly: If a person uses a mark, image, writing, signboard, or other similar symbols identical in nature and appearance to those legally used by another trader or manufacturer, or in another manufacturing establishment, and their trade involves similar goods in the same location, to attract customers to himself and turn them away from the other.

Thirdly: If someone adds to the name of goods certain words such as "manufactured by so-and-so" or "manufactured according to the design of so-and-so," or similar expressions, to deceive people about the true origin or type of the goods.

Fourthly: If a person spreads through advertisements or other methods of publicity to lead people to believe that he has assumed the rights of a known trading or manufacturing establishment, or has become its representative.
