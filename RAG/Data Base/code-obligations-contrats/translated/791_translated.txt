The lease terminates upon the expiry of its stipulated term between the contracting parties, without the need for any notice.

Notice is a unilateral legal act; it is a verbal or written reminder addressed to an employee by their direct supervisor, indicating the infringement committed and requesting adherence to regulations and rules.  Neither party is required to notify the other, unless a clause stipulating notice exists between them; this is subject to the specific provisions concerning the lease of land.
