If the assignor guaranteed the debtor's ability to perform, his guarantee shall lapse in the following two instances:

Firstly: If the failure to perform is due to the assignee's act or his negligence or oversight in failing to take the necessary measures to recover the debt.

Secondly: If the assignee granted the debtor an extension of time after its maturity.  This guarantee shall be governed by the specific provisions stipulated in the chapter on sale.
