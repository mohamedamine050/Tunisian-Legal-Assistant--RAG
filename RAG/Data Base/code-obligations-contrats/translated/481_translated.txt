The authority conferred by law upon the judgments of courts that are not subject to any form of appeal relates only to what the court has decided and is only invoked with regard to its subject matter or what is a necessary consequence thereof. This is only the case under the following conditions:

Firstly: That the subject matter of the claim be one.

Secondly: That the cause of action be one.

Thirdly: That the claim be between the same parties,  in the same capacity, between whom the judgment was rendered.

Heirs and those who have succeeded to the rights of the parties are considered as the parties themselves, unless there is fraud or collusion.
