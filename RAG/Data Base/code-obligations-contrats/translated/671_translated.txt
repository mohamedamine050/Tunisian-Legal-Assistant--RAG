The Buyer Shall Not Be Entitled to Claim a Defect:

Firstly: If he was aware of it and accepted it.

Secondly: If he was aware of it and subsequently sold the object or disposed of it as an owner.

Thirdly: If he used the object for himself and benefited from it after becoming aware of the defect. However, this ruling does not apply to buildings and similar immovable property, as it is permissible to use them for habitation during the period for requesting rescission.
