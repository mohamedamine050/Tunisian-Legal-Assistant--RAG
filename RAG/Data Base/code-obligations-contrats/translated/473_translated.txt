A person's sworn testimony is often used as evidence in court.  Witnesses do not constitute evidence in agreements and other legal grounds that may create, transfer, modify, or extinguish an obligation or right. If the sum of money involved exceeds one thousand dinars, then a formal or informal instrument of evidence must be drawn up.
