The oath administered to one party by another party in a dispute, when evidence permitted by law to prove his claim is lacking, appealing to the conscience, honor, and religion of that party, shall be performed at the mosque or other place of worship designated by the party who administered the oath, and according to the religion of the party taking the oath.

If the place designated for the administration of the oath administered by one party to another in a dispute, when evidence permitted by law to prove his claim is lacking, appealing to the conscience, honor, and religion of that party, is more than three miles from the court that ruled on it, the party may refuse to go there.
