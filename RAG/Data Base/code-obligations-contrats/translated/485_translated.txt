If a legal presumption establishes the validity of a claim – a legal procedure initiated by a claimant before a court against another party, which may be an individual or a private entity, wherein the claimant demands a right or compensation for a loss caused by the other party – then it dispenses the claimant from any other evidence, and no evidence is admissible to contradict the legal presumption.
