If the obligation is for specific things, the debtor is only obligated to that which is specified in the obligation in terms of quantity, type, and description, regardless of any increase or decrease in its value.  If the agreed-upon things become lost, the creditor has the option of either awaiting their existence or rescinding the contract with reimbursement for expenses incurred.
