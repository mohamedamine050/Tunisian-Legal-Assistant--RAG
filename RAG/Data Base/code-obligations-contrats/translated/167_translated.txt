The remaining joint creditors shall have no recourse against, nor shall they be affected by, any of the following occurrences with one of them:

Firstly: If one of them directs an oath to the debtor, an oath administered by one party to another in order to resolve a dispute between them where legal proof is lacking to substantiate a claim, relying on the conscience and integrity of the debtor.

Secondly: If a final and unappealable judgment is issued by the court resolving a legal or factual matter between one of them and the debtor.


All of the foregoing shall not apply if the contract or the nature of the matter dictates otherwise.
