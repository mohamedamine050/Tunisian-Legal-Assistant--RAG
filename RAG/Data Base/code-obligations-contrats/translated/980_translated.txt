(Amended by Law No. 23 of 1957, dated September 25, 1957)

A usufruct or perpetual emphyteusis with a variable payment is a contract.  A contract is a legally binding agreement that obligates the contracting parties and defines their obligations and rights concerning the specific transaction.  By virtue thereof, the owner of a ruined property irrevocably assigns the property to another and their heirs, retaining only bare ownership, while the assignee is obligated to pay a perpetual annuity.

The holder of the usufruct may dispose of the assigned property as an owner would, subject to the condition of paying the annuity.
