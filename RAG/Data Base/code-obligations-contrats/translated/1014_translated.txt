The deposit shall not be delivered upon the depositor's death except to his heir or to someone legally representing him.  If there are multiple heirs, the depositary has the choice between referring the matter to the court to act according to its order and be released from the obligation, or delivering the deposit to the heirs, each according to their share in the inheritance and the obligation upon them. If the deposit is indivisible, the heirs must agree on how it is to be delivered. If among them there is a minor or an absentee, they cannot refuse delivery except with the court's permission. If no agreement is reached among them, the depositary's liability is discharged by securing the deposit in a safe place in the manner prescribed by law. Each of the beneficiaries may request the court to compel him to do so. If the debt encompasses the estate or if there is a testamentary disposition, the matter shall also be referred to the court.

An agreement between two or more persons to commit a felony or a misdemeanor such as theft, fraud, or forgery, whether specified or unspecified, or to perform preparatory or facilitating acts for their commission, whenever the agreement is organized, even in its initial formation, and ongoing, even for a short period, is punishable. If the court does not authorize them, the depositaryâ€™s liability is discharged by securing the deposit in a safe place, in the manner prescribed by law.  Each of the beneficiaries may request the court to compel him to do so.
