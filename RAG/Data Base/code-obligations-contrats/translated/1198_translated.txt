The contract is concluded.  The contract is a binding legal agreement that obligates the contracting parties and defines their obligations and rights concerning the specific transaction.  The Qard contract is concluded by the mutual agreement of the contracting parties on its essential terms and by the delivery of the money to the worker.  If either party wishes to terminate the contract before the delivery of the money, he may do so. This delivery is effected merely by consent if the money is in the possession of the worker; otherwise, it is not a debt owed by him.
