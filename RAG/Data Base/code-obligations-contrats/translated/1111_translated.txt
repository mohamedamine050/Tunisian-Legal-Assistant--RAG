If the power of attorney is presented to the person for whom it is constituted, he is obliged to accept it unless he is unaware of his refusal upon receipt of the power of attorney.  If he refuses, he must take all necessary measures to safeguard the interests of the person who appointed him. If goods are sent to him, he must place them in a safe place and take the necessary measures to preserve them at the expense of the principal until their owner is able to dispose of them as he sees fit. If the goods are perishable, he must sell them through the court after establishing their condition.
