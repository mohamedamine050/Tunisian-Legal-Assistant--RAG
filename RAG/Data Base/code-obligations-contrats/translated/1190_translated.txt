The rightful owner is not obligated to return what a meddler has disbursed from his property without the intention of reimbursement. This is applicable in two instances:

Firstly: If the disposition was undertaken despite the rightful owner's prohibition, except in the situations outlined in Article 1184 above.

Secondly: If it clearly appears that the disposer did not intend to effect the disbursement.
