If a judicial officer fails in his duties, he is liable for damages to the person who suffered the harm.

Harm [1] is injury inflicted in violation of the law, affecting a person's body, mental or psychological health, reputation, property, or honor. [2]  Loss or damage inflicted on property, deprivation of comfort, or harm to physical well-being, reputation, or the like.  In crimes and quasi-crimes, harm is the loss actually suffered by the claimant, and the necessary expenses that he was or will be compelled to incur to repair the consequences of the act committed to his detriment, as well as what he was deprived of within the normal limits of the consequences of that act;  this includes whenever criminal judgments require his prosecution.
