Whoever causes harm to another through fault, whether the harm is physical or moral, is liable for their fault if it is proven that they are the direct cause of the harm. Any condition contradicting this is void.  Fault is the omission of what should have been done or the doing of what should have been omitted, without intent to cause harm.
