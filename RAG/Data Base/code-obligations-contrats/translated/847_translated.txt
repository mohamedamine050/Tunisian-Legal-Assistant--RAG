There is no guarantee for the employee if what is in his custody is defective or destroyed by a fortuitous event or force majeure, and the cause was not his act or negligence, unless he is required to return those things and delays in returning them.

As for the damage to the thing due to a defect in it or its rapid deterioration, it is considered as a fortuitous event if there was no negligence on the part of the employee.

If the employee claims a fortuitous event, it is incumbent upon him to prove it.
