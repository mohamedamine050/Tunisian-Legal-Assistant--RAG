Dismissal of the Claim

The Claim
[1] A claim is a request by one party to another for the enforcement of a right in the presence of a judge; the requester is called the claimant and the party requested is called the defendant. [2] A claim is the right of every claimant to bring their claim before the court for judgment on its merits. It is also the right of the opposing party to present reasons for defense or objections aiming to refute the claim.

The lapse of the aforementioned five years applies to payments by the State and to payments by municipal administrations.
