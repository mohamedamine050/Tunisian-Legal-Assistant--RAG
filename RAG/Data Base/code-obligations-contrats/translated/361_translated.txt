Renewal of the contract occurs in three ways.

Firstly: That the creditor and debtor agree to replace the old contract with a new contract, either upon the expiration of the former or upon a change of its cause.

Secondly: That a new debtor replaces the old debtor, whom the creditor has discharged; the consent of the first debtor is not required in this substitution.

Thirdly: If a new obligation arises and a new creditor replaces the old creditor, and the debtor's liability is extinguished with respect to the latter.  The mere designation of a person to perform a debtor's obligation on his behalf, or the mere designation of a person to receive payment on behalf of a creditor, does not constitute a renewal of the contract.
