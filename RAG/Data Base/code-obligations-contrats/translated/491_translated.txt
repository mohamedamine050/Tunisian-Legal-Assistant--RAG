If, regarding the disputed movables, warehouse receipts issued by the designated warehouse keeper, transport documents, or similar instruments are produced, the possessor of the thing itself takes precedence over the possessor of the evidence, if both parties are equally suspect.  Suspicion, in this context, refers to the presumption of having committed a crime before the charges are filed.  This applies when both possess the aforementioned documents.
