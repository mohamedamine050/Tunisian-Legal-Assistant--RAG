(Amended by the order dated September 15, 1923).

Creditors may challenge contracts concluded by their debtor on the grounds that they were concluded to their detriment through fraud and deceit, but without constituting an offense described as a felony under this law—crimes punishable by death or imprisonment exceeding five years.  Offenses are described as misdemeanors if punishable by imprisonment exceeding fifteen days but not exceeding five years, or by a fine exceeding sixty dinars.  Offenses are described as infractions if punishable by imprisonment not exceeding fifteen days or a fine not exceeding sixty dinars. (Article 122 of the Code of Criminal Procedure). This does not apply to judgments related to personal status or inheritance.

If creditors cannot recover their claims against the debtor, and the debtor has rights against third parties, the creditors may bring their case before the court. After establishing their rights, they may obtain a seizure. The seizure allows a creditor holding an enforceable instrument to place the debtor's movable property under the authority of the court, including the debtor's rights and debts against third parties, and to pursue the related rights and claims, except for rights specific to the debtor's person, such as parental rights over a child, rights of usufruct, habitation, maintenance, and rights arising from a misdemeanor—crimes punishable by imprisonment exceeding fifteen days but not exceeding five years, or by a fine exceeding sixty dinars—or similar offenses committed against the person. In general, anything that cannot be validly seized or assigned is excluded. However, the rescission based on the debtor's incapacity or minority is not considered a personal claim within the meaning of this article and may be undertaken by the creditors.
