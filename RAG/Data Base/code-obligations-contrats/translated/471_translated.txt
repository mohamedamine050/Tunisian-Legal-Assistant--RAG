(Amended by Law No. 57 of the year 2000, dated June 13, 2000).

Copies, whether private or public, found in public archives, if taken in accordance with the law, are considered as originals. This rule applies to copies taken from court registers containing evidence, if their conformity to the original is attested, or if such copies are made using the methods referred to in the preceding article.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph shall apply if a party or a custodian of documents does not retain the original document and submits a fixed and permanent copy thereof.

A fixed and permanent copy shall be considered as any copy resulting in an irreversible change in the physical form of the document, such as microfilm, microfiche, and any other electronic or optical storage method.
