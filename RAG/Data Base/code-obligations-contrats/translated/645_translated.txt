If the sale is reclaimed from the buyer due to his fraud or negligence, and this was the reason for the judgment issued in the case, then the seller does not provide a guarantee, even if the buyer informed him of the aforementioned case in a timely manner.  Among these circumstances are the following:

Firstly: If the period of possession began before the sale and the buyer delayed until it was completed against him, or if the seller began a period of possession and the buyer failed to complete it.

Secondly: If a land registry entry detrimental to the buyer's rights occurred, and he had the right to oppose it but did not do so in the necessary time.

Thirdly: If the reason for the reclamation is based on an act of the buyer or on a reason inherent to him.
