The oath administered by one party to another in a dispute to resolve the existing conflict, if the party lacks evidence permitted by law to prove their claim, relying on the conscience, integrity, and religious duty of the other party.  Failure to take the oath is only binding on the party who administered it, or their successors by inheritance or otherwise. However, failure of one heir to take the oath is not binding on the other heirs.
