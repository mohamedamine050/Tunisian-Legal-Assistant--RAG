If the right attached to another's property is necessary and appurtenant to the property's nature, such as a right of way over land if it is surrounded by another's property on all sides, then in this case, the buyer shall not have recourse against the seller unless the seller guaranteed to the buyer that no third party has a right over the property sold.
