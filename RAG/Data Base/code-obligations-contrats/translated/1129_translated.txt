The agent is responsible for those whom he has been appointed as agent for, unless he has been authorized to appoint a sub-agent without specifying a person. In this case, he is only liable if he chooses someone unsuitable to be an agent, or if he chooses a suitable person and authorizes him to do something that causes harm, or fails to supervise him when it was his duty to do so according to the circumstances.
