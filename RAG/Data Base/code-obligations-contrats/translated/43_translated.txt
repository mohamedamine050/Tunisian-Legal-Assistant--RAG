The estimated assessment, based on the evident and manifest personal expenses or the increase in wealth, shall apply to all tax claims unless the taxpayer proves the sources of financing their expenses or the increase in their wealth.

To justify these expenses and the growth of wealth, income subject to tax realized during the period covered by the statute of limitations and declared and on which the required tax was paid before January 1st of the year for which the estimated assessment is applied shall be accepted, unless it is proven that these incomes were used in other acquisitions.

(Amended by Article 59 of Law No. 85 of 2006 dated December 25, 2006)

This method shall be used when the amount of this assessment, with the addition of living expenses and considering the standard of living of the person concerned, exceeds their declared income, which is determined following the same procedure as that followed for the estimated assessment based on the elements of the standard of living.
