If the defective part is of such significance that the buyer, had he known of it, would not have purchased, he has the option of recovering the value of the defective part while maintaining the sale of the remainder, or of demanding rescission of the entire sale and recovering the full price.  The price agreed upon by the contracting parties, whether it exceeds or falls short of the value of the goods, is irrelevant. However, if the defective part is not of sufficient importance to constitute a defect, the buyer does not have the right to rescind the sale; rather, he is entitled to claim a reduction in the price corresponding to the value of the defective part.
