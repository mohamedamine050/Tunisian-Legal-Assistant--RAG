Every claim is a legal action brought by a claimant before a court against another party, which may be a person or a private entity, wherein the claimant demands a right or compensation for a loss caused by that party.  Claims by a lessor against a lessee, pursuant to Articles 774, 776, 778, 779, 780, and 782 above, are extinguished after six months from the lessor's receipt of the rent from his lessee.
