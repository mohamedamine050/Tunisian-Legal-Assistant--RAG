Statute of Limitations for Claims

A claim [1] is a request by one party (the claimant) from another (the defendant) in the presence of a judge;  [2] a claim is the right of every claimant to bring their case before the court to obtain a judgment on the subject matter.  For the defendant, it is the right to present reasons for defense or objections aimed at refuting that request.

The statute of limitations is interrupted in the following ways:

Firstly: If the creditor approaches the debtor and demands payment of what is due, judicially or otherwise, with a verifiable date, even if the demand is made before an incompetent court or is void due to a procedural defect.


Secondly: If the creditor requests the registration of their debt with the other debts of the bankrupt.

Thirdly: If the creditor takes any legal action regarding the *`aqla`*—the legal seizure that allows a creditor holding an enforceable instrument to place the debtor's movable property under the authority of the court—on the debtor's assets to recover their right or obtains permission from the competent authority to take such measures.
