Abstract rights may be sold, such as the right to hunt on land or in water in a specific location, or the right to use a specific quantity of water, its location and average amount, even if it varies according to the abundance or scarcity of rainfall; or like planting a stake in a neighbor's wall; or like a right of way.

Similarly, property owned by its owner but not currently in his possession may be sold, such as domestic animals that habitually return to their owners.
