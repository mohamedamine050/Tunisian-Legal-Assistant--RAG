Copies of official and unofficial documents taken from the original are considered as originals if their authenticity is attested to by authorized public officials in the countries where the copies were taken, or if their authenticity is acknowledged by the party against whom they are produced, or if they are signed by that party, or if they are produced using technical means that provide all guarantees of their conformity with the originals.

In the event that these conditions are not met, they shall be submitted for examination to determine their authenticity.
