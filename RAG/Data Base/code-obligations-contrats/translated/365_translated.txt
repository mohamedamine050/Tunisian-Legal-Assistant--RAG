If the debtor accepts the assignment, he is not permitted to oppose the new creditor who accepted the debt in good faith and hold him liable for what he could have held the original creditor liable for.  His recourse is only against the original creditor. However, the assignor may oppose the new creditor with regard to the capacity of the person, if such opposition is based on a fact existing at the time of acceptance of the assignment and which was unknown to him at that time.
