The referral concerning the house is not considered valid unless he has been informed thereof. The transferor himself remains liable to him for the performance of the assignment and all the terms of the contract until he informs him of the referral as per the law.  At that point, the transferee has the right to object. However, prior to notification, he may claim from both the transferor and the transferee the performance of the assignment and the remaining rights arising from the contract.  The transferor and transferee are jointly and severally liable.

The contract is a legally binding agreement that obligates the contracting parties and defines their obligations and rights with respect to the specific transaction.
