Legal presumptions are those judgments regarding specific actions or facts that the law assigns:

Firstly:  What the law invalidates as being based on a characteristic intended to circumvent its provisions.

Secondly: In instances where the law stipulates that the enrichment or exoneration of an estate occurs upon the fulfillment of specific conditions, such as exoneration by the passage of time.

Thirdly:  What the law assigns as the effect of a final and unappealable judgment.
