The worker may retain the manufactured item and other property of the employer in his possession to recover his wages and expenses, unless the contract stipulates payment of wages at a specific time. In such a case, the worker becomes a guarantor for what he has retained, in accordance with the provisions for a mortgagee in Article 602. However, if the manufactured item is damaged without fault on the part of the worker, his right to wages is extinguished, as he is only entitled to them upon delivery of the manufactured item.
