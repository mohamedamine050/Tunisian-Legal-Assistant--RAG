If an interruption occurs in the period of the statute of limitations for the claim, the claim [1] is a request by one party for their right from another in the presence of a judge; the requester is called the plaintiff and the requested party is called the defendant. [2] The claim is the right that belongs to every claimant to present to the court to obtain a judgment in their favor regarding its subject matter.  It is, with respect to the opponent, the right to present reasons for defense or arguments aimed at refuting that request.  If the debtor who is legitimately liable for the entire debt, as mentioned in the preceding section, withdraws, the effect of that withdrawal extends to the remaining joint debtors.
