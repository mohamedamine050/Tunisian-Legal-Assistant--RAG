The deferred debt becomes due if the debtor is declared bankrupt or if, through his actions, any of the specific guarantees he provided in the contract are diminished, or if he fails to provide what he promised. This ruling also applies if fraud was intended and a right or privilege was concealed, previously placed on the provided guarantees.  If the aforementioned guarantees are diminished without his will, it does not cause the forfeiture of his right to the term; however, the creditor may then either request additional guarantees or immediate performance of the contract if that is not feasible.
