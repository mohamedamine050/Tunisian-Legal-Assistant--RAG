The legally admissible evidence consists of five types:

Firstly: Confession.

Secondly: Written evidence.

Thirdly: Witness testimony.

Fourthly: Presumption.

Fifthly: Oath;  the oath administered by one party to another to resolve the dispute between them, if the party lacks the evidence permitted by law to prove their claim, relying on the conscience, integrity, and religious commitment of the other party; and the refusal to take the oath.
