The issuance of an exploitation visa, as required by Chapter Five, is contingent upon the payment of a fee to the Cinematographic Production Development Fund.

The amount of this fee and the procedures for its payment are determined by a decree issued upon the proposal of the Secretary of State for Information and Guidance and the Secretary of State for Finance and Trade.
