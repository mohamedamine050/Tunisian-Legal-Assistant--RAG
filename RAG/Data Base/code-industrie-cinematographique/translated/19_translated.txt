A special fee, designated as the "Contribution Fee for the Development of Film Production in Tunisia," is established for the benefit of the Film Production Development Fund, to be collected from spectators in cinema halls.

This fee is levied in the same manner as the subscription fee established by Article 81 of Order 9 Jumada al-Ula 1366 (31 March 1956) as amended by Order 21 Dhu al-Qa'dah 1375 (30 June 1956). The amount of this fee shall be determined by an order issued upon the proposal of the Secretary of State for Information and Guidance and the Secretary of State for Finance and Trade.
