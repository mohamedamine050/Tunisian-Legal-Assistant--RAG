Any person who violates the measures stipulated in this law and the legal texts adopted for its implementation, particularly those who broadcast or present to the public cinematic films without a license or in violation of the conditions upon which the license is granted, shall be punished with a fine ranging from one hundred dinars to two thousand dinars, in addition to the administrative seizure of the film.

The judgment issued by the court may require that the violator be temporarily or permanently prohibited from engaging in any activity in the field of film production, and that the legal or natural person representing them be compelled to pay the fine jointly with the violator.
