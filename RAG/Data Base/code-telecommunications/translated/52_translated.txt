Radio equipment of all types may be provisionally seized, without compensation, by a decision of the Minister in charge of Communications, upon the proposal of the Minister of National Defense or the Minister of the Interior, whenever the use of such equipment is likely to violate national defense and public security requirements, after hearing the owner of the equipment. The same measures may be taken in all cases where the use of such equipment results in interference with radio communications or when such use is not in conformity with the conditions stipulated in the license. The Ministries of National Defense and the Interior, each within its competence, whenever the use of radio equipment is likely to violate national defense and public security requirements, shall search for hidden stations and monitor their content. (The last paragraph has been repealed and replaced by Article 1 of Law No. 10 of 2013, dated April 12, 2013).
