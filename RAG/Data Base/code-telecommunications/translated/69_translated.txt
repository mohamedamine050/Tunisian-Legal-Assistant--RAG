The National Communications Authority, within its purview, is responsible for imposing penalties on telecommunications network operators and communications service providers who are found to have violated the legislative and regulatory provisions related to the field of telecommunications or the decisions of the National Communications Authority, following the following procedures:

1. **Issuance of a warning:** The President of the National Communications Authority shall issue a warning to the violator, either orally or in writing, to cease the unlawful practices within a period not exceeding one month.
2. **Non-compliance with the warning:** If the violator fails to comply with the warning within the specified time frame, the National Communications Authority may issue an order to immediately cease the practices or impose specific conditions for the continuation of their activity.
3. **Non-compliance with the order:** If the violator fails to comply with the order mentioned above, the National Communications Authority shall impose a financial penalty, not exceeding 3% of their turnover for the preceding fiscal year, excluding payments (Repealed and replaced by Chapter I of Law No. 10 of 2013 dated April 12, 2013). The Authority may authorize the publication of decisions imposing penalties on public telecommunications network operators or communications service providers at the expense of the party against whom the judgment is issued, in newspapers of its choice (Added by Chapter 2 of Law No. 10 of 2013 dated April 12, 2013).
4. **Suspension of activity:** If investigations and inquiries reveal that the violation poses a threat to the normal operation of the telecommunications sector, the National Communications Authority shall issue a decision to suspend the activity related to this field for a period not exceeding three months. The activity cannot be resumed until the violation is rectified.  
5. **Criminal offenses:** If investigations establish the existence of a misdemeanor or an offense that warrants criminal prosecution, the National Communications Authority shall refer the case to the competent public prosecutor for the initiation of criminal proceedings, if necessary.
