If the easement rights referred to in Article 43 of this Code result in the removal or alteration of structures without the consensual agreement of their owners or any one of them, such properties may be expropriated in accordance with the applicable legislation.  After the preparation of these properties in accordance with this Code and the regulations enacted for its implementation, the network operator may sell the expropriated properties, provided that the purchasers respect the changes made and preserve the easement rights introduced on the property. The owners of the expropriated properties shall have the right of pre-emption to purchase within a period of three months from the date they are notified of the network operator's intention to sell by a bailiff, on condition that they undertake to respect the changes made to them and to preserve the easement rights stipulated in Article 43 of this Code.
