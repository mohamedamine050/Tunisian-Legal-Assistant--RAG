If the maritime authority receives a complaint from the crew regarding the seaworthiness of the vessel, or the guarantee of its condition, or concerning accommodation facilities, health protection, or provisioning, the maritime authority shall, as soon as possible, appoint one or more members of a **committee**  -  established through a formal procedure for assembling individuals with relevant experience from different parts of the organization - to inspect and ensure the safety guarantee in order to verify the validity of the complaint and take the necessary measures, if required. The complaint must be submitted in writing to the maritime authority and be **justified**, consisting of a clear explanation of the reasons for filing the complaint and signed by a representative of the crew or by three of its members. The complaint should be submitted in a timely manner so as not to delay the departure of the vessel.
