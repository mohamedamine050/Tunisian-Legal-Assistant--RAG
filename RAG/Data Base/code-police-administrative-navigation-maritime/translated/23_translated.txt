No vessel may fly a flag unless it possesses a Tunisian nationality document and a license. The Tunisian flag shall be flown at the stern of the vessel or above its aft mast. Flags of companies or vessel outfitters, in addition to the Tunisian flag, shall not be flown for the first time until a declaration to that effect has been submitted to the authority and recorded in the crew register. These flags shall be flown at the bow of the vessel and, if necessary, under the Tunisian flag on the same mast.
