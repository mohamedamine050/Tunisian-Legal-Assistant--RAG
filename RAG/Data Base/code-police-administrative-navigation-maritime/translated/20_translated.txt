The provisions concerning fraud in a nationality document shall apply to any fraud that may occur in a visa.  

Nationality is a legal and political link between an individual and a specific state, which includes the individual in the population that constitutes the state. This link creates mutual rights and obligations between them.  

Specifically, in relation to visas, the provisions of Articles Fourteen, Fifteen, and Sixteen of this Code shall apply.
