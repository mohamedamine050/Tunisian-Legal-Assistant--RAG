Temporary safety certificates shall be issued to new vessels constructed in Tunisia that are required to depart the place of construction to complete their facilities or outfitting in an outfitting port, where the remaining necessary examinations for obtaining the definitive safety certificates will be carried out. The same applies to vessels constructed or purchased in foreign countries that are sent on their maiden voyage to Tunisia and are authorized to fly the Tunisian flag. As soon as the vessel reaches a Tunisian port, the temporary safety certificate shall be withdrawn, and its owner shall complete the procedures stipulated by this Code to obtain the required documents.
