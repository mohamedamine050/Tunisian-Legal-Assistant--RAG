The minutes drawn up by the officials mentioned in Chapter Sixty-Nine of this Code must be signed by them. They are exempt from being personally drafted by them and constitute proof until the contrary is proven. The minutes shall state the date, place, and time of the violation, its nature, the names, descriptions, and addresses of the inspectors, as well as the name and address of the official drafting the minutes, if applicable, the names, descriptions, and addresses of the violators, and the names of the vessels involved in the violation. If the violators are present during the drafting of the minutes, the content shall be read to them and they shall be requested to sign it. In the event that they refuse to sign or declare that they cannot sign, this shall be stated in the minutes. If the violators are absent, this shall be stated in the minutes, along with the reason for their absence. If no minutes are drawn up or if the document is incomplete, the violations may be proven by means of the general law.
