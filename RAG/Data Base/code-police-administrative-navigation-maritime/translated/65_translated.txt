No person shall be appointed to a vessel subject to the provisions of this Code to perform the duties of master, mate, watchkeeping officer, chief engineer, or watchkeeping engineer if he is not Tunisian and has not obtained a certificate attesting to his competence to perform such duties, issued by or approved by the Minister in charge of Maritime Commerce. 

An order shall determine the minimum age of candidates for these duties, the required industrial experience, and the conditions for admission to the examinations that qualify each category to obtain a certificate of competence.

The Minister in charge of Maritime Commerce may decide to exempt, fully or partially, vessels with a gross tonnage of less than five hundred tons from the provisions of this Chapter. The Minister in charge of Maritime Commerce may also, by way of exception, exempt vessels exceeding five hundred gross tons from these provisions, if there is force majeure.
