The owner of a vessel has the right to change the port of registry of their vessel. For this purpose, they must submit a request to the Minister responsible for maritime trade. (1) See Decree No. 1001 of 1974, dated 16 November 1974.

If the vessel's nationality documentation and the license are in order, the maritime trade authorities shall issue a document confirming the request and inform the relevant maritime areas.  Article 57 (bis) (added by Law No. 4 of 2004, dated 20 January 2004).

Except in cases of necessity, and upon prior notification to the maritime units of the National Guard, vessels equipped with an engine and exceeding five gross tons in size must anchor in designated ports or coastal maritime locations. The competent governor shall define the territory of these coastal maritime locations. In all cases, the owner or operator of the vessel shall bear the responsibility for its safeguarding.
