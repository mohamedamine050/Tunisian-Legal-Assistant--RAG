The provisions of this chapter apply to foreign vessels entering Tunisian ports. These vessels must comply with the requirements of this chapter if the captain presents legal documents issued by the government of a country bound by the international conventions in force for the protection of human life at sea and conforming to those conventions. These documents shall be considered sufficient unless there are clear grounds for believing that the condition of the vessel or its equipment is not fundamentally in accordance with the information contained in those documents and that its departure would expose its passengers and crew to danger. In such a case, the maritime authority shall take all necessary measures to prevent the vessel from sailing and shall immediately inform the consul of the country of registration of the vessel in writing of the decision taken and the reasons that led to it.
