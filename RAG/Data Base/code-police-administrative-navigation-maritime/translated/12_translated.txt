**(Amended by Article 1 of Law No. 4 of 2004 dated January 20, 2004)**

The owner of every vessel equal to or exceeding twenty gross tons in size shall submit to the maritime authority a declaration and guarantee document. The form of the declaration and guarantee document shall be determined by a decision of the Minister responsible for commercial shipping. No claim for payment of the guarantee shall be made except in the event of fraud relating to the nationality document. The owner of every vessel less than twenty gross tons in size shall be exempt from providing a guarantee. The license, and as the case may be, the nationality document, shall be delivered to the vessel's owner by the maritime authority of the port of registry.
