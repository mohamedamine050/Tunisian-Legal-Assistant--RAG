The validity of safety assurance documents shall be for a period not exceeding:

- One year for the navigation license. 
- Five years for the minimum freeboard certificate.
- The legal period stipulated by international agreements for safety assurance documents applicable to international voyages.

The inspection of lifting equipment, the delivery of the inspection record, and the attestation of its validity may be entrusted by the Minister responsible for merchant shipping to a classification society.

The validity shall cease upon the cessation of any of the conditions required for its acquisition following a major breakdown or a substantial change in the structure or equipment of the vessel. The validity of safety assurance documents granted to a vessel classified by a classification society shall also cease upon the withdrawal of the standard issued by that society.

In the event that the validity of the safety assurance documents expires during the voyage of the vessel, it shall be deemed to be extended during the voyage until the vessel reaches the first port where the maritime authority is represented. To enable the vessel to continue its voyage, the validity of the document may be extended by the maritime authority. An extension may be requested before the start of the voyage if the outfitter of the vessel anticipates that the validity will expire before the end of the voyage.
