The Public Prosecution, at the request of the Minister in charge of Maritime Trade, shall institute public action, without prejudice to the rights of the private party. The violations stipulated in this Code shall be judged without any notification of the ordinary rules of jurisdiction. However, if the violation occurred at sea, the competent court shall be the court of the port where the ship is registered or to which it was brought.  The proceedings must be initiated within twelve months following the day the violation was observed. In the absence of proceedings within that period, the public action, as well as other actions, shall be extinguished by lapse of time.
