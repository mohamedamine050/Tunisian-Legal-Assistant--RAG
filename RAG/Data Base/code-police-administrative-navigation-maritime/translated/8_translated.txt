The vessel's tonnage constitutes the official proof of its cargo capacity. The Maritime Authority of the port of registration is responsible for determining the tonnage and drawing up the list of additional facilities. A certificate is issued following these processes, and it is typically at the expense of the vessel's owner or builder.  Those responsible for carrying out these processes are entitled to be provided with the necessary means to complete them. No special fees are levied for these processes, except for actual expenses.
