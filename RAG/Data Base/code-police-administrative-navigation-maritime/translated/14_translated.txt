In the event of the loss of a ship's nationality document, its owner may, upon confirming its loss by sworn statement, file a lawsuit to obtain a replacement. The ship owner is required to complete the same procedures, provide guarantees, submit offers and declarations, and pay the necessary fees and dues to obtain the original nationality document. The sworn statement is accepted and referred to in accordance with the provisions of Chapter Eleven of this Code.

When the matter concerns the re-granting of Tunisian nationality to a ship previously deregistered from the Tunisian registry following its transfer to a foreign country, the owner must complete the same procedures and comply with the same obligations required to obtain the original nationality document.
