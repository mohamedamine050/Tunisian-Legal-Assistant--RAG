A Central Safety Assurance Committee is established, constituted as a formal mechanism for bringing together individuals with relevant expertise from various parts of the institution, under the authority of the Minister responsible for Merchant Shipping. The Committee is tasked with verifying the designs imposed by a ministerial decision issued by the Minister responsible for Merchant Shipping, which are required by the shipâ€™s outfitter during construction, modification of equipment, or upon purchase from a foreign country, if the vessel is being imported. All safety or security equipment presented for verification, as well as all fittings, cabinets, and machinery that the shipbuilder or outfitter wishes to have recognized as equivalent to legal fittings, cabinets, or machinery, must be submitted to the Central Safety Assurance Committee. 

The Minister responsible for Merchant Shipping may consult this Committee regarding any matter related to the preservation of human life at sea or the accommodation facilities on merchant, fishing, or pleasure vessels, and, generally, on all matters relating to the application of this Code.
