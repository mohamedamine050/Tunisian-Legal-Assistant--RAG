Any vessel, prior to its departure from a Tunisian port, may be subject to a departure inspection. The purpose of this inspection is to ensure that the vessel is generally in good condition, suitable for sailing, and that the measures stipulated in this Code and the regulations in force have been taken to guarantee the safety of the vessel, its crew, and the persons on board. The maritime authority has the right to prevent or postpone the departure of any vessel if it finds that its sailing presents risks to the crew or persons on board, due to its age, instability, loading method, or for any other reason stipulated in this Code or the regulations in force. The master shall be immediately and in writing informed of the reasons for the prevention or postponement of departure. Should the master refuse to comply, the maritime authority shall request the port authorities to prevent the vessel from sailing.
