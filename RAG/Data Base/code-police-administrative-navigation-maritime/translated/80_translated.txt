The owner or operator of a vessel who proceeds to relocate it after being denied a safety certificate or after the vessel's operation has been suspended shall be subject to a fine of three thousand dinars if the vessel's gross tonnage is equal to or exceeds one hundred tons, and a fine of one thousand dinars if it is less than that. The same punishment applies to the vessel's captain, provided that the punishment imposed on the captain may be reduced by one quarter of the punishment imposed on the owner or operator of the vessel if it is proven that he received a written order to do so from the owner or operator of the vessel.
