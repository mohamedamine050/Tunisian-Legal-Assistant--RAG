Every Tunisian vessel shall be subject to the following inspections to ensure safety:

1) Initial Use Inspection: Every Tunisian vessel
shall, before commencing use, be subject to a thorough inspection to the fullest extent possible. This inspection shall include, in particular, an inspection of the vesselâ€™s hull in dry dock to facilitate the issuance of safety certificates, whether it concerns new vessels or vessels undergoing Tunisian registration.

2) Periodic Inspections: Every vessel, when applying for renewal of safety certificates, shall be subject to an inspection aimed at verifying that it still meets the legal requirements. This inspection shall be conducted while the vessel is afloat, unless the maritime authority deems otherwise, in which case it may always require the inspection to be conducted in dry dock. In the case of an inspection while the vessel is afloat, the maritime authority may order the partial or complete unloading of the vessel. | Every vessel intended for the carriage of passengers shall be subject to an inspection of its outer hull in dry dock at least once every twelve months. Other vessels shall be subject to an inspection of their outer hull in dry dock at least once every two years if they have a metal hull, and at least once every three years if they have a wooden hull.

3) Exceptional Inspections: The maritime authority may subject any vessel to a safety inspection whenever it deems it useful. Every vessel whose safety certificates have been withdrawn or whose operation has been temporarily suspended pursuant to the provisions of Article 29 of this Code, shall be subject to a new safety inspection before being put back into service.
