To facilitate the issuance of temporary documents as provided for in Chapter Twenty-six of this Code, the Safety Assurance Inspection Committee may, if it deems it beneficial, commence its work at the foreign port where the vessel is located and conduct the technical inspections required under this Chapter. In this instance, the vessel's outfitter shall bear the costs of transporting the Committee members. In the event of confirmation, the consular authority shall constitute a committee 
in a formal manner by gathering individuals with relevant expertise from various parts of the institution. Its composition shall, as far as possible, approximate the composition of the 
Safety Assurance Inspection Committee.
