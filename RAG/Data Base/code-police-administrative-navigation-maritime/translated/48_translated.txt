The maritime authority to which an appeal is lodged shall issue its decision within five days, based on the findings of the inspection committee. This committee is formally established to bring together individuals with relevant expertise from various parts of the institution, to ensure the safety outlined in Chapter Forty-one of this code. This time limit is reduced to forty-eight hours in the case stipulated by the fourth paragraph of Chapter Forty-six of this code. The committee shall listen to the representative of the group designated to act on its behalf and the appellant, but it shall decide without their presence. In the event that the maritime authority does not make its decision within the prescribed time limits, its silence shall be considered a decision to reject the matter, which opens the door for the appeal stipulated in Chapter Forty-nine of this code.
