**I.**

- 1) Subject to Value Added Tax (VAT) are alcoholic beverages delivered to all natural or legal persons, especially those mentioned in paragraph III of Chapter II above, as well as to bottlers, with the exception of the National Wine Office.

- 2) The VAT applicable to locally produced alcoholic beverages is collected, except for those destined for a vinegar factory upon delivery by the National Wine Office. 

**II.** Alcoholic beverages are subject to VAT upon supply under the conditions stipulated in paragraph II of Chapter VI above.

However, imported alcoholic beverages received by the National Wine Office are accepted with a deferment of VAT application.

**III.** The transfer of any quantity of bulk alcoholic beverages is only authorized with a transit permit issued by the Tax Administration.

Recipients of alcoholic beverages must keep the transit permits issued to them in order to justify the quantities of alcoholic beverages in their possession.

Transit permits are not required for alcoholic beverages directed from the production site to the bottling unit when the latter is located at the production site. However, these deliveries require the issuance of a delivery note for each transfer.
