(Added by Article 55 of Law No. 70 of 2007 dated December 27, 2007). â€“ Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 5, paragraph 3 of this Code, Value Added Tax (VAT) shall be paid for the exploitation of markets within the framework of a lease, within the deadline set for the payment of refunds to local communities. In this case, the amounts paid are considered to be a release from the payment of VAT due on the turnover of market tenants, and it is the obligation to declare the VAT on the basis of these operations. This does not confer the right to deduction provided for in Article 9 of this Code.
