## Conflict of Interest, Declaration of Assets, and Gifts

**Section One - Conflict of Interest**

When a public servant feels they are in a situation of conflict of interest or fears they may be, they must immediately inform their direct superior. If the existence of a conflict of interest is established, the superior will take appropriate action to resolve it.

Any public servant, regardless of their rank, must, upon assuming their duties, declare in writing to their direct superior any private interests that could potentially conflict with the obligations entrusted to them.

**Section Two - Declaration of Assets**

Upon assuming a specific position or role, a public servant is subject to a duty to declare on their honor all their own assets, as well as those of their spouse and minor children, whether movable or immovable, as determined by law or relevant regulations.

This declaration must be updated or renewed periodically, as per the timeframes specified by law or relevant regulations. Moreover, public servants must declare their assets upon the conclusion of their duties.

**Section Three - Gifts, Benefits, and Other Advantages**

Public servants are prohibited from requesting, requiring, or accepting gifts, donations, or benefits of any kind, either for themselves or for the benefit of others, that could potentially have a direct or indirect influence on their objectivity in performing their duties.

**Section Four - Concurrent Activities**

The status of a public servant is incompatible with any activity that conflicts with the honor of their profession or hinders the performance of their duties.

Public servants are not permitted to engage in any other remunerated concurrent activity without authorization granting them the right to combine activities within the framework of the laws and regulations governing their primary activity.
