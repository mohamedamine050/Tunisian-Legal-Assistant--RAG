Tax offenses are examined, tracked, and extracted.  Public funds are collected by the state in the form of payments, where a payment is a cash amount paid by individuals and companies proportionally to their income or profits.

Offenses related to taxes, duties, and payments referred to in this Code are examined, tracked, and extracted according to the procedures followed in each article.  Offenses related to the proportional tax are also examined, tracked, and extracted, except for those related to late payment penalties and profit tax, as is the case in the articles concerning the income tax on individuals and corporate tax. Partial or total omissions identified in the proportional tax base and the profit tax base, as well as errors made in applying their rates, may be rectified until the end of the fifteenth year following the year for which the tax is due.
