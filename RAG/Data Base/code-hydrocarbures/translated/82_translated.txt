1. 82.  The transportation tariffs relating to production originating from exploitation fields other than those owned by the license holder under the concession right are set by the license holder and submitted to the granting authority for approval. These tariffs shall include, in particular, for a specific user of the equipment, a percentage based on the accounting consumption of the installations and pipelines, and a profit margin similar to the limits generally agreed upon in the petroleum industry for equipment and pipelines used in similar circumstances.

2. 82. The tariffs referred to in this chapter must be submitted to the administration at least two months before they come into effect.  During this period, the administration may object to the proposed tariffs. If there are significant changes to the elements constituting these tariffs, the license holder shall set new tariffs taking those changes into account and submit them to the administration for approval.

3. 82. The license holder who undertakes transportation operations on behalf of license holders, pursuant to the provisions of this title, shall consider these operations for tax purposes as activities exploiting his or her concession(s). The tax treatment is subject to the approval of the granting authority before its application.
