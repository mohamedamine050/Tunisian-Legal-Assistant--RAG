**Article 58**

1. Upon the expiry, relinquishment, or revocation of the exploitation concession, the concession reverts to the granting authority without relieving the licensee from their obligations, particularly those stipulated in Articles 118 to 123 of this Code. Furthermore, the properties referred to in the first paragraph of Article 53 of this Code are transferred to the granting authority in accordance with the terms specified in the relevant agreement.

2. However, upon the expiry of the exploitation concession, the licensee has the right of preemption to continue the exploitation under the same terms and conditions as the granting authority would be eligible to contract with a third party. The licensee shall exercise the aforementioned right of preemption within a period not exceeding sixty days from the date of notification of the aforementioned terms and conditions.
