Foreign nationals who are non-residents prior to their assignment or attachment to Tunisia and who are appointed to carry out exploration, research, and exploitation activities may:

A. Choose a social security system other than the Tunisian system, in which case neither the employer nor the employee is required to pay social security contributions in Tunisia.

B. Benefit from exemption from tax on income of natural persons with respect to wages and salaries paid to them. In return, they are subject to a provisional tax contribution of 20% of the gross amount of the allowance, including the value of in-kind benefits.  To benefit from these provisions, a certificate issued by the Minister responsible for hydrocarbons is required.

C. Benefit from a temporary exemption from duties and taxes levied upon the importation of personal belongings and a private passenger car. The transfer of the imported car or belongings (1) to a resident is subject to foreign trade procedures and the payment of duties and taxes in effect at the date of transfer, calculated on the basis of the value of the car and/or belongings at that date.
