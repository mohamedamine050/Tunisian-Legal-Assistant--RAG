An application for an exploitation concession shall not be accepted unless it relates to an area composed of a whole number of contiguous primary perimeters containing the discovery which is entirely located within the perimeter of the license from which the exploitation concession arises. However, an exploitation concession application defined by an international boundary and thus including parts of primary perimeters may be accepted.
