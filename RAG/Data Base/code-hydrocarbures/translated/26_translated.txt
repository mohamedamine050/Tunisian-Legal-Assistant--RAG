**Article 26**

1. The area of a research license renewal cannot exceed eighty percent of the original total area plus any increase in area at the first renewal. Upon a second renewal, the area of the license cannot exceed sixty-four percent of the original total area plus any increase that may have occurred. 

2. The licensee shall, at their discretion, determine the areas to be relinquished and shall notify the relevant authority of these areas within their renewal application. In case of non-compliance, the granting authority shall automatically determine these areas.

3. A research license initially consisting of a single plot may, upon renewal, include a maximum of three plots, connected or unconnected. Each plot must consist of a whole number of original perimeters within a single block of regular geometric shape. However, a renewal application containing portions of original perimeters may be accepted if the aforementioned plot or plots are bordered by an international boundary.
