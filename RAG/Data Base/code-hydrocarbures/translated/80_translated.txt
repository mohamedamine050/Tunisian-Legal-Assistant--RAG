## English Translation:

**Article 80:** 

1. In the absence of a mutually agreed agreement, the granting authority may oblige the licensee operating licensed transport pipelines pursuant to Article 76 of this Code to accept the transportation of hydrocarbons of a type compatible with its own production and originating from other concessions other than those that justified the establishment of these pipelines. This shall be done within the limits of its capacity to absorb surplus and for a specified duration.
2. This transportation shall not lead to any discrimination in favor of other licensees, particularly in the field of tariffs. The licensee shall ensure that this transportation is carried out under the same quality, regularity, and pumping rate standards that characterize the transportation of its own production. 
3. The granting authority may grant a license to a public or private entity to construct and operate facilities for storing and transporting hydrocarbons through pipelines on behalf of licensees.
4. Services provided by the operator of hydrocarbon storage and transportation facilities to concession holders for exploitation shall benefit from the exemptions granted to handling institutions contracted by licensees as stipulated in special agreements and the applicable provisions of this Code.
