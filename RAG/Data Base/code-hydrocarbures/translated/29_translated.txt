The renewal of the exploration license is granted from the date of its expiry by a decision of the Minister in charge of hydrocarbons. This decision is taken based on an opinion of approval issued by the Hydrocarbon Advisory Committee and published in the Official Gazette of the Tunisian Republic. However, if the administration does not rule on the application for license renewal before the expiry of its validity period, it is implicitly extended without further procedures until the issuance of the Minister's decision.
