(Amended by Law No. 15 of 2008 dated February 18, 2008)

No exploration license may be granted to any entity except in partnership with the National Institution. The specific agreement shall determine the percentage share of the National Institution. The partner(s) of the National Institution shall bear solely the expenses and risks of carrying out exploration and research activities. However, the National Institution may, in certain cases, choose to contribute to the expenses of exploration or research operations, subject to the approval of the granting authority.
