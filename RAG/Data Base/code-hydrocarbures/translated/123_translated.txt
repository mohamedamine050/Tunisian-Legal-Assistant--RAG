## English Translation of the Arabic Legal Text:

1. **Article 123:** The License Holder may be exempted from the obligation to rehabilitate the site if they cease exploitation activities due to relinquishing the exploitation concession or due to its cancellation upon expiry of the term. This exemption applies provided that the remaining economically profitable exploitation period for the concession is not less than five years for offshore exploitation or three years for onshore exploitation, and provided that the continued exploitation of the field throughout the remaining term allows for the covering of all obligations, including the costs of site rehabilitation, and guarantees reasonable profits. 

2. **Article 123:** If the Granting Authority deems that these conditions are not met, it may, at its discretion, require the License Holder to either contribute to the rehabilitation of the site or to continue exploiting the field, regardless of any contradictory provisions in this Code.

3. **Article 123:** In the event of cancellation of the exploitation concession in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 57 of this Code, and if the Granting Authority deems that the economic conditions stipulated in the first paragraph of this Chapter are not met, it may require the License Holder to contribute to the costs of site rehabilitation. In the event of disagreement on the amount of the contribution stipulated in paragraph 2 of this Chapter and this paragraph, this amount may be determined by an independent expert approved by both the Granting Authority and the License Holder.

4. **Article 123:** In all cases, the Granting Authority may, at any time, require the License Holder to provide a guarantee in its favor covering the implementation of abandonment and rehabilitation operations at the exploitation site. This guarantee remains valid as long as the Granting Authority deems that the obligations related to the implementation of abandonment and rehabilitation operations at the exploitation site have not been fully respected. It is understood that providing this guarantee, if required, does not exempt the License Holder from the obligations related to abandonment and rehabilitation of the exploitation site.
