## English Translation:

**Article 44** 

1. The licensee, in order to exercise his right to obtain the exploitation concession provided for in Article 41 of this Code, must submit a concession application within a maximum period of two months before the expiry date of the license under which the discovery was made, and within a maximum period of twelve months after the completion of the evaluation works or exploration works that have demonstrated that the discovery is economically exploitable. If this is not possible, the granting authority may require the licensee to transfer the discovery to it without any compensation.

2. The granting authority may require the licensee to transfer to it, without any compensation, a discovery that it considers to be economically exploitable, if the licensee fails to develop the discovery within a maximum period of six years for a liquid hydrocarbon discovery and eight years for a gaseous hydrocarbon discovery, commencing from the date of discovery. For the purposes of this Article, the date of discovery shall be the date of completion of the production tests referred to in Article 2 of this Code and carried out at the well, which have demonstrated the accumulation of the hydrocarbons constituting the discovery. In any case, the granting authority may, at the request of the licensee under whose license the discovery was made, extend the deadlines set out in this Article if it considers that the economic circumstances no longer allow for the respect of those deadlines.
