The licensee is obligated to comply with the procedures determined by the granting authority in accordance with the provisions of this Code and the regulations adopted for its implementation.

In the event of imminent danger—imminent danger being defined as an immediate and acutely impending threat to persons and property that cannot be ignored—the agents of the hydrocarbons authority shall immediately take the necessary measures to eliminate the danger. They may, if necessary, request the local authorities to undertake all necessary requisitions for this purpose. The expenses incurred within the framework of these operations shall be borne by the licensee.
