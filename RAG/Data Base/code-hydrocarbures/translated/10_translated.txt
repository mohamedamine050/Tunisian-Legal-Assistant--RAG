## English Translation of Arabic Legal Text:

**Article 10**

1. Exploration licenses are granted by a decision of the Minister in charge of hydrocarbons, based on an opinion of approval issued by the Hydrocarbons Advisory Committee, to any person who meets the conditions stipulated in Article 7 of this Code, for a period of two years. Extensions to the validity of the exploration license may be granted for a period not exceeding twelve months in total, upon a reasoned request from the license holder. This extension of the validity of the exploration license shall be granted by a decision of the Minister in charge of hydrocarbons, based on an opinion of approval issued by the Hydrocarbons Advisory Committee. 

2. Exploration licenses shall not be granted in an area that is still subject to prior exploration or search licenses and/or a prior exploitation concession. If an overlap occurs and is confirmed after the granting of an exploration license, the correction of the boundaries of this license shall be made by a decision taken by the Minister in charge of hydrocarbons automatically or at the request of the party concerned. 

3. An application for an exploration license shall not be accepted unless it relates to an area consisting of a whole number of primary perimeters as defined in paragraph two of Article 13 of this Code. However, an application for an exploration license defined by an international boundary and consequently including parts of primary perimeters may be accepted.

4. The holder of an exploration license is obliged to pay the fixed fee stipulated in subparagraph one of Article 101 of this Code. They shall undertake to bear the costs and carry out geological and geophysical work in accordance with the conditions stipulated in paragraph five of Article 10 of this Code (1). 

5. The exploration license grants its holder, to the exclusion of all others, the right to carry out exploration work in the area specified by the grant decision, with the exception of all drilling operations other than those intended to obtain geological or seismic samples, the depth of which does not exceed three hundred meters (300m).

6. The Minister in charge of hydrocarbons may issue a decision to revoke an exploration license if its holder undertakes activities other than those specified in paragraph five of this Article. The decision to revoke the exploration license shall be issued after granting its holder a reasonable period to submit observations on the irregularities committed, and after taking into account the opinion of the Hydrocarbons Advisory Committee in this regard.

7. At the expiry of the validity period of the exploration license, its holder must have delivered to the granting authority a copy of the seismic survey records, studies and all information obtained during the execution of the work.

8. The holder of an exploration license who has not fulfilled the obligations imposed on them by the provisions of paragraph seven of Article 10 above shall not be entitled to another exploration license or search license, nor shall they benefit from interests in any exploration or search licenses or exploitation concessions in force.

9. The holder of an exploration license has the right of priority to convert their license into a search license, subject to the fulfillment of the obligations incumbent upon them under this Article and the conditions agreed upon in advance by the granting authority and the beneficiary. To exercise this right, the holder of the exploration license must request the granting authority to convert their license into a search license within a period of two months before the expiry date of said license. The search license shall be granted from the day following the expiry of the validity of the exploration license. However, if the granting authority has not ruled on the application to convert the exploration license into a search license within the two-month period stipulated in paragraph two of Article 9.10 of this Code, the validity of the exploration license shall be extended without the need to take any further action until the decision of the Minister in charge of hydrocarbons is issued, provided that this extension does not exceed six additional months. (Paragraph three added by Law No. 23 of 2002 dated February 14, 2002).

10. The rights and obligations relating to the holders of search licenses as stipulated in the provisions of this Code and its implementing texts shall apply to the holder of an exploration license when carrying out work related to their license.

11. The methods of filing an application for an exploration license, its examination and its possible conversion into a search license shall be determined by a decision of the Minister in charge of hydrocarbons.
