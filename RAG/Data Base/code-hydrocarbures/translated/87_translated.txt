Wells may not be dug at a distance of less than fifty meters from residential properties, facilities, or other buildings, as well as adjacent land enclosed by walls, except with the consent of their owners. If no agreement is reached by mutual consent, the licensing procedures stipulated in Article 85 of this Code may be invoked. However, the license holder is required, before the completion of excavation works, to present the measures taken to ensure the safety of these buildings and their occupants to the granting authority for its approval.
