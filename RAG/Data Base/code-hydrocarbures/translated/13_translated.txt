**Article 13**

1. An application for a research license shall not be accepted unless it pertains to an area composed of a whole number of contiguous primary squares. However, an application for a research license defined by an international boundary and consequently encompassing parts of primary squares may be accepted.

2. The primary squares referred to in the preceding paragraph shall be square in shape, each having an area of four square kilometers. The sides of these squares shall be oriented geographically according to the North-South and East-West directions, and shall be composed of segments of parallel lines and dividing lines. Their angles shall be determined by geographical coordinates and by the numbers of the markers to be established by an order published in the Official Gazette of the Tunisian Republic.
