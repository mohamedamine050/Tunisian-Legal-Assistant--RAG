Oil and gas service companies exercise their activities as resident or non-resident entities.  Oil and gas service companies subject to Tunisian law are considered non-resident when at least sixty-six percent of their capital is owned by non-resident Tunisians or foreigners, subscribed through the inflow of convertible currency.  The contribution of resident individuals to the capital of these companies is made according to the prevailing exchange regulations. The company's articles of association must clearly indicate its non-resident status. Non-resident oil and gas service companies are not required to repatriate the proceeds of their exports carried out within the framework of the activities referred to in Article 1.130 of this Code; however, they are required to pay for goods purchased and services rendered in Tunisia, and to pay taxes, duties, fees, and profit shares distributed to resident partners, through a foreign account in foreign currency or convertible dinars. Branches established in Tunisia are considered legal entities and, having their registered offices abroad, are considered non-resident with regard to exchange regulations. The contribution of the registered office of these branches must be financed by the inflow of convertible currency.
