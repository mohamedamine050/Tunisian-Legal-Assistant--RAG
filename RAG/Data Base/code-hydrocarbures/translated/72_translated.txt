**Regarding the Domestic Market**

**1.72** In the event of an agreement between the granting authority and the licensee to develop a gas discovery dedicated wholly or partially to the domestic market, a supply agreement shall be concluded under the supervision of the granting authority between the licensee and the entity or entities entrusted with the distribution of gas in Tunisia, which are designated by the granting authority.  

**2.72** The supply agreement shall define the obligations of the contracting parties in the field of delivering and receiving commercial gas, and the agreed upon obligations shall be based on fairness and reciprocity between the seller and the buyer.  The agreement shall specify, in particular, the duration of the obligation, quantities, quality specifications, and the point of delivery of the commercial gas.  If the agreement is concluded for a long duration and if the development of the discoveries is primarily dedicated to the domestic market, the agreement may include, at the request of the licensee, a clause obligating the buyer to pay a portion of the price in the event of failure to receive the contracted quantities.  In this case, the agreement shall specify a reciprocal obligation to deliver gas or an obligation to compensate the buyer in the event of failure to deliver the contracted quantities, with this compensation obligation being limited to three consecutive years.  If the non-delivery persists for more than three years, the buyer shall be relieved of the obligation to pay for the gas that was not delivered.

**3.72** The price of gas sold to the domestic market shall be paid in Tunisian dinars and foreign currency according to the proportions established by the sales and purchase contracts concluded between the licensee and the entity or entities entrusted with the distribution of gas in Tunisia.
