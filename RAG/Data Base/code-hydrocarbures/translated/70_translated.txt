1. 70. The granting authority may request the licensee to transfer the discovery to the National Corporation if the licensee does not notify the granting authority of the development decision within four years following the discovery of a gas field capable of producing commercially exploitable quantities, after fulfilling its own needs. 

2. 70. In exchange, the National Corporation shall pay the licensee annually twenty percent (20%) of the net profits resulting from the exploitation. These profits shall be calculated on the basis of revenues, based on the referral price determined in Article 73 of this Code and on the basis of development and exploitation costs incurred in the field by the Libyan National Oil Corporation. 

3. 70. The National Corporation shall be relieved of all obligations towards the licensee when the total amount paid reaches a maximum limit equal to one and a half times the licensee's expenses directly related to the gas discovery or when the exploitation ends and the payments made have not reached this maximum limit.

4. 70. Expenses directly related to the discovery are considered to be: 
a) Evaluation costs following the discovery of the producing structure. 
b) Costs of drilling wells that led to the identification of the structure, as well as drilling costs including those incurred after the initial discovery of signs and aimed at defining the structure in question.
c) A share of seismic, geophysical, or other survey costs incurred on the license. This share shall be proportionate to the number of wells related to the structure in question compared to the total number of wells completed under the license up to the date of the decision to transfer the discovery to the National Corporation. The licensee may waive this payment mentioned above and choose to retain all costs for use in subsequent discoveries.
