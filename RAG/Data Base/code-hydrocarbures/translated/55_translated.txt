**Article 55**

1. The transfer, in whole or in part, of the rights of any partner in an exploitation permit, in whatever form such transfer may be, is prohibited, except with prior authorization from the granting authority. The transfer of an exploitation permit, in whole or in part, may only be made pursuant to a license issued by the Minister in charge of hydrocarbons based on a favorable opinion from the Hydrocarbon Advisory Committee. However, transfers between companies that are subsidiaries of each other are exempt from this license requirement; these transfers shall be subject to prior notification to the granting authority. 

2. If the exploitation permit is granted to partners who are license holders, the withdrawal of one or more of them shall not result in the cancellation of the exploitation permit as long as the remaining partner(s) take over the rights and obligations of the withdrawing partner(s) and notify the granting authority thereof. However, the remaining partners shall not be transferred the rights related to the accounting consumption and payment of expenses from the national entity in relation to the share of the withdrawing partner. In this case, the withdrawal shall be considered a transfer between the holders of the same permit, and this transfer shall be subject to the license provided for in this Chapter.

3. Any act contrary to this Chapter shall be deemed null and void and shall have no effect, and may result in the cancellation of the exploitation permit.

4. In the event that the transfer is subject to authorization from the granting authority, the national entity shall have the right of priority to acquire the rights related to the transfer under the same conditions and requirements as those obtained by the transferor, and the national entity shall be notified thereof no later than the date of filing the transfer application. In this case, in order not to lose its right of priority, the national entity must inform the transferor of its decision to exercise or not exercise this right within thirty days of the filing of the transfer application. 

5. In the event of a complete or partial transfer of the exploitation permit, the transferee shall assume all obligations of the transferor and shall enjoy all the rights related to the whole or to the part transferred to it, arising from the provisions of this Code and the special agreement.

6. The transfer shall take effect upon the signing of the transfer documents by the transferor and transferee, provided that the authorization of the granting authority is obtained. In all cases, the authorization of the transfer shall be granted by a decision of the Minister in charge of hydrocarbons, which shall be published in the Official Gazette of the Republic of Tunisia.

7. Any transfer in favor of a company incorporated under the legislation of any country that does not have diplomatic relations with the Republic of Tunisia, or a company whose registered office is located in one of these countries, even if the transferee is a branch of the transferor, shall be prohibited.

8. (Amended by Law No. 15 of 2008 dated February 18, 2008) The procedures for filing and examining the license application for the transfer of the exploitation permit and the obligations related thereto shall be determined by a decision of the Minister in charge of hydrocarbons.
