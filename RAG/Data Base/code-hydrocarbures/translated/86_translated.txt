## English Translation:

1. **Article 86.**  Every person whose private land is occupied as stipulated in Article 85 of this Code has the right to receive advance financial compensation. The amount of compensation is determined for the duration of the occupation, based on an annual sum equal to twice the rental value of the occupied land at the time of occupation, unless otherwise agreed upon. Disputes regarding the amount of this compensation are referred to the courts. Court judgments are always enforced provisionally and immediately, regardless of any appeal. Occupation may not take place until the financial compensation is paid or secured through the public treasury.  Furthermore, the license holder is obligated to compensate for any damage caused to the property by their activities or pay a financial penalty to compensate for the losses resulting from such damage.

2. **Article 86.** If the occupation of land deprives the owners of their right to dispose of it for a period exceeding three years, they may compel the license holder to purchase the aforementioned land.  In all cases, the purchase price is determined at twice the market value of the land at the time of its occupation. Disputes regarding the purchase price, except when both parties agree on a price exceeding or falling short of the sale value, are referred to the courts, which issue judgments that are provisionally enforceable regardless of any appeal. Occupation of the land cannot proceed until the relevant compensation is paid or secured through the public treasury.

3. **Article 86.** If, upon the completion of works, it is determined that the occupied land has suffered significant damage or its condition has deteriorated to the point where it cannot be used for the purpose for which it was intended, the license holder must either repair the damage or pay the owner compensation for the damage. The amount of this compensation cannot exceed twice the market value of the land in question. Disputes regarding the amount of compensation in these cases are referred to the courts.

4. **Article 86.** In cases where the execution of public or private works necessitates the removal or actual modification of the license holderâ€™s structures, the latter is entitled to receive compensation for the resulting damages. The amount of this compensation is determined by the courts based on an expert assessment authorized by the competent judge, unless both parties agree on the amount.
