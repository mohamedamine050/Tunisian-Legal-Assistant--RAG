1.  **Article 73.** The granting authority ensures, with respect to the needs of the local market, that commercial gas is marketed at a price determined by order. This price applies to commercial gas delivered at the entry point of the main gas transmission network belonging to the entity or entities responsible for gas distribution in Tunisia, designated by the granting authority. In the case of gas delivery at a point other than the aforementioned point, the gas price shall be adjusted accordingly.

2. **Article 73.** This price is valid when gas is used as fuel. However, when used as a raw material, the price shall be determined by agreement between the granting authority and the license holder, in a way that ensures the latter a fair return, taking into account the economic pressures specific to the industry utilizing this material. The license holder may request the granting authority to determine this price before evaluating and developing the discovery.
