## English Translation:

1. **Article 68:** Once the License Holder is able to provide binding estimates for the existing reserves and production forecasts associated with a discovery that it considers exploitable, it shall inform the Granting Authority thereof, so that the Granting Authority is aware of the quantities that can be guaranteed for marketing in the local market. 

2. **Article 68:** The Granting Authority shall inform the License Holder within six months of such notification of the quantities that it can guarantee for marketing, subject to the conditions specified in this Code. This guarantee by the Granting Authority shall be valid only if the License Holder commences, within six months, the implementation of the evaluation program referred to in Article 69 of this Code and informs the Granting Authority of the development decision within four years from the date of notification of the discovery. 

3. **Article 68:** Furthermore, the License Holder shall inform the Granting Authority of any new development that may significantly alter its binding estimates for the existing reserves and production forecasts, failing which the marketing commitment stipulated in the second paragraph of Article 68 of this Code shall be null and void.  The License Holder shall communicate this information as soon as possible by submitting a revised notification based on a new binding estimate, as defined in the first paragraph of this Article, in order to benefit from a marketing guarantee that takes into account the revised estimate.
