**Article 30**

1.  Based on a favorable opinion issued by the Advisory Committee for Hydrocarbons, the Minister in charge of Hydrocarbons may, upon request, extend the validity period of an exploration license or increase its area, or both, subject to the following conditions: 
    a) The license holder must submit their request at least two months before the expiration of the license validity period. 
    b) The extension must be for an additional period of two years or encompass an additional area not exceeding fifty percent (50%) of the original area of the exploration license.
    c) The commitments related to expenses and works must be adjusted based on the extension of the license period and the increase in its area, or either.

2.  Furthermore, based on a favorable opinion issued by the Advisory Committee for Hydrocarbons, the Minister in charge of Hydrocarbons may grant an additional one-year extension to the aforementioned extension, provided that the license holder demonstrates a compelling reason or obstacle that hindered the normal progress of their exploration activities.  The same one-year extension may also be granted to any exploration license holder, provided they undertake additional work commitments.

3.  Upon request, the license holder may also be granted an extension of no more than two years in case of hydrocarbon discovery during the final period of the license validity. This extension applies only to the area of the exploration license where the discovery is located, and is granted if the evaluation work stipulated in Article 40 of this Code cannot be carried out during the remaining validity period.

4.  The extension of the license period and the increase in its area, or either, as stipulated in this article, is granted by a decision issued by the Minister in charge of Hydrocarbons, based on a reasoned favorable opinion issued by the Advisory Committee for Hydrocarbons. This decision is published in the Official Gazette of the Tunisian Republic.

5.  The procedures for filing and examining the request for extension of the license period and increase in its area are established by a decision issued by the Minister in charge of Hydrocarbons.
