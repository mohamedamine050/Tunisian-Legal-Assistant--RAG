The holder of a prospecting license whose term has expired in the ordinary course, or which has been revoked or abandoned, cannot directly or indirectly obtain any rights in the areas covered by the license unless three years have elapsed from the date of its expiration, revocation, or abandonment. However, the Minister responsible for hydrocarbons may, at the request of the license holder and upon the issuance of a reasoned opinion of approval by the Hydrocarbons Advisory Committee, reduce this period, but not below six months.
