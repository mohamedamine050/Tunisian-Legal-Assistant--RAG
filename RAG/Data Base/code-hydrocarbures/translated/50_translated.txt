1. The granting authority shall have the right of first refusal to purchase a specific portion of liquid hydrocarbons production extracted by or on behalf of the license holder under the terms of their existing exploitation concession in Tunisia, for the purpose of meeting domestic market needs. The quantities to be allocated to the domestic market under this purchase shall be calculated based on the quantities produced by each exploitation concession, up to a maximum of twenty percent (20%). The price applied to these sales shall be the agreed price between the parties, unless it exceeds or falls short of the normal price at the point of delivery on board the vessel, which the license holder receives for its sales upon export, reduced by ten percent (10%). 

2. If the granting authority exercises its right of first refusal, the licensee shall ensure the delivery of the relevant quantities under the conditions specified in the notification and in accordance with the provisions stipulated in the specific agreement. The quantities delivered on this basis shall be considered domestic sales, particularly for the purposes of exchange control, and shall be paid for in Tunisian dinars, without prejudice to the license holderâ€™s rights regarding the transfer of surplus, as provided in Article 128 of this Code.
