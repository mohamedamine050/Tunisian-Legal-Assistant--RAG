Private lands may not be occupied except after obtaining the written consent of their owner. However, the licensee is authorized, in the event of no amicable agreement, to temporarily occupy the lands necessary for the completion of the works referred to in Article 84 of this Code, by a decision taken by the Minister in charge of hydrocarbons after hearing the landowner. The licensing decision shall be communicated to the landowner by a bailiff appointed by the licensee. It shall become immediately enforceable. However, the occupation of any plot located within a land enclosed by walls shall require the written consent of its owner.
