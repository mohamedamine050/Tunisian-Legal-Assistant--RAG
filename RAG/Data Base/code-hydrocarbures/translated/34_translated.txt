## English Translation:

1. **Article 34:** It is prohibited for any licensee partner, except with prior authorization from the granting authority, to transfer, in whole or in part, and in any manner whatsoever, their rights and obligations arising from an exploration license or a research license. The transfer of an exploration license or a research license, in whole or in part, is permissible only to an entity that meets the conditions imposed for granting the license, and after authorization from the Minister in charge of hydrocarbons, based on an approval opinion issued by the Hydrocarbons Advisory Committee. 

2. **Article 34:** If the research license is granted to multiple partners, the withdrawal of one or more partners shall not lead to the cancellation of the license if their rights and obligations are transferred to the remaining partners, provided that the granting authority is notified accordingly. In this case, the withdrawal shall be considered a relinquishment. If the remaining partners exercise this option, the transfer shall include the rights and obligations related to the remaining term.

3. **Article 34:** If the transfer is total or partial, the transferee shall assume all obligations or commitments undertaken by the transferor towards third parties in exchange for receiving goods, services, or loans from them. The transferee shall enjoy all rights related to the whole or the part transferred to them, including obligations and rights arising from the provisions of this Code, the regulations adopted for its implementation, and the specific agreement, starting from the date the transfer comes into effect.

4. **Article 34:** The transfer shall come into effect from the date of signing the transfer documents prepared for this purpose between the transferor and the transferee, subject to obtaining authorization from the granting authority. The transfer shall be formalized by a decision issued by the Minister in charge of hydrocarbons, published in the Official Gazette of the Tunisian Republic.

5. **Article 34:** Any transfer to a company established according to the legislation of any country that does not have diplomatic relations with the Tunisian Republic, or whose registered office is located in one of these countries, is prohibited, even if the transferee is a branch of the transferor.

6. **Article 34:** The methods of submitting and examining the application for a transfer authorization for an exploration license or a research license shall be determined by a decision of the Minister in charge of hydrocarbons.
