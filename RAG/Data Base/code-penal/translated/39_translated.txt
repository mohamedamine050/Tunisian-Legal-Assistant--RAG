There is no crime against one who repels an assailant whose act exposes his life or the life of one of his relatives to imminent danger, and escape was not possible by any other means.  Relatives are:

First: Ascendants and descendants.

Second: Brothers and sisters.  Third: Spouses.  As for if the person exposed to danger is not one of these relatives, the judge shall exercise his discretion in assessing the degree of responsibility.
