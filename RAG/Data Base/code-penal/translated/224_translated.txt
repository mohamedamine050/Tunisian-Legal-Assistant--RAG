(Paragraphs 3 and 4 were added by Law No. 93 of 1995, dated November 9, 1995)

Anyone habitually subjecting a child or other minor under their authority or supervision to ill-treatment shall be punished by imprisonment for five years and a fine of one hundred and twenty dinars.  This is without prejudice to more severe penalties prescribed for assault and battery. Habitual deprivation of food or treatment shall be considered ill-treatment. The punishment shall be doubled if the habitual ill-treatment results in physical injury exceeding twenty percent, or if the act is committed using a weapon. The punishment shall be life imprisonment if the habitual ill-treatment results in death.
