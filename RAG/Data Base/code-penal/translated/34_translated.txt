(Amended by Law No. 23 of 1989 dated February 27, 1989) The death penalty prescribed for the principal perpetrators of a crime is replaced with life imprisonment in respect of their accomplices who concealed the stolen goods resulting from said crime.  A sentence of ten years' imprisonment shall be imposed if the accomplices who concealed the stolen goods are not proven to have known the reasons that led to the sentencing of the principal perpetrators to death.
