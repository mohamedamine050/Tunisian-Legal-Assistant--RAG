(Added by Decree No. 106 of 2011, dated October 22, 2011).  The public official or equivalent who, before the competent authorities became aware of the matter and after receiving an order to torture, or an incitement to commit it, or notification of its occurrence, informs the administrative or judicial authority with guidance or information enabling the discovery of the crime or the prevention of its execution, shall be exempt from the penalties incurred for the acts stipulated in Article 101 bis of this Code. The penalty originally prescribed for the crime shall be reduced by half if the information and guidance led to the prevention of the continuation of torture, or the discovery of the perpetrators or some of them, and their arrest, or the prevention of harm or the death of a person. The life imprisonment penalty prescribed for torture resulting in death, as stipulated in the last paragraph of Article 101, second part, of this Code, shall be replaced with a twenty-year prison sentence.  Notification made after the discovery of the torture or the commencement of investigations shall not be taken into consideration. No claim for damages or criminal prosecution can be brought against anyone who, in good faith, provided the notification.
