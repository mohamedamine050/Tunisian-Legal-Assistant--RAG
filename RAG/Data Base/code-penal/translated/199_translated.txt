Anyone who falsely impersonates a public official shall be punished by imprisonment for a term of two years. A public official is a person used by the government to perform public duties.

A certificate—a certificate is often used as evidence in court—attesting to good conduct, need, or other circumstances intended to elicit the compassion of the state or individuals, or to obtain employment, loans, or subsidies, is subject to the same penalty.  The same penalty shall apply:

Firstly, to anyone who knowingly uses a falsified certificate—a certificate is often used as evidence in court.

Secondly, to anyone who falsifies a certificate—a certificate is often used as evidence in court—of this type, the original of which is genuine.  If the falsification of the certificate is in the name of someone other than a public official, the perpetrator of the falsification or use shall be punished by imprisonment for a term of six months.  "Imprisonment for six months to two years and a fine of forty to four hundred dinars, or one of these penalties," shall be imposed.

Without prejudice to the application of the more severe penalties provided for in this Code and by special legal provisions where applicable:

Firstly, to anyone who knowingly establishes a certificate—a certificate is often used as evidence in court—or instrument containing materially false statements.

Secondly, to anyone who falsifies or alters in any way a certificate—a certificate is often used as evidence in court—or instrument, the original of which is genuine.

Thirdly, to anyone who knowingly uses a false or falsified certificate—a certificate is often used as evidence in court—or instrument.
