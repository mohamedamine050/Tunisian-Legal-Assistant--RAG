(Added by Law No. 89 of 1999 dated August 2, 1999 and amended by Decree No. 106 of 2011 dated October 22, 2011).  Torture means any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for the purpose of obtaining from him or a third person information or a confession, regarding an act which he or the third person has committed or is suspected of having committed.  The intimidation or harassment of a person or a third person to obtain the aforementioned also constitutes torture.  Pain, suffering, intimidation, or coercion inflicted for any reason based on racial discrimination falls within the scope of torture. A public official or a person acting in a similar capacity who orders, instigates, consents to, or remains silent about torture during the performance of his duties or on the occasion of their performance shall be considered a torturer.  Pain resulting from, consequent to, or inherent in legal penalties shall not be considered torture.
