(Amended by the order dated September 15, 1923),

Whoever intentionally impersonates another person in circumstances that led, or could have led, to the recording of a court judgment imposing penalties on the judicial record of that other person, shall be punished by imprisonment for five years, in addition to any other proceedings that may be undertaken as appropriate for forgery.  The same penalty provided for in the preceding paragraph shall apply to anyone who intentionally makes false statements regarding the civil status of an accused person in the recording of a court judgment imposing penalties on a judicial record pertaining to a person other than that accused. Imprisonment for three years shall be imposed on:

First: Anyone who forges a passport for foreign travel, or a travel permit within Tunisian territory, or a judicial record extract, or a firearms license, or any other license or administrative certificate.

Second: Anyone who fraudulently alters any of those documents that are originally genuine.

Third: Anyone who uses those forged or altered documents.
