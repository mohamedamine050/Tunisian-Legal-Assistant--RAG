Enclosed areas, pens, or fenced places are considered any land surrounded by a ditch, fences, a woven mat of reeds or other materials, planks, or boundaries made of living or dead plants, or a wall regardless of its construction materials, height, depth, or state of age or disrepair, even if it does not have doors that close with locks or otherwise, or if the doors have gaps or are habitually open.  Pens or enclosures not permanently fixed, intended for keeping animals on land, regardless of how they are constructed, are also considered fences.
