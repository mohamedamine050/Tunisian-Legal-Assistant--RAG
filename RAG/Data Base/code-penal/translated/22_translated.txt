Residence prohibition is a prohibition imposed upon the convicted person; a defendant against whom a judgment has been rendered.  A judgment is a written decision of the court that resolves a legal issue or fact, determining the defendant's responsibility for a crime and imposing a penalty or precautionary measure.  The prohibition prevents the convicted person from residing and appearing in places or areas specified in the judgment. The judgment is issued in the forms prescribed by law and its duration shall not exceed twenty years.
