If a prisoner escapes, the official charged with his custody or apprehension shall be punished, in case of negligence, with imprisonment for two years, and in case of complicity, with imprisonment for ten years. The punishment of the negligent official shall cease if the escaped prisoner is apprehended or brought in within a period of four months, unless his arrest is due to other crimes.
