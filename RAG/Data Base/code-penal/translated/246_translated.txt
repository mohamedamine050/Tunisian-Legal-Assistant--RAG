Slander occurs:

Firstly: If it is judicially proven that what constituted the slander is an allegation or attribution of a matter to the public that harms the honor or reputation of a person or official body, and which is not substantiated.

Secondly: If the slanderer cannot prove the slander; slander occurs with any allegation or attribution of a matter to the public that harms the honor or reputation of a person or official body when the law permits it.  Slander is punishable even if committed in writing that has not been published to the public, but has been viewed by two or more persons, or has been sent to them.
