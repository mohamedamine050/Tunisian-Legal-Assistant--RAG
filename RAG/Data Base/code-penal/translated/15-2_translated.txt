- That the offender be present at the hearing.
- That he be subjected to a medical examination in accordance with the provisions of Article 18 of the Penal Code.
- That there be no evidence presented to the court, through the circumstances of the act for which prosecution occurred, that such a penalty would not serve to maintain the offender's social integration.  The court shall inform the offender of his right to refuse the substitution of imprisonment with community service or electronic monitoring and shall record his answer. In case of refusal, the court shall impose the other penalties provided for. A judgment ordering the substitution of imprisonment with electronic monitoring shall be immediately forwarded to the probation officer responsible for the convicted person's place of residence.


Judgment: A ruling by a court that declares a person responsible for a crime and imposes a sentence or preventive measure.

or to the court of first instance within whose jurisdiction the judgment was rendered if the convicted person does not have a place of residence in Tunisia, which shall take the necessary steps to initiate the implementation of the electronic monitoring sentence.

In case of impossibility, the convicted person shall remain

Judgment: A ruling by a court that declares a person responsible for a crime and imposes a sentence or preventive measure.

in the situation he was in when presented to the court until the necessary steps to initiate the implementation of the electronic monitoring sentence are taken by the competent probation officer. The court shall determine the period within which community service must be completed, not exceeding eighteen months from the date of the judgment.  Imprisonment cannot be substituted with electronic monitoring unless the offender has undergone a medical examination and a certificate confirms the applicability of this measure.  Community service or electronic monitoring cannot be combined with a custodial sentence.


Article 15, Fourth paragraph (Added by Law No. 68 of 2009 dated August 12, 2009). The objective of the alternative compensatory penalty is to substitute the custodial sentence with a financial compensation that the convicted person

Judgment: A ruling by a court that declares a person responsible for a crime and imposes a sentence or preventive measure.

must pay to the person who suffered direct personal harm from the crime.  The amount of compensation may not be less than twenty dinars (20) or exceed five thousand dinars (5000), even if there are multiple victims. The alternative compensatory penalty does not affect the right to civil compensation, and the court shall take into account the amount of the alternative compensatory penalty when assessing civil compensation. If the court sentences to a custodial sentence in misdemeanors or to a sentence not exceeding six months in felonies, it may substitute the custodial sentence with an alternative compensatory penalty if the circumstances of the act for which prosecution occurred so warrant. For the alternative compensatory penalty to be declared, the judgment must be rendered in the presence of the accused, and the accused must not have previously been sentenced to imprisonment or an alternative compensatory penalty. The alternative compensatory penalty shall be enforced within a period not exceeding three months from the expiry of the time limit for appealing the initial judgment or from the date the judgment becomes final. The substitution of imprisonment with an alternative compensatory penalty is prohibited for the crimes stipulated in Articles 85, 87, 87 bis, 90, 91, 101, 103, 104, 125, 126, first paragraph, 127, 128, 143, 206, 209, 212, 214, 215, first paragraph, 219, first paragraph, 224, first paragraph, 227 bis, second paragraph, 228 bis, 238, 240 bis, 241, 243, 244, and 284 of the Penal Code, and Articles 89 and 90 of the Highway Code, and Articles 411 and 411 ter of the Commercial Code.
