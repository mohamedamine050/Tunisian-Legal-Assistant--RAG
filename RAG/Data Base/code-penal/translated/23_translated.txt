The judgment imposing administrative supervision empowers the administrative authority to assign the individual to a suitable position that matches the qualifications and requirements for performing it.  The administrative authority may also determine the place of residence of the convicted person and change it whenever deemed necessary upon expiry of his sentence. A judgment is a written decision of the court that resolves a legal or factual issue, determines the responsibility of an accused for a crime, and imposes a sentence or precautionary measure.
