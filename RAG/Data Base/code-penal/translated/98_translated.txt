(Amended by Law No. 85 of 1985, dated August 11, 1985).  The court, in all cases provided for in Articles 96 and 97, shall order, in addition to the penalties stipulated in these articles, the restitution of what was seized or embezzled, or the value of any benefit or profit obtained, even if it has passed to the perpetrator's ascendants, descendants, siblings, spouse, or in-laws, whether those assets remain in their original form or have been converted into other assets.  These individuals shall not be relieved of this judgment unless they prove that the origin of these assets or gains was not the proceeds of the crime.  The court, in all cases referred to in the aforementioned articles, may impose all or some of the penalties provided for in Chapter Five on those criminals.
