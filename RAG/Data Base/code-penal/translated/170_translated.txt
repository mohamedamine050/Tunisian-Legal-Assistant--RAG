Whoever transports, secretly conceals, hides, or destroys a corpse with the intent of concealing the death of its owner shall be punished by imprisonment for six months and a fine of seventy-two dinars.  The prison sentence shall be increased to two years if the corpse is that of a murdered person; however, this shall not preclude the application of the rules of complicity where applicable.
