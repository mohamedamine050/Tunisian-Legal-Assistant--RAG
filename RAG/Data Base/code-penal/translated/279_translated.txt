The debtor, borrower, or third party pledging the mortgage, who with malice aforethought embezzles or destroys a mortgaged item belonging to them, shall be punished by the penalties stipulated in the second paragraph of Article 278 of this Code.  The attempt is also punishable.  An official mortgage is a contract by which the creditor acquires, on property allocated to the satisfaction of his debt, a real right; this right enables him to take precedence over ordinary creditors and subsequent creditors in the order of priority in recovering his right from the proceeds of that property, whomever may possess it.
