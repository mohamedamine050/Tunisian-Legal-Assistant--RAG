Whoever assaults a public official, as defined in Article 319 of this Code, with slight blows, shall be punished by imprisonment for one year and a fine of seventy-two dinars.

A public official is a person employed by the government to perform public duties.

The same shall apply if the assault occurs while the official is performing his duties or on the occasion of performing them.  The punishment shall be imprisonment for five years and a fine of two hundred and forty dinars if the violence is of the type stipulated in Article 218 of this Code, and in this case, if there is prior intent to commit violence, or if the blows cause wounds or illness, or if the assault is committed against a judicial official, the punishment shall be imprisonment for ten years and a fine of four hundred and eighty dinars. This shall not preclude the application of the penalties stipulated in Article 219 of this Code, where applicable.
