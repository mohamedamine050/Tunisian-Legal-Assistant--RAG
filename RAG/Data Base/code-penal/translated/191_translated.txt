Articles 185 to 190 of this Code shall not apply to one who returns to circulation pieces of counterfeit, altered, or coloured currency which he received believing them to be genuine. However, he shall be punished by a fine equal to six times the value of the pieces which he returned to circulation, if he uses those pieces after having himself, or by means of another, verified their defects.
