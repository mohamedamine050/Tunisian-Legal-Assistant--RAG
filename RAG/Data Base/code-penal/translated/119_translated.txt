Any person participating in a rebellion, whether armed or unarmed, who during its course assaults a public official in the performance of his duties, shall be punished, for his participation alone, with imprisonment for five years if the rebellion involved fewer than ten individuals, and with imprisonment for ten years if it involved more than ten individuals. This shall not preclude the penalties provided for in this law for the perpetrator of the assault and battery.  The penalty for those participating in the rebellion shall be imprisonment for twelve years if the assault results in the death of the public official; this shall not preclude the application of the penalties prescribed for those committing homicide.  (Amended by Law No. 23 of 1989 dated February 27, 1989).
