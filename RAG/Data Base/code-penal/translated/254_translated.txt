(Amended by the order dated April 25, 1940)

Physicians, surgeons, and other health professionals, pharmacists, midwives, and others entrusted with secrets due to their status or profession, who divulge these secrets except in the instances where the law requires them to report or authorizes them to do so, shall be punished by imprisonment for six months and a fine of one hundred and twenty dinars. However, without the aforementioned individuals being obligated to report cases of illegal abortion that they become aware of in the course of their duties, they shall not be subject to the penalties stipulated in the preceding paragraph when reporting such cases.  They may give their testimony if summoned before the courts in a case concerning abortion, without being subject to any penalty.
