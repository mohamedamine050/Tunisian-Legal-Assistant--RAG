(Amended by the order dated July 9, 1942).  Imprisonment for a term of three months to one year and a fine of twenty dinars to two hundred and forty dinars, or one of these penalties only, shall be imposed upon anyone who informs the public authorities of an offence which he knows with certainty did not occur, or who fabricates false evidence relating to a fictitious crime. The same penalties shall be imposed upon any person who declares before a judicial authority that he is the perpetrator of a crime which he did not in fact commit, nor participate in committing.
