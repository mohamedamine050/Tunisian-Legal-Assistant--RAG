(Amended by Law No. 24 of 1965 dated July 1, 1965 and by Decree No. 2 of 1973 dated September 26, 1973, ratified by Law No. 53 of 1973 dated November 19, 1973).  Anyone who undertakes or attempts to procure the miscarriage of a visible or potential pregnancy by means of food, drinks, medicine, or any other method, whether with or without the consent of the pregnant woman, shall be punished by five years’ imprisonment and a fine of ten thousand dinars, or by one of these penalties.  The woman who procures or attempts to procure her own miscarriage, or consents to the use of, or is subjected to, any means to that end, shall be punished by two years’ imprisonment and a fine of two thousand dinars, or by one of these penalties.  The termination of pregnancy is permitted during the first three months by a physician legally practicing his profession in a hospital, health institution, or licensed clinic.  It is also permitted after three months if the continuation of the pregnancy is likely to cause a collapse of the mother’s health or her nervous balance, or if the fetus is expected to suffer from a serious illness or defect; in this case, it must be performed in a licensed institution.  The termination of pregnancy referred to in the preceding paragraph must be performed after the physician undertaking it obtains a report from the physician providing treatment.
