Imprisonment for a period of six months and a fine of seven hundred and twenty dinars shall be imposed upon anyone who fraudulently induces a buyer to accept something other than the specific thing identified which he purchased. The same punishment shall be incurred by anyone who fraudulently, by using tricks, misrepresents to the buyer the nature, quantity, or quality of the thing delivered.  All of this does not preclude, as the case may require, application of the specific provisions concerning fraud if the goods are adulterated or unfit for consumption.
