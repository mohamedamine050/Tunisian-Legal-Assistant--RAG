(Amended by Law No. 63 of 1966, dated July 5, 1966).  Special confiscation is the seizure for the State Treasury of the proceeds of the crime or the instruments used or capable of being used in the commission of the crime.  The judge, in the event of a conviction, may order the seizure of objects used or intended for the commission of the crime, as well as the proceeds of the crime, regardless of their owner. In all cases, the judge shall order the seizure of objects whose manufacture, use, possession, or sale is prohibited, such that their commission constitutes a crime.
