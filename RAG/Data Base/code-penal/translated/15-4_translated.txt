(Added by Law No. 68 of 2009, dated August 12, 2009)

The purpose of the pecuniary penalty is to substitute a custodial sentence with a financial compensation payable by the convicted person who has been found responsible for a crime and sentenced to a penalty or precautionary measure. This compensation is payable to any person who suffered direct personal harm as a result of the crime.  The amount of compensation cannot be less than twenty dinars (20) nor exceed five thousand dinars (5000), even if there are multiple victims. The pecuniary penalty does not preclude the right to civil compensation, and the competent court must take the amount of the pecuniary penalty into account when assessing civil compensation.  The court may, if it has imposed a custodial sentence that is immediately enforceable in misdemeanors or a custodial sentence not exceeding six months for felonies, substitute the custodial sentence with the pecuniary penalty in the same judgment, if the circumstances of the act warrant such a substitution.  For the pecuniary penalty to be declared, the judgment must be rendered in the presence of the accused, and the accused must not have previously been sentenced to imprisonment or to a pecuniary penalty. The pecuniary penalty shall be enforced within a period not exceeding three months from the expiry of the appeal period for the initial judgment or from the date the judgment becomes final. The substitution of imprisonment with a pecuniary penalty is prohibited for the crimes stipulated in Articles 85, 87, 87 bis, 90, 91, 101, 103, 104, 125, 126 (first paragraph), 127, 128, 143, 206, 209, 212, 214, 215 (first paragraph), 219 (first paragraph), 224 (first paragraph), 227 bis (second paragraph), 228 bis, 238, 240 bis, 241, 243, 244, and 284 of the Penal Code and Articles 89 and 90 of the Roads Code and Articles 411 and 411 ter of the Commercial Code.
