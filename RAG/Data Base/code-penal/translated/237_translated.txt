(Amended by Law No. 93 of 1995, dated November 9, 1995)

Whoever abducts or attempts to abduct a person, or compels, diverts, transports, or attempts to compel, divert, or transport him from the place where he was, using trickery, violence, or threats, shall be punished by imprisonment for ten years.  The punishment shall be increased to twenty years if the abducted person or the person whose destination was diverted is a public official, a member of the diplomatic or consular corps, a member of their family, or a child under the age of eighteen. This punishment, a sanction and remedy imposed in the name of society upon a person criminally liable for a crime committed based on a court judgment, shall apply regardless of the status of the person, if his abduction or diversion of destination occurred with the aim of extorting a ransom or executing an order or condition. The punishment shall be life imprisonment if the abduction or diversion of destination was carried out using a weapon, or by means of a false uniform or identity, or by a forged order issued by a public authority, and also if such acts resulted in physical injury or illness. The punishment for these crimes shall be the death penalty if accompanied or followed by death.
