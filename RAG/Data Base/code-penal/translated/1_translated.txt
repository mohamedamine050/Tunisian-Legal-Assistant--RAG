No one shall be punished except by virtue of a provision of the law.  The law is a rule agreed upon by a competent authority that regulates the conduct of citizens and institutions.  If the law is enacted prior to the act, but if the law is enacted after the act has occurred and before the final judgment, and its text was appended to the accused, then the judgment shall be rendered in accordance with it and no other.
