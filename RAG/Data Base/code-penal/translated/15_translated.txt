The execution of the prison sentence begins from the date of the convicted person's apprehension.  The convicted person is a defendant against whom a judgment, a written decision from the court resolving a legal issue or fact, determined responsibility for a crime and imposed a penalty or precautionary measure. By virtue of a judgment, a written decision from the court resolving a legal issue or fact, the judgment is final. However, if he was previously detained or preventively arrested, the entire period served shall be deducted from the sentence imposed, unless the judgment specifies that it shall not be deducted, either wholly or partially.
