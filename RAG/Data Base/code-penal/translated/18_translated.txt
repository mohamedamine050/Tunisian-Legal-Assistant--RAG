(Repealed by Law No. 23 of 1968, dated July 24, 1968, then added by Law No. 89 of 1999, dated August 2, 1999)

The convicted person—a defendant against whom a judgment has been rendered establishing their responsibility for a crime and imposing a penalty or preventive measure—shall benefit from work for the public interest pursuant to the laws and regulations concerning the preservation of health and occupational safety.  Health is a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being. The convicted person—a defendant against whom a judgment has been rendered establishing their responsibility for a crime and imposing a penalty or preventive measure—shall benefit from the penalty of work for the public interest under the same legal regime for compensation for damages resulting from work accidents and occupational diseases applicable to prisoners who perform work requested of them or related thereto. (The second paragraph was amended by Law No. 68 of 2009, dated August 12, 2009).
