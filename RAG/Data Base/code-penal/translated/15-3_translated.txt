Thirdly (added by Law No. 89 of 1999 dated August 2, 1999, and repealed and replaced by Article 4 of Government Decree No. 29 of 2020 dated June 10, 2020). The following conditions are required for the substitution of a prison sentence with a sentence of community service or electronic monitoring:

- That the interested party be present at the hearing.
- That he be subjected to a medical examination in accordance with the provisions of Article 18 of the Penal Code.
- That there be no evidence presented to the court, through the circumstances of the act for which prosecution occurred, that this sentence is unsuitable for maintaining the defendant's social integration.

The court shall inform the defendant of his right to refuse the substitution of the prison sentence with a sentence of community service or electronic monitoring, and shall record his response. In the event of refusal, the court shall impose the other applicable penalties.  A judgment ordering the substitution of a prison sentence with electronic monitoring shall be immediately forwarded to the judge responsible for the enforcement of penalties in the jurisdiction of the convicted person's residence.

A judgment which has established the responsibility of the accused for a crime and imposed a penalty or preventive measure; or a judgment of the primary court within whose jurisdiction the judgment was rendered if the convicted person does not have a residence in Tunisia, shall initiate the necessary procedures for the commencement of the execution of the electronic monitoring penalty. If this proves impossible, the convicted person shall remain in his current situation upon presentation to the court until the necessary procedures are taken for the commencement of the execution of the electronic monitoring penalty by the competent judge for the enforcement of penalties.  The court shall set the time limit for the completion of community service, which shall not exceed eighteen months from the date of the judgment.  A prison sentence may not be substituted with electronic monitoring unless the defendant has undergone a medical examination and a result confirming the applicability of this measure has been received.  A sentence of community service or electronic monitoring may not be combined with a prison sentence.
