Any attempt to commit a crime shall be punished with the punishment prescribed for the crime itself if its frustration or the absence of intent was caused by matters outside the perpetrator's will. However, an attempt shall not result in punishment in all instances where the crime does not warrant imprisonment for more than five years, unless the law provides otherwise.
