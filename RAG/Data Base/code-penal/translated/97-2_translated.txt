(Added by Law No. 33 of 1998 dated May 23, 1998). Any public official who, whether in active service, on leave, or attached, participates personally or through an intermediary, by work or capital, in the operation of a private entity subject to his oversight by virtue of his duties, or with whom he was tasked with concluding contracts, or in whose contract conclusion he was an active element, shall be punished by imprisonment for three years and a fine of three thousand dinars.  The punishment shall be reduced to two yearsâ€™ imprisonment and the fine to two thousand dinars for the public official who exploited his former position and engaged in such participation before the expiration of five years from his definitive cessation of duties, in order to obtain a benefit for himself or another, or to cause harm to the administration.
