Any person who, with the intent to be relieved of any public service or to exempt another from such service, or with the intent to obtain allowances or other benefits, forges a medical certificate or surgical certificate, shall be punished by imprisonment for a period of three years.  A person's sworn statement is often used as evidence in court.
