(Amended by Law No. 73 of 1958 dated July 4, 1958)

Whoever falsely accuses, by any means whatsoever, a person or several persons before an administrative or judicial authority which considers such accusation or refers it to the competent authority, or before the landlords or tenants of the accused, shall be punished by imprisonment from two to five years and a fine of seven hundred and twenty dinars.  The court may, in addition, order the publication of the full judgment or a summary thereof in one or more newspapers at the expense of the convicted person. If the acts subject to the accusation are liable to criminal or disciplinary punishment, proceedings may be initiated under this section either after a first instance or appeal court judgment dismissing the case, or after a decision to shelve the case issued by investigating courts, or after the shelving of the accusation by the judge, official, or authority concerned, or the tenant who determined the outcome of the accusation. The court seized under this section shall adjourn consideration if the proceedings relating to the subject of the accusation are still pending.
