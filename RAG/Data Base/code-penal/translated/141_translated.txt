(Amended by the order dated February 18, 1927),

The court, in all cases provided for in Articles 139 and 140 of this Code, may deprive offenders of their political and civil rights as defined in Article 5 of this Code.  Furthermore, it shall order the publication of the entire judgment or a summary thereof in newspapers designated by the court and its posting in places specified by the court, especially on the doors of the convicted person's residence, warehouse, factory, or workshop, at the convicted person's expense and within the maximum limit of the fine imposed; however, this shall not prevent the application of the provisions of Article 53 of this Code. The court shall specify the size and type of lettering to be used for printing and the duration of the posting. In the event of the removal, concealment, or total or partial tearing of the postings ordered by the court, the provisions of the judgment regarding posting shall be re-executed. The penalty shall be imprisonment from one to six months and a fine from twenty-four dinars to four hundred and eighty dinars if the convicted person intentionally removed, concealed, or tore the posting, totally or partially, or if this was done at his behest or on his orders. In all cases provided for in Articles 139 and 140 of this Code, the court may not undertake consideration of the case except pursuant to a referral from the investigating judge, within the meaning of the fourth paragraph of Article 106 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. If the investigating judge deems it necessary during the investigation to appoint an expert, this expert shall be added to the expert chosen by the accused, if the accused so requests. If a disagreement arises between the experts, the investigating judge shall appoint a third expert.  The referral decision shall in all cases be reasoned.
