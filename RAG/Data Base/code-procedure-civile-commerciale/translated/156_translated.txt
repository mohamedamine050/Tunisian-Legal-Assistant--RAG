A final judgment may be appealed by means of a petition for review in the following instances:

First: If the opposing party committed a fraud that influenced the judgment and the party against whom the judgment was issued was unaware of the fraud at the time the case was presented. 

Second: If it is proven that the documents or other data upon which the judgment was based were forged, by admission of the opposing party or by a judgment, and this forgery was the sole or primary cause of the judgment, provided that this proof is established after the judgment and before the petition for review is filed.

Third: If the appellant, after the judgment, obtains conclusive evidence in the lawsuit that was previously withheld by the opposing party, on the condition that the date of obtaining this evidence is established.
