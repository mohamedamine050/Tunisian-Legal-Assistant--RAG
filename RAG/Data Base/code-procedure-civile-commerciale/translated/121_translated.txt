(Amended by Law No. 87 of 1986 dated September 1, 1986).- Deliberations shall be secret, without any written record being made, and only the judges who have heard the pleadings shall participate. When a majority is reached, a **pleading** shall be drawn up. 

The **pleading** shall be signed by the deliberating judges and shall not become final until it is pronounced in an open hearing attended by all the judges who signed it. If one of the judges is prevented by a legitimate reason from attending the hearing for the pronouncement of the judgment after the completion of the deliberations and signing of the **pleading**, the judgment shall be pronounced in the presence of the remaining judges. If the absent judge does not sign the **pleading** or if the reason for his absence relates to the loss of his status, the case shall be re-argued.
