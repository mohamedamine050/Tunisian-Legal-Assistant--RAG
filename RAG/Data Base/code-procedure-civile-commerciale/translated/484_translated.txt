In the event of the aforementioned termination, if the buyer undertakes purging procedures to definitively release the property from the registrations related to debts before the arrangement is settled, he must secure the purchase price, which is the amount agreed upon by the contracting parties, whether it exceeds or falls short of the value of the sale, in the Deposit and Trust Fund. He must also notify the registered creditors and the seller before the **Court of First Instance** at the location of the property to declare the validity of the insurance. If the Court finds the insurance valid, it will authorize the deletion of all registrations related to the debts, while maintaining their effect in relation to the purchase price. The **Director of Real Estate** will then proceed with the authorized deletion upon being presented with a copy of the judgment and a certificate confirming that it is not subject to appeal. The costs incurred for verifying the insurance, in the event of the judgment confirming its validity, will be shared at the same rank as the costs incurred for requesting the arrangement.
