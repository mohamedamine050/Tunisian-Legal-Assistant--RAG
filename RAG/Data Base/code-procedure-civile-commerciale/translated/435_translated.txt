If the debtor provides evidence that the income generated by his real estate properties for a period of one year, net and free of all expenses, is sufficient to cover the principal and accrued interest of the debt, and that he has appointed a reasonable creditor to collect it, the court may authorize the suspension of proceedings. However, this suspension may be appealed if it prevents the satisfaction of the debt.
