The purchase price of the property shall be paid within one month following the sale to the lawyer responsible for the proceedings. However, if the property is registered and there is a registered creditor or multiple registered creditors, the purchase price shall be secured in the Deposit and Consignment Fund within the two months following the sale. If it is established that the purchaser is the sole creditor and is the registered mortgagee of the property or holds a first-rank registration, then they are only required to secure the portion of the purchase price exceeding the amount of their debt secured by the registration within the time period specified in the preceding paragraph. In the case of the first paragraph above, the purchaser shall pay, concurrently with the purchase price, the assessed expenses and fees. In the cases of the second and third paragraphs, the purchaser shall secure these expenses and fees unless they have previously been paid by them as the person responsible for the proceedings.
