(Amended by Law No. 87 of 1986, dated September 1, 1986). - The Court, if it deems it necessary to conduct certain investigations, may order the hearing of evidence or the conduct of directions and tests, or the pursuit of the lawsuit, if it considers that a forgery or other acts revealing the truth warrant such action. The Court may, by order in the presence of the parties, determine the date, time, and location of the investigations it has authorized, which may be at the office of the assigned judge, at the site of the dispute, or at any other place.
