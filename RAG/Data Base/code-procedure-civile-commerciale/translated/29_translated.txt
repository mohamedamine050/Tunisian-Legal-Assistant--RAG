(Amended by Law No. 87 of 1986 dated September 1, 1986).- If an opposition claim is filed before the Court of First Instance and its amount exceeds the jurisdictional limit of the Court, the Court shall declare its lack of jurisdiction to hear both claims. However, this shall not apply if the opposition claim relates to damages arising from the original claim.  If it appears to the Court that the party filing the opposition claim has deliberately inflated the amount in order to remove the case from its jurisdiction, the Court shall reduce the amount to its true value and decide on jurisdiction based on the actual value of the subject matter of the claim.
