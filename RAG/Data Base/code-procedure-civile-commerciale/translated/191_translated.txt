(Amended by Law No. 87 of 1986 dated September 1, 1986). - The decision issued by the **Court of Cassation**, a court of civil jurisdiction within the judicial authority, which must be independent within the three branches of government, is the highest court in the judicial hierarchy. This is justified by the principle of cassation (overturning) to oversee the proper application of laws by the courts of first instance.

In case of cassation, the parties are returned to the situation they were in before the overturned judgment, specifically with respect to the issues on which the cassation was based. If the cassation is with referral to another court, and that court rules in a manner contrary to the original decision, and the judgment is challenged on the same grounds as the initial cassation, the **Court of Cassation**, composed of its chambers assembled, shall review the legal issue that was found to be in violation by the referring chamber. If it finds cassation, it shall rule on the merits of the case if it is ready for decision. If it finds that the case should be returned, its decision shall be binding on the referring court.
