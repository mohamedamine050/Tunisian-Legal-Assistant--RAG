(Amended by Law No. 87 of 1986 dated September 1, 1986). - Counterclaims provided for in Articles 433 to 436 shall be filed within a period commencing from the date of deposit of the specifications with the Court Registry and ending ten days before the hearing date. The claimant shall summon the defendant to appear at a hearing held at least five days before the hearing date, with the summons notice being served at least three days prior, failing which the right to file the counterclaim shall be forfeited. The judgment shall be rendered in principle before the hearing date, but the Court may authorize the postponement of the hearing if it deems it necessary to consider the counterclaim. In this case, judgment shall be rendered against the party filing the counterclaim, who shall be deemed to have lost his case, with costs incurred due to the appeal proceedings, irrespective of the award of damages.
