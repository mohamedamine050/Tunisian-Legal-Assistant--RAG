##  The Lawsuit

**The Lawsuit**

[1] A lawsuit is a request by one party from another for their right to be recognized in the presence of a judge. The requesting party is called the plaintiff and the party from whom the request is made is called the defendant.  [2] The lawsuit is the right of any claimant to bring their claim before the courts in order to obtain a judgment in their favor. For the defendant, it is the right to present reasons for defense or arguments to refute that claim.

A lawsuit involving multiple parties, either plaintiffs or defendants, with differing interests, is to be considered in terms of the judgment concerning each individual's interest, not collectively.
