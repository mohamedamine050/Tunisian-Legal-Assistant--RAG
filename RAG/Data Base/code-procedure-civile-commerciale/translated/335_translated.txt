**(Amended by Law No. 82 of 2002, dated August 3, 2002).**- The prudent creditor must notify the prudent debtor of the distraint within five days of its execution by a writ issued by one of the executing bailiffs, containing a summons to appear before the competent court within a period of not less than eight days and not exceeding twenty-one days to hear judgment on the validity of the distraint proceedings, failing which the distraint shall be void. The case shall be registered compulsorily with the secretariat of the competent court within a period of not exceeding forty-eight hours from the date of the summons to the debtor. If the distraint is executed by order of the judge, the summons to the debtor shall also be directed to hear judgment against him for payment of the creditor's debt. In this case, judgment shall be rendered in a single ruling on both the request for payment and the validity of the distraint proceedings. If the distraint is executed pursuant to a judgment that is not enforceable, the consideration of the request to correct the distraint shall be postponed until the judgment referred to becomes enforceable.
