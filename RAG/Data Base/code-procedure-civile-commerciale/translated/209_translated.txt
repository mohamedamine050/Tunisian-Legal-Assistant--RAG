**(Amended by Law No. 14 of 1980 dated April 3, 1980).**

**Appeal**

Appeal is a legal procedure that allows a chosen party to request a review of a judgment rendered by the lower court.

**Provisional Orders**

Provisional orders are not subject to suspension of execution. However, exceptionally, the President of the Court hearing the appeal may authorize the suspension of the execution of the appealed judgment for a period of one month when it appears to him that there is a clear violation of the provisions of Article 201 of this Code. The authorization to suspend execution may only be issued after hearing the parties. Decisions issued authorizing the suspension of execution are not subject to any form of appeal, even by cassation.
