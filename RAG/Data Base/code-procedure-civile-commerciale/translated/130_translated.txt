**(Amended by Law No. 87 of 1986, dated September 1, 1986).** An appeal is filed by a written petition drafted by a lawyer on behalf of the appellant to the competent Court of Appeal. The appeal petition must include the necessary information required in a petition initiating a lawsuit, such as: 

[1] A request by one party to another for the recognition of a right, in the presence of a judge. The party making the request is called the plaintiff, and the party against whom the request is made is called the defendant. 
[2] A lawsuit is the right of any claimant to submit their claim to the court for a judgment in their favor. It also represents the right of the opposing party to present their defenses or arguments aimed at refuting the claim.

The appeal petition should also include the statement of the appealed judgment, its number, and date. The lawyer's address is considered the designated address for the appellant.
