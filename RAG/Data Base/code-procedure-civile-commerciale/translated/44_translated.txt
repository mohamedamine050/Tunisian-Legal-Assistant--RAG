(Amended by Law No. 59 of 1994 dated May 23, 1994). - When the judge receives a lawsuit 
[1] A party requests his right from another in the presence of the judge; the requester is called the plaintiff and the one requested from is called the defendant. [2] The lawsuit is the right that belongs to every claimant to present it to the judiciary for judgment in its subject matter. It is, in relation to the opponent, the right to present reasons for defense or arguments aimed at refuting that claim.

The clerk shall authorize the summoning of the parties to reconcile, and if reconciliation is impossible, to adjudicate. The summons shall be made by one of the court officers or administrative authority to appear before him on the date he sets for that purpose. The judge may, if he deems it in the interest of justice, authorize, upon request from the claimant or without such request, the summoning of the defendant by registered letter with acknowledgement of receipt and notification of delivery or by a bailiff.
