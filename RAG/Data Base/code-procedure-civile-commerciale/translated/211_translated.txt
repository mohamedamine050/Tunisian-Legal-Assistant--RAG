(Amended by Law No. 82 of 2002 dated August 3, 2002). - Anyone encountering a difficulty during execution must present their argument to the executing judge, orally or in writing. The executing judge shall prepare a record of this argument and continue with the execution, unless the matter is deemed complex. In such a case, the executing judge shall suspend execution, prepare a record detailing the difficulty, and include a summons for all concerned parties to appear at the next available session before the competent judge. A copy of this record shall be served on each party.

Execution may only be suspended if the person raising the difficulty has paid the costs of publishing the case to the executing judge. The latter shall then present the matter to the aforementioned judge, providing him with a copy of the record. If the executing judge refuses to present the difficulty to the court, the person raising the difficulty may appeal the matter to the competent judge after securing a sum of fifty dinars at the Financial Registry, under the specific heading of a fine imposed on them in case their claim is rejected. They must then summon the executing judge and all parties concerned to appear at the next available session before the competent judge. In this case, the executing judge must submit their observations on the raised difficulty. 

The judge shall consider the difficulty after hearing the executing judge and the parties, or their legal representatives. If the person raising the difficulty fails to appear, the judge shall rule on the matter as if they were present. The decision issued by the judge in all cases shall be immediately enforceable on the draft, irrespective of any appeal and without requiring notice. The court clerk must provide a copy of the text of this decision to any party requesting it, free of charge, within twenty-four hours of its pronouncement.
