In the event of summoning the parties in writing, the designated period for appearance shall not be less than three days between the day of service of the summons and the designated day for appearance. Failure to comply with this period shall render the summons null and void. However, if there is a compelling need to consider the case urgently and the aforementioned period is not suitable, the judge may authorize the summons for a hearing before him from one hour to another and shall specify this in the summons.
