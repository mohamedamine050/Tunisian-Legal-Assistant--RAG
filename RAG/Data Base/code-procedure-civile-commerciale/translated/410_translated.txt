The provisions of this chapter apply to the *'aqala* [attachment] which empowers a creditor holding an enforceable instrument to place the movable property in the possession of his debtor under the authority of the court, and to sell real property rights that may be mortgaged or portions, whether separate or shared, of the same rights.
