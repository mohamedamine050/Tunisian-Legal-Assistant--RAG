(Amended by Law No. 82 of 2002 dated August 3, 2002). - An action is brought by a plaintiff against a defendant before a judge. The action is the right of any party to bring their claim before the court for a judgment in their favor. For the defendant, the action is the right to present reasons for defense or arguments intended to refute that claim.

The action is initiated by the plaintiff, or their representative, by filing a written petition with the court. This petition shall include the name, title, profession, and address of both the plaintiff and defendant. If applicable, it shall include the registration number and location of the defendant’s commercial registry entry, as well as the name, title, profession, and address of their representative, if any. If the plaintiff or defendant is a legal entity, the petition shall include the name, registered office, legal form (if a company), registration number, and location of the commercial registry entry. 

The petition shall also include the subject matter of the action and the plaintiff’s requests. The court clerk shall register the petition on the day it is received in the designated register and then submit it to the judge.
