The court that issued the judgment is solely responsible for interpreting its own judgment upon a written request from the parties submitted to the court president. The court shall interpret the judgment in the deliberation chamber, without any arguments from the lawyers regarding the arguments presented during the defense of their position. The interpretation shall not add to or detract from the meaning of the judgment. This interpretive judgment shall be supplementary to the judgment being interpreted and shall not be subject to any form of appeal except together with the judgment being interpreted.
