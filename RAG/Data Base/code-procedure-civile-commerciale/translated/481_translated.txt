The sale of real estate by public auction through the court or in accordance with the procedures provided for in Article 450 shall legally purge such real estate of all privileges and mortgages attached to it and, in general, of all registrations relating to debts. At that point, creditors shall only have the right to claim against the sale price. The Director of Real Estate shall, upon registration of the sale deed, proceed to delete, on his own initiative, the registrations referred to above, once he is provided with proof of the securing of the sale price, expenses, and fees provided for in Article 429, after deducting any amounts that the purchaser may be legally entitled to recover or receive from the sale price.
