Each chamber consists of a Court of Cassation, a court of justice where disputes between parties are litigated. This court is civil and falls under the judicial authority, which must have its independence within the three branches of government. The Court of Cassation is considered the highest court in the judicial hierarchy, justifying this by the principle of appeal for the purpose of supervising the proper application of laws by the original courts. It is composed of a President and two Counselors, assisted by a Clerk, with the presence of a representative of the Public Prosecutor in the session being mandatory. The Chief President may delegate the chairmanship of the session to the senior Counselor of the chamber if necessary. No one who has previously participated in the judgment of the case may participate in the issuance of the decision.
