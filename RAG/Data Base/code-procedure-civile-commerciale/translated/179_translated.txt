The judgment is not subject to any form of appeal before the **Court of Cassation**, which is a civil court that is part of the judicial authority, which must be independent within the three branches of government. 

The **Court of Cassation** is considered the highest court in the judicial hierarchy. This is justified by the principle of cassation, which aims to monitor the proper application of the law by the original courts. 

However, only a party to the contested judgment or their successors may appeal. The appeal is only admissible if it relates to a reason specific to the party. However, one of the defendants may base their appeal on a reason that applies to some of them if the right in question is indivisible.
