The **Court of Cassation** is a court of law where disputes between parties are adjudicated. It is a civil court that falls under the judicial authority, which must be independent within the three branches of government. 

The **Court of Cassation** is considered the highest court in the judicial hierarchy. This is justified by the principle of cassation, which aims to oversee the proper application of laws by courts of first instance.  

The Court of Cassation considers requests for adjustment between courts in the following cases: 

First: If multiple courts of the same level have ruled on the same case within their respective jurisdictions, and these rulings have the force of res judicata. 

Second: If several courts of the same level have ruled that a case does not fall within their jurisdiction, and these rulings have the force of res judicata. 

Requests for adjustment are reviewed according to the procedures outlined in the cassation chapter.
