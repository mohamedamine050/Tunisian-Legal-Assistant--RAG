(Amended by Law No. 40 of 1963 dated November 14, 1963). - The bringing of a possessory action does not preclude the bringing of a claim for ownership based on disturbance or dispossession of prior possessors from bringing a claim for ownership.  The claim for ownership brought against the defendant in a possessory action, prior to the defendant being served with the possessory action, has no effect on the possessory action.  And the defendant against whom a possessory action has been brought cannot bring a claim for ownership until the possessory action has been decided. If a judgment is issued against the defendant in the aforementioned action, the defendant cannot bring a claim for ownership until the defendant complies with the judgment.
