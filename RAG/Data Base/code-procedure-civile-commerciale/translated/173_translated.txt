The objection results in the case being re-submitted.  The judgment accepting the objection does not affect the rights of anyone other than the objector. 

An objection is a procedure that takes place during the trial session, where the defense, or a party to the lawsuit, often the defendant, attempts to protest. 

The objector does not benefit from the judgment issued against him, unless the subject matter of the dispute is indivisible.
