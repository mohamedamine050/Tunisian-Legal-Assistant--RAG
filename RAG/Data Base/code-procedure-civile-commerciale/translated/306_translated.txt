A creditor holding a mortgage or a specific privilege is not entitled to request the sale of other assets of his debtor when the assets specifically allocated to secure his debt are sufficient to cover it. Neither can he object to the attachment of movable or immovable assets allocated to secure his debt or their forced sale at the request of another creditor. However, he is entitled to object to the proceeds of the sale and assert his right of priority in the distribution of the proceeds. The agreement reached by the contracting parties shall not exceed or fall short of the value of the object sold. 

However, a creditor holding a mortgage or a specific privilege is entitled to object to the attachment of movable assets in the possession of his debtor, under the authority of a writ of execution held by another creditor, and the subsequent forced sale of these assets by the other creditor, when the value of the assets specifically allocated to secure his debt is insufficient to cover it.
