If a precautionary attachment has been previously executed, authorizing the creditor holding an enforceable instrument to place the movable property in the possession of his debtor under the authority of the court, the executing judge shall transfer it to an executory attachment upon the expiry of the period stipulated in Article 287. For this purpose, he shall compare the movable property with what is recorded in the minutes of the precautionary attachment and issue a report in this regard. However, he may execute an executory attachment on other objects not covered by the precautionary attachment.
