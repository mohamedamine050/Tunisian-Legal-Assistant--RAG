Primary Courts shall authorize the provisional execution of their judgments, with or without a guarantor and without regard for appeal, if there exists an official document bearing the character of a governmental act in accordance with the established procedures, or a handwritten document whose signature is not disputed, or a confession, or a recognized promise, or a prior judgment that has become res judicata and that is connected to the present case.
