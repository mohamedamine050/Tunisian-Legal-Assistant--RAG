**(Amended by Law No. 87 of 1986 dated September 1, 1986)** - The Court of Cassation is the highest court in the judicial hierarchy, justifying its position by the principle of cassation to oversee the proper application of laws by the courts of first instance. It is a civilian court, subject to the judicial authority, which must be independent within the three branches of government. The Court of Cassation is a place where litigants engage in litigation. Its role is to review appeals regarding the subject matter of the appeal, deciding whether to accept or reject them. If accepted, the Court of Cassation decides to annul or quash the judgment, in whole or in part, and directs the case back to the court of first instance for reconsideration of the matters subject to cassation. If the appeal is made for the second time on grounds different from the original reason for cassation, and the Court of Cassation finds grounds to overturn the judgment appealed, it may adjudicate the matter if it is ready for a decision.
