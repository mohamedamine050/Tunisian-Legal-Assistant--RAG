(Amended by Law No. 87 of 1986 dated September 1, 1986). - The Court Clerk shall not accept an appeal petition unless the appellant provides him with a receipt from the Registrar certifying that he has secured thirty dinars as a security for the fine that shall be imposed on him if he does not win his case, as well as all fees that the law requires to be secured. The State and the poor assisted by legal aid are exempt from this security. If the appeal is reversed in the Court of Cassation, the Court may exempt the appellant from the fine and return it to him.
