Within forty-eight hours from the date of the decision, the clerk of the Court of First Instance, which is a civil court subject to the judicial authority that must have its independence within the three branches of government, shall notify the debtor, either directly or through his/her deputy responsible for paying wages or salaries at the place where the debtor works, of the issuance of this reasoned decision.

These notifications shall include: 1) the decision ordering the preventive attachment and the date of its issuance, 2) the names, titles, professions, and addresses of the attaching creditor, the debtor subject to attachment, and the third party in whose possession the debtor's assets are held, 3) the assessment of the debt by the judge of the Court of First Instance.
