The President of the Court of First Instance, or his delegate, shall consider all difficulties related to the enforcement of judgments issued:

Firstly, from the Court of First Instance, which is not subject to any form of appeal.

Secondly, from the Court of Appeal, whether the judgment confirms the first instance judgment or overturns it.

The Governor of the Region shall have jurisdiction to consider all difficulties related to the enforcement of all judgments issued by him, even if they are overturned by the Court of Cassation.

A court is an institution where litigation between parties takes place. It is a civil entity subject to the judicial authority, which must be independent within the three branches of government.
