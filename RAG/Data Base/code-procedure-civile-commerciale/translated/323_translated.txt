## English Translation:

A precautionary seizure is a temporary and precautionary measure that safeguards a right from threats and the possibility of its non-recovery. It serves as a preliminary step to the execution of a seizure, which enables the creditor to sell the debtor's assets and recover their debt from the proceeds. This applies to all assets, whether movable or immovable, except for registered real estate and assets whose seizure is prohibited by law.
