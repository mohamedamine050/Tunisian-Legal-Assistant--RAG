(Amended by Law No. 87 of 1986 dated September 1, 1986). - Every creditor with a fixed debt may, with the permission of the judge of the district or the President of the Court of First Instance, within whose jurisdiction the debtor resides, execute a writ of attachment against the movable property in the debtor's possession, to the extent necessary to satisfy the debt, including financial amounts and movable property that the debtor owns or is entitled to, even if such entitlement is subject to a term or condition. Authorization from the judge is not required if the creditor holds a final judgment, even if it is not yet enforceable.
