## English Translation:

**Attachment**

An attachment empowers a creditor holding an enforceable instrument to place the tangible movable property in the possession of his debtor under the authority of the court.

The assignment of funds due to contractors or to those who have completed works of a public nature shall only take effect upon completion of the aforementioned works. This assignment is valid only after deducting all sums that may be due to the workers as their wages for the aforementioned works, or to those who provided materials or other objects used in the construction of the facilities for which payment is sought. The payment of funds due to the workers for their wages takes precedence over the payment of funds due to the suppliers.
