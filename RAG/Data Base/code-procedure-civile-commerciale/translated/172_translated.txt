(Amended by Law No. 14 of 1980 dated 3 April 1980). - The objection suspends the execution of the judgment.

**Objection**
An objection is a procedural step taken during a trial by the defense, or one of the parties to the lawsuit, often the defendant, to protest against the judgment. However, the presiding judge or the reviewing judge may suspend the execution of the contested judgment by an order based on a separate written request from the request for objection, which is examined according to the procedures set forth in the chapter on urgent proceedings. The order suspending execution is not subject to any form of appeal, even to the Court of Cassation.
