Notwithstanding the provisions of the first paragraph of Article 306, the creditor may simultaneously request a _*seizure*_  of two or more immovable properties belonging to his debtor, even if they are located within the jurisdictions of different courts. In this instance, a _*seizure*_  record or a notice shall be drawn up for each property. The sale shall be conducted simultaneously and in accordance with a single procedure. If the properties subject to the _*seizure*_  are located within the jurisdictions of different courts, the decision shall be made before the **Court of First Instance** where the most significant property is located. If the properties belong to a single exploitation, the sale shall be conducted before the **Court of First Instance** where the primary center of the exploitation is located.
