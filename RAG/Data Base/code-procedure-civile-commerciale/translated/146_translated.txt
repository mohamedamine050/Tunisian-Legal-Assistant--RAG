## Appeal

**Appeal** is a legal procedure that allows a party to request a review of the judgment issued by a previous court.  

**Primary judgments** are suspended from execution, except as otherwise provided by law. However, the President of the court may authorize the suspension of the execution of judgments described in error as (1) final.  Authorization to suspend execution shall only be issued after hearing the pleadings in an expedited session held as soon as possible. 

**The applicant** is the person who has initiated the legal proceedings.  The applicant must summon their opponent to this hearing through the bailiff; if they fail to do so, the request will be rejected.  Authorization issued for suspension of execution is not subject to any form of appeal, including by way of cassation.
