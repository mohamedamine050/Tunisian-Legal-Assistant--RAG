If a request for examination of documents is submitted by one of the parties, the court shall consider whether the purpose of such request is to delay the proceedings. In such a case, the court has the authority to reject the request. However, if the court finds that the request is likely to be true and that it cannot reach a decision without such examination, it shall suspend consideration of the original case and authorize the examination to be carried out.
