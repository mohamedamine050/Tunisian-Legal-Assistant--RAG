**(Added by Article 3 of Law No. 82 of 2002 dated August 3, 2002.)**- Following the appraisal, the appraised property shall be sold by public auction, either in bulk or in detail, as deemed in the best interests of the appraised party. The sale shall be advertised upon the expiry of eight days from the date of the executive appraisal or transfer, or the notification of the appraised party thereof, unless the appraiser and the appraised party agree to set another deadline, or if it becomes necessary to shorten the eight-day period to prevent a substantial loss in the sale price or to avoid exorbitant custody expenses. The debtor, the appraised party, may, prior to the date of the decision, bring in anyone he wishes to purchase the appraised property, subject to the agreement of the creditor and the objecting creditors, or if the offered price is sufficient to fully settle the principal debt, interest and expenses.
