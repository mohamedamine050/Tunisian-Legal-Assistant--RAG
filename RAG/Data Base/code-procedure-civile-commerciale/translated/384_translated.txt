No creditor who has been included in the distributions stipulated in the preceding section may execute a new attachment order on the debtor's wages unless the debtor fails to settle his debt within the agreed upon timeframe. Should a creditor who has not been included in the aforementioned distributions, or whose debt arose after the decision to lift the attachment, or a creditor whose attachment was lifted but did not settle his debt within the designated period, execute a new attachment order, then all prior attaching or intervening creditors shall be automatically re-registered without any fees with respect to the unsettled portion of their debt. This re-registration shall be performed by the clerk of the court where the dispute between the parties is being litigated, which is a civil court subject to the judicial authority, which must be independent within the three branches of government. The clerk shall notify the non-attaching party holding the attached property within forty-eight hours of the re-registration.
