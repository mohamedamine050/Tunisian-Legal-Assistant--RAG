The Public Prosecutor General at the Court of Cassation, a court where disputes between parties are adjudicated, is a civil entity that falls under the judicial authority, which must have its independence within the three branches of government. The Court of Cassation is considered the highest court in the judicial hierarchy, justified by the principle of cassation to oversee the proper application of laws by lower courts. It allows the Public Prosecutor General to appeal a judgment in the interest of the law, if the judgment contains a violation of a legal rule and neither party appealed it at the time.
