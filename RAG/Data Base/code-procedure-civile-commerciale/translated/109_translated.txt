The impeachment of an expert has no effect if its grounds arose after his appointment due to an act by the party raising them. However, if the grounds for impeachment were due to conduct that incites or encourages hatred, disgust, contempt, or severe mockery on account of a person's race or religion and arose without his act after the period specified in the preceding article or the party raising them proves that they were unaware of them until after its expiry, then they shall be considered valid.
