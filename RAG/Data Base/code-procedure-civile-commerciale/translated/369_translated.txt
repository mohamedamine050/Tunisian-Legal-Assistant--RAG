Within forty-eight hours of the date of the request or decision, the clerk of the court, the court where litigation takes place between the parties, being a civil court under the judicial authority which must be independent within the three branches of government, shall direct a summons to the person for whom the attachment is sought, to the person in whose hands the attachment is made, and to all other creditors who are rational or intervening, to appear before the district judge at the session that the latter shall set. The time for appearance shall be the same as that provided for in Article 362. The district judge shall consider this matter at this session or at any other session that he shall set initially, if the amount claimed, regardless of its size, warrants it, and shall issue a final ruling on the validity or nullity of the attachment or its lifting, as well as on the declaration that the person in whose hands the attachment is made is required to submit at the same session, unless it was submitted previously to the clerk of the court by registered mail. This declaration must state in a precise and accurate manner the status of the relationship between the person in whose hands the attachment is made and the debtor for whom the attachment is sought.
