Fruits and crops approaching maturity may be pledged before being harvested. 

A report constitutes a form of information transmission, formulated in a semi-final state to reach the recipient. 

The pledge must state the property, its location, the type and importance of the pledged fruits or crops, even if only approximately, otherwise it is void.  Pledged fruits and crops are sold as long as they remain on the market.
