**(Amended by Law No. 87 of 1986 dated September 1, 1986).**  If the lawyer dies or loses his capacity, the case shall be adjourned until the Bar Council appoints a temporary substitute pending the appointment of another lawyer. The lawyer may not abandon the representation at an inappropriate time, and upon abandonment, he must inform his client and provide the court with evidence of such notification. The client must appoint a new lawyer within fifteen days of being notified of the abandonment. If the client fails to do so and is the plaintiff, the case shall be dismissed or the appeal shall be rejected. If the client is the defendant, the court shall continue with the proceedings in the case. The same shall apply if the lawyer is dismissed by his client without compensation.
