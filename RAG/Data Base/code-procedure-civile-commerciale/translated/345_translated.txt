The custodian, upon being notified of the judgment confirming the attachment, shall pay to the creditors who are of sound mind and objecting, the amounts acknowledged by him or for which the Court has ruled that he is indebted on behalf of the person under his custody, up to the amount of their debts. If the custodian does not do so, the aforementioned creditors may request the execution of an attachment.

The attachment empowers the creditor holding an enforceable instrument to place the movable property in the possession of his debtor under the authority of the Court. This applies to the proceeds of the debtor's assets as well. In the cases specified in Articles 334 and 344, the Deposit and Consignment Fund or the trustee, upon being notified of the judgment confirming the attachment, shall pay to the creditors who are of sound mind and objecting, the amount insured, up to the amount of their debts.

If the precautionary attachment involves movable property, the attachment shall be executed on said property. The proceeds from the sale of the property shall be distributed in accordance with the agreed-upon price between the parties, unless the price exceeds or falls short of the value of the property sold.
