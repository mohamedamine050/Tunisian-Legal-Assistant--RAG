The Court of Cassation is a court where disputes between parties are adjudicated. It is a civil court that falls under the judicial authority, which must have its independence within the three branches of government. The Court of Cassation is considered the highest court in the judicial hierarchy. This is justified by the principle of cassation, which aims to oversee the proper application of laws by the courts of origin in all final judgments.
