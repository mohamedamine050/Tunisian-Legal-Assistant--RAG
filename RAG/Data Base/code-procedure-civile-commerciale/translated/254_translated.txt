If the executed copy delivered to the party in whose favor the judgment was issued is lost before execution, he may obtain a second copy by an urgent order from the presiding judge after summoning the parties. It is also necessary, and a condition, that he provide a guarantor. 

A guarantor [1] is one who undertakes the obligation of another while the obligation remains on the latter, or one who joins his own liability to that of another in what the latter is obligated to do, presently or in the future. [2] This refers to a person who provides or issues a surety bond, a guarantee of payment upon demand, a letter of guarantee, or any other form of guarantee: for the purpose of securing the fulfillment of any financial obligation in favor of a creditor. 

Unless the judgment debtor [3] acknowledges that the judgment has not been executed, the guarantor shall not be relieved of his liability unless the period within which the right to execute the judgment lapses, or the judgment is fully or partially executed without opposition from the judgment debtor.
