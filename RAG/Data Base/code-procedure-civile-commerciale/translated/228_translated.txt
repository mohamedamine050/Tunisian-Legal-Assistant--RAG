Judgments in incidental and subsidiary claims, which are intended to oppose the principal claim, are governed by the following:

[1] A person seeking their right from another in the presence of a judge; the claimant is called the plaintiff and the person against whom the claim is brought is called the defendant. 

[2] A claim is the right of anyone with a demand to bring it before the court for a ruling on its subject matter. It is the right of the defendant to present reasons for defense or arguments aimed at refuting that demand.
