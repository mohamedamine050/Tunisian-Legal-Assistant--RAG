Public officials, even if they have completely ceased to be in service, may not, without the consent of those to whom they were subject or are subject, testify in matters which they have come to know in virtue of their functions. Article 100.- Lawyers, doctors and others whose situation requires that they be considered as confidants of others, may not, if they have become aware of a fact or information by virtue of this capacity, testify about it, even after their capacity has ceased, unless they are requested to do so by those to whom they owe this secrecy, and on condition that this is not prohibited to them by the provisions of their specific laws.
