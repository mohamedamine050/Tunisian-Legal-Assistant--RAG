The defendant who seeks to impugn the testimony of a witness on the grounds that such testimony constitutes conduct that incites or incites hatred, disgust, contempt, or severe ridicule due to the person's race or religion, must declare and explain his reasons before the testimony is received. If the impugned conduct is disputed as to its existence, or if it is factual but agreed upon as to its existence, the judge shall not cease to hear the testimony and shall charge the party alleging the impugnment to prove it within a time frame to be set by the judge. The judge shall then leave the matter of assessing the testimony to the court at the time of judgment. However, if the impugned conduct is legally recognized by the witness as existing, then the court shall desist from hearing him as a witness. The judge may, where appropriate, hear the impugned witness for guidance, particularly if the matter concerns family disputes between spouses, which are often only known to close relatives.
