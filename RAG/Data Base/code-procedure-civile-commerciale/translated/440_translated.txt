If the party pursuing the proceedings fails to fulfill any of the obligations or to perform any of the procedural acts within the prescribed deadlines, any creditor holding an enforceable instrument or a formal instrument with the maturity date of his debt having passed may give him notice through one of the executing bailiffs to continue the proceedings within eight days following the notice. If he does not continue the proceedings, the action will be brought against him for substitution and the judgment in this action shall be issued within a month. The party pursuing the proceedings who is ordered to be replaced shall deliver to the substituted party, against receipt, all documents in his possession relating to the proceedings. The substituted party shall continue the proceedings under his own responsibility. Any expenses incurred by the party pursuing the proceedings shall be recovered in accordance with the provisions of Articles 429 and 430. The party who is ordered to be substituted may modify the initial price agreed upon by the contracting parties, provided it is higher or lower than the value of the subject matter of the sale, by simply submitting a declaration to the court registry. This shall be added to the specifications. If the bidding is published or commenced, the initial price agreed upon by the contracting parties, provided it is higher or lower than the value of the subject matter of the sale, can only be modified subject to the publication and announcement of the bid anew in accordance with the forms and deadlines provided for in Articles 418 to 420, specifying the new initial price agreed upon by the contracting parties, provided it is higher or lower than the value of the subject matter of the sale.
