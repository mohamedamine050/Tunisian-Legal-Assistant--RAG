If a preliminary attachment, 
which enables a creditor holding an executory instrument to place the movable property in the possession of his debtor under the authority of the court,
is followed by a real estate attachment, the executing judge shall notify the debtor of the conversion of the aforementioned preliminary attachment into an 
executory attachment upon the expiry of the period stipulated in Article 287. This conversion shall be stated at the bottom of the minutes of the preliminary attachment, specifying its date, as well as the executory instrument by which it was carried out, and the debtor shall be informed of this instrument.
