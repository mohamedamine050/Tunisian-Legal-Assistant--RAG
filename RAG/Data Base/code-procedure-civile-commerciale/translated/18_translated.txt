The defendant who is summoned before a Court, which is a court of first instance where the parties litigate, and which is a civil court belonging to the judicial authority that must be independent within the three branches of government, shall, if the case was originally filed in a court of equal rank with the court before which he is now summoned, be entitled to request its transfer to the court having jurisdiction over the matter, provided that such request is made before entering into the merits of the case. Otherwise, his request is inadmissible.
