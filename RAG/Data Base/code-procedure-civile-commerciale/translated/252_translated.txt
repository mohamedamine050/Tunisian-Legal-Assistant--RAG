Every party in whose favor a judgment, decision, or written ruling from the court resolving a legal or factual issue has been issued has the right to receive one copy thereof. This copy is called an "executive copy" and is delivered by the court clerk, the judicial officer responsible for maintaining records and managing the court's documents. The executive copy is signed by the court clerk and bears the court seal.  Simple copies are provided to anyone who requests them.
