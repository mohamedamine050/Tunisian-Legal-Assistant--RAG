The defendant against whom a precautionary attachment has been ordered may, in all cases, request from the Emergency Judge referred to in Article 330, authorization to secure, either personally or through a representative under his control, at the Deposit and Consignment Fund or with another trustee, a sum of money to be determined by the aforementioned judge, sufficient to cover the amounts for which the precautionary attachment or the objections made pursuant to Article 313 were issued. Upon the securing of this sum, the effect of the precautionary attachment against the representative under his control ceases, and the secured amount is allocated to satisfy the debts of the defendant and the objectors.
