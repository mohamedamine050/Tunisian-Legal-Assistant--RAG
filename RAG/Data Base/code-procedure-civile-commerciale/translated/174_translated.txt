If the objection request is rejected, the objector shall be ordered to pay the security deposit. The security deposit shall be paid regardless of whether the objector is subsequently found liable for damages.  If the objector withdraws the objection, the court may, if it deems it necessary, exempt the objector from paying the security deposit and authorize the return of the deposited funds to the objector.
