If the appealed judgment was issued regarding a procedural objection, and the Court of Appeal finds that the judgment is incorrect, it may limit itself to quashing the judgment and remitting the case to the Court of First Instance for consideration of the merits.  Alternatively, if the matter is capable of being decided, the Court of Appeal may issue a judgment on the merits.
