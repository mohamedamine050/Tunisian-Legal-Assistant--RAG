The company in whose hands the seizure has been executed shall provide the enforcement judge, tasked with selling the shares, portions of shares, and parts of shares subject to the seizure, with the inventory and balance sheet related to its latest balance sheet. These documents can be examined by the enforcement judge before making a decision. In any case, the company may stop the proceedings by paying on behalf of the debtor the amount for which the seizure was executed.
