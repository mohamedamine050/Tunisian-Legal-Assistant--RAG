(Amended by Law No. 87 of 1986 dated September 1, 1986).- The judgment shall be rendered not earlier than forty days and not later than sixty days after the submission of the terms of the deed to the Court.

The President of the Court may set a special session for this purpose. The attorney responsible for the follow-up shall summon the person concerned, and where necessary, the registered creditors and the holders of pending precautionary liens that are still in effect, at their chosen addresses as recorded in their deeds, at least twenty days prior to the sale, to attend the Court on the day appointed for the judgment.
