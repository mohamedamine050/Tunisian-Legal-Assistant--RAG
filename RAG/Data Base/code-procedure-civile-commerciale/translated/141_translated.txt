(Amended by Law No. 87 of 1986 dated September 1, 1986). - The time limit for appeal is twenty days, commencing from the date of receipt of notification of the judgment. The judgment debtor shall be notified, unless the law stipulates a different date or method. When notification takes place, the appeal period shall begin from the date of notification for both the notified party and the person actually receiving the notification. With regard to judgments issued based on fraud by the opposing party, a forged document, or based on false testimony or the suppression of conclusive evidence prevented by the opposing party, the appeal period shall begin from the date on which the judgment debtor becomes aware of the forgery, the appearance of the evidence, or the fraud. Notification must be addressed to each of the parties separately. If the party is absent from Tunisian territory on the day of notification, the appeal period shall be extended by thirty days. If the last day is a public holiday, the period shall be extended to the following day after the end of the holiday.
