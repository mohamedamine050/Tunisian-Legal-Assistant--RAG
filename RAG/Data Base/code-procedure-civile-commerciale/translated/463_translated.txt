If the proceeds from the sale under the attachment or the proceeds recovered from a third party are insufficient to fully satisfy the creditors, they shall agree with the debtor on the completion of the distribution by mutual consent within thirty days from the date of the sale or from the date of notification to the person holding the recovered proceeds, in accordance with the provisions of Articles 345 and 346 of the judgment confirming the provisional attachment.

A written agreement shall be drawn up, a copy of which shall be provided to the person holding the proceeds. The latter shall then pay each creditor the amount due to them under the agreement upon receipt of a signed receipt, and upon the surrender of their debt instrument, if applicable. 

The signatures of the parties at the bottom of the agreement shall be attested, and if any of the parties cannot or do not know how to sign, the agreement shall be drawn up in an official document.
