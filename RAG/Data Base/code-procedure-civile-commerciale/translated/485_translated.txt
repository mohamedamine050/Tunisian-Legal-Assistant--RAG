The President of the **Court of First Instance** shall appoint, at the opening of each judicial year, a qualified individual as the **Administrator** to oversee the arrangement of creditors and the distribution of assets. If the appointed Administrator is unable to fulfill the duties, the President of the **Court of First Instance**, as appropriate, may either replace him or appoint a specific Administrator to settle a particular arrangement.  

**Note:** The Arabic text uses the term "محكمة الابتدائية" twice. I have assumed this is a typo and only used the term once in the translation.
