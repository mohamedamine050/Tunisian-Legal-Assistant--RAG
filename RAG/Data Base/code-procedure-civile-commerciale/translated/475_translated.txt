In the event of the transfer of a registered property and there are registered creditors, each interested party may, after the registration of the transfer in the land registry and the securing of the price agreed upon by the contracting parties, whether it exceeds or falls short of the value of the property, submit a request to the Deposit and Consignment Fund for the ranking of creditors with the aim of distributing the price agreed upon by the contracting parties, whether it exceeds or falls short of the value of the property, amongst them according to the degrees of their debts. This request shall be submitted in the form of a petition to be delivered to the clerk of the **Court of First Instance** at the location of the property by a lawyer whose law office is the chosen address for the applicant. The petition must be accompanied by: 1) a statement of the registrations related to the debts, which is provided by the Real Estate Property Administration and clearly indicates the full titles, names, professions, actual and chosen addresses of the creditors; 2) a certificate of registration of the transfer in the land register; and 3) a certificate from the Deposit and Consignment Fund regarding the amount of the **security**, its reason, date, and number.
