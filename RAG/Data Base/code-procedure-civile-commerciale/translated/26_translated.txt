If the claim,
[1]  involves one party demanding their right from another in the presence of a judge; the party making the demand is called the plaintiff and the party against whom the demand is made is called the defendant. [2]  A claim is the right of anyone with a demand to bring it before the judiciary to obtain a ruling in their favor.  In relation to the defendant, it is the right to present reasons for defense or arguments aimed at refuting the claim.
If the claim encompasses several branches arising from a single cause, then these branches are added to determine the jurisdiction and the level of the judgment. If the branches arise from different causes, then each one is judged independently, in the first instance or definitively, according to its real value.
