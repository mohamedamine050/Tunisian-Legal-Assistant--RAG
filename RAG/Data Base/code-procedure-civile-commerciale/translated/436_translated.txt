In the case of collective seizure as stipulated in Article 424, the person subject to seizure may request the court to postpone the sale of one or more properties included in the seizure. This request does not preclude the registration of the seizure notice in the land registry. However, the request shall only be granted if the debtor proves that the value of the proceeds to be pursued is sufficient to cover the seizure expenses and all registered creditors. The judgment shall specify the properties excluded from the pursuit. Following a final decision, the seizing party may resume the pursuit of the temporarily excluded proceeds if the proceeds of the seized properties are insufficient to cover his expenses. A request to lift the pursuit shall not be permitted if the proceeds are related to the same exploitation.
