(Amended by Law No. 82 of 2002 dated August 3, 2002).- Execution shall take place upon the death of the judgment debtor, after informing his heir of the judgment and the expiry of the period provided for in Article 287, even if such information and period had been previously granted to the judgment debtor himself. If the heir cannot be found despite inquiries by the applicant for execution, and no one can provide proof of the death of the deceased, then after the passage of thirty days from the knowledge of the death, all proceedings relating to the execution shall be delivered to the heir of the deceased judgment debtor without stating his name, at the last known address of the deceased. This notification shall be sufficient for proceeding with the execution. The execution lawfully initiated against the judgment debtor shall continue, where necessary, against his heir without the need to inform him of the judgment again or to grant him a new period.
