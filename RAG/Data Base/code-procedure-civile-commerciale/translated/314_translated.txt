The objection referred to in the preceding paragraph entitles the creditor raising it to the right to participate in the distribution of the price agreed upon by the contracting parties, provided that it exceeds or falls short of the value of the sale, or from the funds reasonably secured by the caveat. The caveat cannot be annulled or lifted, in whole or in part, nor can permission be granted to annul or lift it, in whole or in part, except with the consent of the objecting creditors or pursuant to a written decision of the court that permits their opposition.
