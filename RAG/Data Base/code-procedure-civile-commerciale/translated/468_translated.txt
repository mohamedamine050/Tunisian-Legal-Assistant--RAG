Every creditor who wishes to participate in the distribution of funds must submit to the court's registry the evidence of his debt within thirty days following publication in the Official Gazette, or by registered mail with acknowledgment of receipt, otherwise he will forfeit his right to participate. He must also, when submitting such evidence, file a claim for priority through a lawyer whose law office is the chosen domicile of the creditor. The claim for priority must state the reasons why the debt is preferable to others, when appropriate.  Notifications, publications, and summonses provided for in the preceding two articles must include the provisions of this article, otherwise they shall be null and void.
