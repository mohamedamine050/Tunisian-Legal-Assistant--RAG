Except for money, which must be delivered to the bailiff, the objects in question may be kept in the possession of the debtor if the creditor agrees, or if the other available methods would result in expenses disproportionate to the value of the objects in question. Alternatively, they may be entrusted to a custodian appointed by the bailiff immediately, if the parties do not agree. 

The custodianship cannot be entrusted to the debtor, his spouse, relatives to the sixth degree, in-laws to the fourth degree, or any person in his service, unless the creditor agrees. The custodian is prohibited from using, lending, or benefiting from the objects in question, otherwise, compensation will be granted immediately upon a petition filed by the interested party, regardless of any damages claimed.
