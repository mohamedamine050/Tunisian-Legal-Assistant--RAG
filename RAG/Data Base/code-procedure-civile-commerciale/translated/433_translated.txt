The date of the judgment may be changed only for a serious and justified reason, and then only by a reasoned judgment. If any delay occurs, the judgment issued shall specify a new date for the judgment, which cannot be later than sixty days after the original date of judgment. The postponed judgment shall be announced at least fifteen days before its issuance by means of the publicity methods provided for in Articles 418 to 420.
