If the debtor fails to provide his statement in the manner and within the time limits prescribed by law, or if he provides a false statement, or conceals the documents he is required to present in support of his statement, he shall be deemed to be liable, no more and no less, to the rational creditors or objectors, and judgment shall be rendered against him to pay them their debts, regardless of the damages.

**Damages**

[1] Injury caused by a violation of the law, affecting a personâ€™s body, mental or psychological health, honor, property, or reputation. 
[2] Loss or damage caused to property, deprivation of comfort, harm to physical well-being, reputation, or the like. - In crimes and quasi-crimes, damage refers to the actual loss suffered by the plaintiff, and the necessary expenses that he was or will be forced to incur to repair the consequences of the act committed to his detriment, as well as the benefits he was deprived of within the normal scope of the consequences of this act.
