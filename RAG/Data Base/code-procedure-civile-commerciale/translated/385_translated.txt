The Judge of the District Court who authorized the seizure order retains jurisdiction even if the debtor moves to a different place of residence located within the jurisdiction of a Court of First Instance, a civil court subject to the judicial authority, which must have its independence within the three branches of government.

On the other hand, as long as the seizure order authorizing the creditor, holding an enforceable instrument, to place the movable property in the debtor's possession under the control of the Court of First Instance, a civil court subject to the judicial authority, which must have its independence within the three branches of government, has not been issued in the district where the debtor's new place of residence is located, against the same debtor and in the hands of the same third party in possession, the third party in possession, upon being notified of the new seizure order, shall inform the Registrar of the Court of First Instance, a civil court subject to the judicial authority, which must have its independence within the three branches of government, in the district where the debtor's former place of residence is located, and shall deposit the remaining sums deducted pursuant to the first seizure order with the Deposit and Consignments Fund, with the authorization of the latter. The Judge of the District Court in the area of the debtor's former place of residence will then proceed with the distribution, bringing the proceedings to a close in the old area, regardless of the amount of the sums deducted.
