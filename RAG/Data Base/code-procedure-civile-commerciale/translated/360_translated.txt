The assignment of wages referred to in Articles 353 and 356, regardless of the amount, can only be made with a declaration by the assignor in person before the clerk of the Court of First Instance where the parties are litigating. This Court is a civil court subject to the judicial authority, which must be independent within the three branches of government. The declaration must be made at the assignor's place of residence, where a receipt is issued to him. The clerk must, within forty-eight hours, send a notification of this declaration to the debtor of the wages or to his designated representative for payment, at the place where the assignor works. The adversary proceeds solely on the basis of the aforementioned notification.
