Upon reviewing the results of the search, the Court shall rule either to accept the summons or reject it. In the event that the party being sought is not present during the search, the Court may consider the summons as acknowledged. If there are multiple signatories on the summons and some of them are present only to acknowledge their signature, the judgment issued shall apply to all of them.
