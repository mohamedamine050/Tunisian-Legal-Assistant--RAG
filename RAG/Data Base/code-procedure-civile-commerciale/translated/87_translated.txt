The assigned judge shall prepare the case for judgment by:

- Receiving reports and supporting documents from the lawyers, and requiring them to provide any clarifications or additional documents deemed necessary.
- Conducting any necessary research for the case's progress, hearing both parties personally, recording their points of disagreement, hearing evidence, and receiving their supporting arguments, including the administration of an oath.
- Administering the decisive oath, which one party may request of the other to resolve the dispute between them if the party lacks the legal evidence to prove their claim, relying on the conscience, integrity, and faith of the other party.
- Completing the requests for inspection, authorizing examinations, and making decisions regarding formal aspects that do not affect the subject matter of the claim.
- Documenting every procedural step undertaken, including the date, and finally preparing a report outlining the facts of the case and the actions taken without expressing an opinion on the merits of the case.
