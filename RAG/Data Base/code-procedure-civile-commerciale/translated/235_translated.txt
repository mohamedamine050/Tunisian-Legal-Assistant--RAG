If the Court finds that the action, being a legal proceeding initiated by the plaintiff against another party, which may be an individual or a private entity, wherein the plaintiff claims a right or compensation for a loss caused by the alleged forgery, is unfounded or futile in the context of the case, it shall dismiss it. However, if the Court finds merit in the challenge to the documents, it shall authorize the proof of forgery. If the Court authorizes the investigation of the alleged forgery, the execution of the documents in question shall be suspended.
