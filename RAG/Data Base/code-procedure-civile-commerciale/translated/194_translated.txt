(Amended by Law No. 87 of 1986 dated September 1, 1986).- The filing of a cassation appeal shall not suspend the execution of the judgment appealed against unless it was issued with a forged document or an erasure of its traces, or it was issued with a divorce or the annulment of a contract of marriage, or it was issued against the State for the payment of money or for the lifting of an attachment.

An attachment is the legal process by which a creditor with an enforceable instrument can place the tangible movable property in the possession of his debtor in the hands of the court for the State to collect its funds. Exceptionally, the First President of the Court of Cassation, if requested by the appellant, may authorize the suspension of the execution of the judgment appealed against for a period of one month if he considers that the execution may make it impossible to restore the situation to what it was before its execution. The applicant for the suspension of execution shall provide security for the judgment as a guarantee of execution if it is a financial amount and shall bear the costs of the security.

By security, the insurer undertakes to pay the insured or the beneficiary a sum of money, a fixed income or any other financial compensation in the event of the occurrence of the insured event, in return for premiums or any other financial payment made by the insured to the insurer.

Irrespective of the damages that may be awarded against him in the event of the rejection of the cassation appeal.
