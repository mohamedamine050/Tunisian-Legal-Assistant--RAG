Every judge who is aware of a reason for recusal between him and one of the parties must declare it, and the court will consider whether it is necessary for that judge to recuse himself from the case. Recusal, however, is not accepted if it is based on conduct that incites or encourages hatred, disgust, contempt, or severe ridicule on the grounds of a person's race or religion. 

The judge shall not be recused by a party who, knowing the reason for recusal, proceeds with the litigation or files a pleading without invoking recusal.
