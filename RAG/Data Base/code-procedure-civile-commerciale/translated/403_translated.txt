If a third party claims ownership of the property, in whole or in part, the executing judge, after carrying out the seizure, shall summon both parties to appear before the judge of urgent matters at the place of seizure, in accordance with the provisions of Articles 210 and 211. If this judge finds that the claim of ownership is serious, he shall order the suspension of enforcement proceedings and grant the claimant of ownership a period of fifteen days to bring the matter before the court of first instance. If the claim of ownership is brought within this period, the proceedings shall be obligatorily suspended until the claim is definitively ruled upon. If the claimant of ownership does not provide evidence of bringing his claim within the aforementioned period, the proceedings shall be resumed from the point at which they were initially terminated, without any further action or judgment. The claim of ownership shall be invalid if it is not brought against the party carrying out the proceedings and the property in question, and if it does not include a statement of the grounds for ownership.
