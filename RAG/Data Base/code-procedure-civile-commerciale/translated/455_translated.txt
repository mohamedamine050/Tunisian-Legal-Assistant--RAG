(Amended by Law No. 32 of 2001, dated 2001).

In the event of a prior registered notice, the Real Estate Registry Department shall register, upon submission, any subsequent notice with a statement of the name, surname, address, and the name of the lawyer of the new pursuer.

Furthermore, the margin or bottom of the submitted notice shall state each of the previously registered or mentioned notices, with the details referred to in the preceding paragraph and the designation of the court handling the pursuit proceedings.

The encumbrance cannot be discharged except with the consent of the creditors pursuing the proceedings, as mentioned in the real estate registration, or by a written decision from the Court of Appeal resolving a legal or factual matter, which can be challenged by them.
