(Amended by Law No. 87 of 1986 dated September 1, 1986).- The statement of claim shall be void: 

Firstly: If it contains an error or omission in stating the name and surname of the defendant, the person against whom the claim is directed, or the person claiming, or the court, or the date of the hearing, or if the deadlines for attendance are not observed.

Secondly: If the defendant, the person against whom the claim is directed, or the person claiming, was not notified as provided for in paragraph two of Article 70 or was not served with a copy of the supporting documents of the claim.

The voidability shall be cured by the presence of the defendant, the person against whom the claim is directed, or the person claiming, or their lawyer if the defect is of the type mentioned in the first paragraph, and by the filing of a defense to the claim if the defect is of the type mentioned in the second paragraph.

The court shall rule on its own motion on the voidability of the statement of claim if its voidability is established when the defendant, the person against whom the claim is directed, or the person claiming, or their lawyer, as the case may be, fails to appear or to file a defense.
