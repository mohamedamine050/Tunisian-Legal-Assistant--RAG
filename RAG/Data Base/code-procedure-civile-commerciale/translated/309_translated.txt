Each writ of execution, which empowers the creditor holding an enforceable instrument to place the movable property in the possession of his debtor under the authority of the court, aims to place the assets subject to it under the authority of the court and prevent the debtor from disposing of them to the detriment of his creditors. Therefore, any subsequent transfer, with or without consideration, or lease of the property subject to the writ of execution, as well as any creation of mortgage rights or other proprietary rights thereon, is null and void and has no effect against the creditors.
