The minutes of the execution warrant or the conversion of the precautionary warrant must state the following, otherwise it shall be invalid: 1) The enforceable instrument upon which the warrant or conversion was carried out and the notification of the subject thereof with this instrument; 2) The amount of the debt required to be paid; 3) The presence or absence of the subject of the warrant, and where applicable, the person entrusted with custody during the warrant or conversion proceedings; 4) The date, time, and place of the sale of the warranted items. Furthermore, the minutes shall bear the signature or thumbprint of the person entrusted with custody, whether it be the subject of the warrant or another person. 

The precautionary warrant is a provisional, precautionary measure that preserves the right from threat and the possibility of not being able to recover it, paving the way for the exercise of the execution warrant, which enables the creditor to sell the debtor's assets and recover their debt from the proceeds.

The execution warrant, which empowers the creditor holding an enforceable instrument to place tangible movable property in the possession of their debtor under the jurisdiction of the court, shall be converted into an execution warrant.
