The garnishment order imposed on the wages referred to in Articles 353 and 356, regardless of its amount, cannot be executed, even if the creditor holds a writ, before attempting conciliation before the District Judge at the debtor's place of residence. For this purpose, and at the request of the creditor, the District Judge shall summon the debtor to appear before him by the clerk, with a notice period of at least three days. The creditor shall be verbally informed, upon submitting his request, of the place, date, and time of the conciliation attempt. If notification of the summons is not received, and the debtor does not appear, the creditor, if he does not possess an enforceable writ, must notify the debtor again through an executing bailiff within the time period specified in the second paragraph of this Article, for the purpose of attempting conciliation.
