The execution of an _aql_ (seizure of movable property) by a creditor holding an executory instrument, placing the debtor's movable property in the hands of justice, is not permissible unless based on an executory instrument and for a debt that is certain, definite in amount, and due, taking into account the provisions governing registered real estate.
