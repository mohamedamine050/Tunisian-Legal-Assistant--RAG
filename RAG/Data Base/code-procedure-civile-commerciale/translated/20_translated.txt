Personal actions are described as those based on a personal obligation arising from law, contract, quasi-contract, misdemeanor or quasi-misdemeanor. Actions concerning movable property are described as those aimed at obtaining something that is movable by nature or considered movable by law. Real actions are described as those based on a real right in immovable property. As for actions based simultaneously on a real right in immovable property and a personal right, they are considered mixed actions and are referred to the jurisdiction of personal actions if the real right in immovable property is not disputed.
