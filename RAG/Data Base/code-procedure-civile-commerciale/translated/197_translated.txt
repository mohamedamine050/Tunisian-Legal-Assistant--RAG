The procedural rules set forth in this Law shall apply to cases before the Court of Cassation, a civil court of law that is part of the judicial authority which must be independent within the three branches of government. The Court of Cassation, the highest court in the judicial hierarchy, justifies its role in the principle of review to oversee the proper application of laws by the courts of first instance, insofar as this does not conflict with the provisions of this chapter and as long as it does not contradict the nature of its review.
