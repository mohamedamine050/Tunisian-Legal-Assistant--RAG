The Director of Real Estate shall, of his own motion, when registering the demolition report, register a mortgage on the property in favor of the person for whom the demolition was carried out, or the seller of the transaction, or anyone who has derived a right from them, as a guarantee for the payment of the demolition price and, if necessary, the assessed expenses and fees, unless proof of payment or provision of security for such payment is provided to him. He shall, of his own motion, strike out the mortgage upon receipt of proof of such payment or security provision.

The official mortgage is a contract by which the creditor acquires a real right on a property specifically designated to satisfy his debt. By virtue of this right, he is entitled to priority over ordinary creditors and subsequent creditors in rank in satisfying his claim from the proceeds of that property, in whosever hands it may be.
