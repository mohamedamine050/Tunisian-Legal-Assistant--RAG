The request, signed by the applicant or their legal representative, is presented to the presiding judge who then refers it to the Chief Justice of the Court. Upon receipt, the Chief Justice shall inquire with the judge subject to impeachment and, as necessary, the party accused of impeachment. The Chief Justice shall prepare a report and submit it, along with all collected documents, to the Court composed of judges excluding the judge subject to impeachment. 

If the judge subject to impeachment is the Chief Justice, the aforementioned procedures shall be carried out by the senior judge of the Court.

If the judge subject to impeachment is a district judge, the request for impeachment shall be submitted to the President of the **Court of First Instance**. 

**Court of First Instance** is typically the first court to hear and decide a dispute.

In all cases, the judge subject to impeachment is required to cease proceedings regarding the matter. The party found guilty of impeachment shall be sentenced to a fine ranging from ten to twenty dinars, regardless of any compensation for **damages** that the judge may impose.

The aforementioned judgment is **not subject to any form of appeal**.
