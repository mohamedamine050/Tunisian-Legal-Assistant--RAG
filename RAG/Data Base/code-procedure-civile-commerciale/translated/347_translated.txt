If there are multiple creditors with valid claims or objections, and the reasonable amount is insufficient to satisfy all their claims, the provisions of Articles 463 and subsequent shall apply. However, the provisional seizures or objections made after a final and executory judgment issued by the Court regarding the validity of the attachment, which enables the creditor holding an executory instrument to place the debtor's movable property in the custody of the court, shall only affect the portion of the reasonable amount exceeding the debts of the prior creditors with valid claims or objections.
