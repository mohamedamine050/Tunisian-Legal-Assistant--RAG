If the defendant, against whom a judgment, a written decision of the court resolving a legal or factual issue, has been issued, determining their responsibility for a crime, and imposing a penalty or a precautionary measure, refrains from executing an obligation to perform an act, or if it becomes impossible for them to do so, or if they violate an obligation to refrain from an act, then the executing judge shall record this in a report and refer the matter to the investigating officer to take any steps permitted by law before the same court.
