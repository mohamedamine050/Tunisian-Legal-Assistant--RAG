What the law considers as real estate subject to a lien can only be understood in relation to the principal asset of which it is a part. However, it is permissible to proceed with a lien, which empowers the creditor holding an enforceable instrument to place the tangible movables in the possession of the debtor under the authority of the court and sell them, similar to the sale of movables in cases of debts owed to manufacturers, sellers, or lenders who have provided funds for the purchase, manufacture, or repair of such movables.
