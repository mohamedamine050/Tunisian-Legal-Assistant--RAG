The appeal by way of cassation, or appeal in cassation, is a remedy allowing a party to appeal a court decision considered contrary to the law or when the procedure is not respected. This appeal is available for final judgments in the following cases:

Firstly: If the judgment is based on: 

* **Felonies**, as defined by this penal code, which are crimes punishable by death or imprisonment exceeding five years.
* **Misdemeanors**, which are crimes punishable by imprisonment exceeding fifteen days but not exceeding five years, or by a fine exceeding sixty dinars.
* **Offenses**, which are crimes punishable by a maximum of fifteen days imprisonment or a fine of sixty dinars. (Article 122 of the Code of Criminal Procedure)

Secondly: If the judgment is issued beyond the jurisdiction of the court that issued it.

Thirdly: If there is an abuse of power.

Fourthly: If the procedures or the judgment do not comply with the formal requirements prescribed by law, resulting in nullity or extinction.

Fifthly: If there are contradictory final judgments in their content, issued between the same parties, on the same subject matter and cause.

Sixthly: If the judgment is issued beyond the scope of the parties' requests, or exceeds their requests, or if the Court of Appeal overlooks certain requests which were decided upon at first instance, or if the text of the judgment contains contradictory parts.

Seventhly: If the judgment is issued against a person lacking legal capacity, without their proper representation in the case, or if there was a clear deficiency in their defense, and this was the original or sole cause of the contested judgment.
