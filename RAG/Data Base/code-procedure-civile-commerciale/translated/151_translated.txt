(Amended by Law No. 87 of 1986 dated September 1, 1986). - The appellant against whom a judgment is rendered shall be subject to a fine of ten dinars if the judgment appealed from was issued by a judge of the First Instance Court, and twenty dinars if the judgment was issued by any other court, regardless of the damages incurred by the opposing party due to the appellant's excessive use of the right to appeal. If the appeal is dismissed, the court may exempt the appellant from the fine.
