The District Governor, with the assistance of the clerk, shall distribute the deducted amounts. The Governor shall postpone summoning the concerned parties unless there are serious reasons, such as the reasonable discontinuation of the debtor's services, especially as long as the amount to be distributed, after deducting the necessary expenses and privileged debts, does not reach at least thirty-five percent of the total.
