(Amended by Law No. 82 of 2002 dated August 3, 2002) - The copy is delivered to the person himself wherever he may be found, or at his original residence, or at his chosen address, as the case may be. If the executing officer does not find the person to be notified at his address, he must deliver a copy of the notification to his agent, or to someone in his service or residing with him, provided that the person is capable of understanding and is identified by his identity document. If the person found refuses to receive the copy, it shall be deposited in a sealed envelope containing only the name and surname of the person to be notified and his address, with the clerk of the Court of First Instance or with the clerk of the Court of Appeal. If the executing officer does not find anyone at the address to whom he may leave a copy of the notification, he shall deposit another copy in a sealed envelope containing only the name and surname of the person to be notified and his address, with the clerk of the Court of First Instance or with the clerk of the Court of Appeal. In the latter two cases, the executing officer must send a registered letter with acknowledgement of receipt to the person to be notified within twenty-four hours, addressed to his original residence or his chosen address, informing him of the delivery of the copy as stated. No need for the notification card in urgent matters, as well as when it is impossible to provide it.
