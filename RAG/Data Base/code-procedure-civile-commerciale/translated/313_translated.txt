Creditors authorized to enforce their claims by coercive means are not entitled, with regard to the debtor's assets that have already been subjected to a seizure, to:

* **A seizure warrant** that authorizes the creditor holding an enforceable instrument to place the tangible movable property in the possession of the debtor under the authority of the court for the purpose of execution; or
* **A seizure warrant** that authorizes the creditor holding an enforceable instrument to place the tangible movable property in the possession of the debtor under the authority of the court for the purpose of preservation, except for the right to object to the proceeds of the sale or the funds subject to the preservation seizure, subject to the provisions applicable to registered real estate. 

This objection shall be made by a bailiff who shall draw up a report and notify the debtor whose assets have been seized and the bailiff in charge of the sale if the seized assets are movable property, or the lawyer handling the case if the seized assets are real estate, or the person holding the seized assets if it is a preservation seizure. The report shall state the enforceable instrument pursuant to which the objection was made, the notification of the debtor of this instrument, and the amount of the debt. Furthermore, it shall include the choice of the objecting creditor:

* **To proceed with the seizure,** during a hearing, through an action by the defense, or a party to the lawsuit, often the defendant, to challenge the jurisdiction of the court in relation to the debtor whose assets have been seized; 

Failure to comply with any of these procedures shall result in its annulment.
