The executing judge shall immediately deliver to the person on whose behalf the seizure is sought, and to the custodian when necessary, a copy of the seizure record, even if it is a precautionary seizure, and a copy of the record of the conversion of the precautionary seizure to an execution seizure.

**Precautionary Seizure**

A precautionary seizure is a temporary, preventive measure that safeguards a right from threats and the possibility of not being able to recover it. It is a preparatory step towards the execution seizure, which allows the creditor to sell the debtor's assets and recover their debt from the proceeds.

**Execution Seizure**

An execution seizure is the process by which a creditor with an enforceable instrument may place the tangible movable property in the possession of their debtor under the authority of the court. 

The seizure or conversion shall be effected by a record thereof. If the seizure or conversion is effected without a record, the parties concerned must be notified accordingly.
