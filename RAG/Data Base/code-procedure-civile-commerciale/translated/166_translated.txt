If a decision, a written ruling by the court resolving a legal or factual issue, rejects the appeal, either procedurally or on the merits, the appellant shall be charged a fee equal to the total amount of the security deposit, regardless of any damages arising from this appeal.  If the appellant withdraws the appeal, the court may waive the fee and authorize the return of the security deposit to the appellant.
