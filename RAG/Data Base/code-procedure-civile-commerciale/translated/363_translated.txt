The District Governor, through his Secretary's minutes, shall prepare a concise report in the presence of both parties, whether a reconciliation has been achieved or not, and also in the event that one of the parties is absent.  If the parties reach an agreement, the District Governor shall specify the terms of that agreement. If the parties do not reach an agreement and there is a debt or a dispute regarding the amount of the debt, then the District Governor shall authorize the issuance of a provisional seizure order, specifying the amount to be seized. If the debtor fails to appear after legal summons, the District Governor shall also authorize the issuance of a provisional seizure order in the same manner as described above.
