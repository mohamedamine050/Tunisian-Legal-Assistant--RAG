A judgment of dismissal of the lawsuit before a Court of First Instance, which is a civil court subject to the judicial authority that must have its independence within the three branches of government, results in the annulment of all proceedings, including the lawsuit. The lawsuit is [1] a request by one party for their right from another in the presence of a judge; the requester is called the plaintiff and the party against whom the request is made is called the defendant. [2] The lawsuit is the right of anyone with a claim to bring it before the court for a judgment in their favor. It is the right of the defendant to present defenses or arguments to refute the claim. However, this does not extinguish the right in the original lawsuit. A judgment of dismissal in the Court of Appeal or in a request for review results in the dismissal of the appeal itself.
