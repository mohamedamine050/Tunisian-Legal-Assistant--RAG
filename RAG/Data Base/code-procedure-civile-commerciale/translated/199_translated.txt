The Governor may be held accountable in the manner specified by law. This shall be upon a request signed by the applicant or his representative, submitted through a lawyer to the Chief Justice, in cases of fraud, deception, bribery, or if the Governor is held liable, by law, to pay damages.

Liability refers to the obligation of a person to respond to his actions before the law or to compensate for the damage caused.  The Court of Cassation shall be competent to hear requests to hold Governors accountable, being the highest court in the judicial hierarchy.  This is justified by the principle of annulment to oversee the proper application of laws by the original courts.
