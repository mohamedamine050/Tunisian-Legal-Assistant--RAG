If the judgment orders the delivery of movable property and this property is not found, then the pursuer, if the matter concerns movable property, may request the imposition of an attachment.

Attachment is a legal process that empowers a creditor holding an enforceable instrument to place the movable property in the possession of the debtor under the authority of the court. This is to be executed on the assets of the defendant.

The defendant is the accused who has been convicted by a written decision of the court resolving a legal or factual matter. The decision has determined his responsibility for a crime and has imposed a punishment or a precautionary measure.

This attachment is intended to satisfy the value of the property ordered to be delivered from the proceeds of its sale. If the matter concerns specific property, the pursuer shall claim its value from the competent court.
