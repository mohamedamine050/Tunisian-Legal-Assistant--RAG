(Amended by Law No. 82 of 2002 dated August 3, 2002).- The sale resulting from the first buyer's default shall retroactively rescind the first sale. The defaulter in the sale is obliged to compensate for the difference between the price agreed upon by the parties and the price obtained from the new sale made due to the default. The defaulter is not entitled to claim any potential increase in the price of the new sale. The defaulter in the sale shall not be entitled to recover the advance payment secured until the property is sold again. If there is a shortfall in the sale price compared to the price at which the sale was originally made, the executing judge shall only reimburse the defaulter for the remaining advance payment after deducting the value of the shortfall, the costs of the initial judgment, and adding these to the proceeds of the sale. If the shortfall exceeds the amount of the advance payment, any interested party may take action against the defaulter to oblige him to pay the remaining balance.
