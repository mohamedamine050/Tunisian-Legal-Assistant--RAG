The execution of urgent orders shall take place twenty-four hours after the date of their notification, unless the governor, who is entitled to grant extensions as a matter of discretion, authorizes otherwise. Execution shall be without security unless the governor orders the provision of security. In the case of extreme certainty, the governor may authorize execution according to the draft judgment before registration. The governor may also authorize execution without prior notification.
