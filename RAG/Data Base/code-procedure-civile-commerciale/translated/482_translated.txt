The party who has been granted the right of redemption, as described in paragraph three of Article 432, shall, within fifteen days following the expiration of the period set for the redemption, initiate proceedings to arrange for the creditors, prepaying the expenses required for such proceedings; otherwise, the property shall be resold for the second time due to default. If the amount redeemed by the party granted the right of redemption, pursuant to the provisions of paragraph three of Article 432, is insufficient to satisfy the privileged creditors whose claims rank higher than his, the bailiff or the judgment terminating the arrangement proceedings shall, with regard to the remainder up to the amount of the redemption price, authorize the delivery of executable attachment schedules against the party granted the right of redemption. These schedules shall be endorsed with the executive clause. In the event of non-payment of the amounts specified in the aforementioned attachment schedules, the attaching creditors shall have the option, at their discretion, to either enforce them against the party granted the right of redemption by all legal means or to resell the property due to his default.
