The summons shall include the full name, occupation, and address of the plaintiff, who is the person initiating the legal proceedings, as well as the defendant and the subject matter of the lawsuit.  [1] A lawsuit is a request by a person for their rights from another person in the presence of a judge. The person making the request is referred to as the plaintiff and the person against whom the request is made is referred to as the defendant. [2] A lawsuit is the right of every person who has a claim to bring it before the judiciary to obtain a judgment on its subject matter. For the opposing party, it is the right to present defenses or arguments aimed at refuting that claim.

The summons shall also specify the court before which the case is to be heard, the date set for the hearing, and the name, title, and date of service of the person serving the summons. The summons shall be signed by the person served, if they are able to sign, or a statement shall be made of their inability or refusal to sign. The summons shall also be signed by the person serving it. This record shall be added to the case file by the court clerk, a judicial officer responsible for maintaining the court's records and managing its documents.

The provisions of Articles 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 above shall apply to summonses before the court, a venue where litigation takes place between parties, being a civil court subject to the judicial authority which must have its independence within the three branches of government.  These provisions apply to the court to the extent they do not conflict with the specific rules of that court. (Added by Law No. 40 of 1963, dated November 14, 1963).
