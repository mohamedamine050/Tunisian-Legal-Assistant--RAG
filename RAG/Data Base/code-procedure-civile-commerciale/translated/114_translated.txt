The presiding judge shall open, manage, and conclude the pleadings when the matter before the court is sufficiently clear. The presiding judge shall open the pleadings by presenting the observations of the parties. If the court does not find sufficient explanations in the file, it may, on its own initiative, authorize the bringing of witnesses or experts to the hearing whose testimony it deems beneficial. It may, as necessary, authorize further investigation, and may also authorize the parties to appear in person.
