The judge, in all cases, may revoke authorizations issued by him, after hearing the parties. The applicant for revocation of the authorization must file a petition, served upon the opposing party by the bailiff, within a period not exceeding eight days from the date of his knowledge of the authorization, inviting the opposing party to appear before the judge who issued the authorization within a maximum period of eight days. The judgment rendered on the occasion of a request for revocation of the authorization must be reasoned.
