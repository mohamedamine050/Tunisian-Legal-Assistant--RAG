He must prepare a detailed report on all his actions, specifically noting the attendance or absence of the parties, stating their declarations and their signatures on these declarations, and outlining his technical opinion with clarity and the reasons on which it is based. If the examination was carried out by more than one expert, each of them may submit a separate report expressing their opinion, unless they agree to submit a single report outlining the opinion and reasons of each.
