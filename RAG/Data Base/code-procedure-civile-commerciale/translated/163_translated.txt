The Court shall first decide on the admissibility of the application for review in terms at a public hearing, and then set another hearing for the substantive arguments without the need for a summons. It may rule on the admissibility of the appeal in terms and on the merits by a single judgment if the parties have satisfied their requests on the merits.
