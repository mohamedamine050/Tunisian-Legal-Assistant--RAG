In the event of disagreement, the holder of the funds shall, within eight days following the expiration of the term stipulated in the preceding section, secure them with the Deposit and Consignment Fund for the benefit of all rational or objecting creditors. For this purpose, he shall specify in the request for security the names, titles, professions, and addresses of all rational creditors or those who objected to the proceeds of the sale or the funds subject to precautionary attachment. If the holder of the funds refuses to secure them or delays in securing them, he shall be requested to do so by the authorized judge. The competent court may further oblige him to pay interest and all fines.
