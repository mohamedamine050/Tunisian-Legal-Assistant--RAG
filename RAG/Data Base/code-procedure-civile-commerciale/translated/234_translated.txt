A defendant who wishes to prove the forgery or fraud of documents may file an incidental claim during the main action by requesting permission to prove forgery before the Court of First Instance.

**[1]** A claim is a request by one party (the plaintiff) against another party (the defendant) for the judge to rule on the matter. 

**[2]** A claim is the right of every party with a legal claim to seek a judgment from the court on their claim. It also grants the defendant the right to present arguments or defenses aimed at refuting that claim.

The Court of First Instance is typically the first court to hear the dispute and make a decision. The Court of First Instance is a court established to adjudicate between the parties, and is a civil court subordinate to the judicial authority, which must be independent within the three branches of government.

The decision of the Court of First Instance may be appealed to the Court of Appeal.
