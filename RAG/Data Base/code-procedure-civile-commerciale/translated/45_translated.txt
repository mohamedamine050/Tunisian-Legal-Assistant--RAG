(Amended by Law No. 59 of 1994 dated May 23, 1994).- When both parties appear before the judge voluntarily or after being summoned, the judge shall invite them to settle the matter. If they agree to a settlement, the judge shall order it to be recorded. Otherwise, the judge may adjudicate the matter immediately by a record of the clerk, after hearing the arguments of both parties and receiving their evidence. If the judge finds that the case is not ready for judgment, the judge shall order the necessary procedures to be completed within a specified time and shall verbally notify the parties to appear at the appointed hearing.
