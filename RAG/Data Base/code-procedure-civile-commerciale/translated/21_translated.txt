**Reference to the subject matter of the lawsuit is determined by the nature of the lawsuit:**

[1] A lawsuit arises when one party seeks their right from another in the presence of a judge. The party making the claim is called the plaintiff, and the party against whom the claim is made is called the defendant. 

[2] A lawsuit is the right of every claimant to present their claim to the court for a judgment in their favor. It is also the right of the defendant to present reasons for defense or arguments aimed at refuting the claim.

The amount of money claimed in the lawsuit and the final judgment amount are determined by the amount of money claimed. The most recent claims are considered, unless the court finds that the plaintiff deliberately increased or decreased the value of the claim with the intention of influencing the jurisdiction rules. In such a scenario, the court may adjust the value to its true amount and determine the jurisdiction based on the true value of the subject matter of the lawsuit.
