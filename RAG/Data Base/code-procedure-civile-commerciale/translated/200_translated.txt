A request for the censure of a judge shall be made by a petition signed by the applicant or his legal representative. The petition shall be filed with the Chief Justice, who shall then investigate the allegations. The Chief Justice shall hear the arguments of both the applicant and the judge, and then provide them with a fifteen-day period to submit their written observations. This investigation shall be conducted by the Chief Justice or a designated judge. The case file shall be submitted to the Attorney General at the Court of Cassation for his written observations. The Court shall then issue its decision based on the investigation findings. If the applicant's claim is rejected, he shall be fined between twenty and fifty dinars, regardless of any damages that the judge may be required to pay. If the censure is upheld, the judge shall be fined, ordered to pay court costs, and his actions shall be deemed null and void. However, a judgment in favor of the opposing party shall not be deemed null and void.
