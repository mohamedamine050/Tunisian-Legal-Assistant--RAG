The assignee shall directly collect from the debtor the amounts deducted upon presentation of a copy of the assignment declaration in the register prescribed in Article 387. However, if the assignment is subject to a writ of attachment [**عقلة**], which empowers the creditor holding an enforceable instrument to place the movable property in the possession of his debtor under the authority of the court, or to several previous writs of attachment, the deducted amounts shall be paid into the deposit and trust fund in accordance with the provisions of Article 374.
