From the date of registration of the precautionary objection, it shall not be permissible to register any transfer other than a sale that occurs following:

- The seizure which empowers a creditor holding an enforceable instrument to place the movable property in the possession of his debtor under the authority of the court, 
- or any optional mortgage, other real rights, any testamentary disposition, or any contract.

The objection registered on a jointly owned property shall not prevent the registration of the division or sale of the property unless it concerns the rights of all the co-owners. However, if it concerns the share of one of the co-owners, it shall be considered an objection as stipulated in Article 121 of the Real Rights Code and, where applicable, shall apply to the part of the property that falls within the debtor's share, so that the effects mentioned in the preceding paragraph shall result.
