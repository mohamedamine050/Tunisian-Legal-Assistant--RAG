An appeal filed after the legal deadline lapses. The respondent may, up to the closing of the pleadings, after the appellant has missed the appeal deadline or accepted the judgment before filing the original appeal, file a cross-appeal by a written memorandum containing the reasons for the appeal. However, this cross-appeal remains in effect as long as the original appeal remains in effect and ceases to exist upon its cessation unless the cessation of the original appeal is based on its withdrawal.
