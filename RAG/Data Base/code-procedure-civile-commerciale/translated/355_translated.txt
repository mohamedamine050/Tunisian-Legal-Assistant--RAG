In the event of the assignment or attachment of wages to fulfill alimony obligations, the entire amount due is taken upon its maturity from the portion of the wages not subject to attachment. The portion of wages subject to attachment may be further attached, as needed, either for the benefit of the guarantor of the alimony arrears or for the benefit of ordinary creditors who have the right to attach assets or to whom the wages have been assigned.
