The right to sue before the courts is granted to any person who possesses the legal capacity and qualification to make a claim for their right, provided that the claimant has a legitimate interest in the matter. However, in urgent cases, the suit may be accepted from a discerning minor if there is a tangible risk. It is the duty of the court to reject the lawsuit if it is evident from the case files that the claimant lacks the legal capacity to sue or does not have the standing to bring the claim. However, if the condition of limited legal capacity is rectified during the proceedings, the lawsuit will be considered valid. The court shall decide on the issues raised in this regard in accordance with the provisions of Article 16.
