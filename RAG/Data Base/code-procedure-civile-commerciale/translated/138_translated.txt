The respondent's counsel shall submit his client's arguments and documents in writing three days prior to the scheduled hearing, in duplicate, one copy to be added to the file and the other to be delivered to the appellant's counsel. The latter may, on the day of the hearing, request permission to respond to the opponent's arguments and documents, and the hearing may be adjourned accordingly. He shall then submit his response at least three days prior to the hearing, in duplicate, one copy to be added to the file and the other to be delivered to the respondent's counsel. 

The respondent may, if he so requests, submit a counter-memorandum with his arguments, which shall also be submitted three days prior to the hearing deadline, in duplicate, one copy to be added to the file and the other to be delivered to his counsel.
