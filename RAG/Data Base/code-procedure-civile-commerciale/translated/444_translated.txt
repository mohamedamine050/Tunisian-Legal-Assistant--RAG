**(Paragraph 2 of Law No. 82 of 2002 dated August 3, 2002 has been amended).** - The decision regarding the increase in the bid must be made after at least forty days and at most sixty days from the notification of the increase. The announcement of this decision and its implementation shall follow the same conditions as the first decision. If a higher price is not offered, the property shall be adjudicated to the person who made the increase, even if they are not present at the hearing, at the initial price including the price agreed upon by the contracting parties, whether it is higher or lower than the value of the sale, at which the property was initially adjudicated, and the increase offered. They shall be obligated to pay the appraised costs and fees, both those related to the initial decision and those arising from the sale pursuant to the increase. No further increase shall be accepted after the sale pursuant to the increase.
