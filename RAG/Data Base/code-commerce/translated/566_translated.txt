The appeal provided for in Articles 564 and 565 of this Chapter shall not suspend the execution of the judgment unless it is filed by the Public Prosecutor.

The Clerk of the Court of Appeal shall record the appeal application in a special register, deliver a receipt to the applicant, and issue a summons for the hearing at which the case will be listed. The date of this hearing shall be no less than one month from the date of receipt of the appeal application.

The Court of Appeal shall hear the appeal according to the procedures for expedited proceedings.

The President of the Court of Appeal seized with the matter may, exceptionally and upon the request of the appellant, authorize by a reasoned decision the suspension of the execution of the judgment appealed against for a period of one month, if the Court considers that the execution would make it impossible to restore the situation to its state prior to the execution.
