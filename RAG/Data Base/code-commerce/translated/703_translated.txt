If the lessee fails to pay one installment of the rent within the stipulated time, the lease agreement shall be terminated one month after the date the bank sends a registered letter with proof of delivery that remains unanswered. The bank shall recover possession of the safe deposit box through a summary judgment order that is enforceable on the draft judgment before its registration.

The lessee shall be notified by a bailiff to appear at the safe deposit box at the designated date and time. If the lessee fails to appear, the safe deposit box shall be opened by force in the presence of the bailiff, who shall draw up an inventory of its contents. This inventory shall be admissible as evidence against any interested party.

The bank shall retain the cash, securities, valuables, and other items included in the inventory, and shall deposit them in the lessee's name under the usual conditions. The bank may at any time deposit them in the safekeeping and deposit box. After one year from the date of the inventory, the bank may obtain authorization to sell them through a judicial officer appointed by order on a petition.

The sending of letters and delivery of documents shall be deemed to have been properly completed at the lessee's last known address, as known to the bank, or, if applicable, at the chosen address designated by the lessee at the time of the lease agreement.
