The trustee may not make any payment unless a debt certificate is presented to him. He must specify therein the amount paid or ordered to be paid pursuant to the provisions of Article 528 of this Code.

If it is impossible to obtain a debt certificate, the delegated judge may authorize the payment after reviewing the minutes of the debt examination. In all cases, the creditor's acknowledgment of receipt of the amount must be recorded in the margin of the distribution schedule.
