The purchaser, the seller, or any creditor shall deposit with the Court a copy of the insurance policy, a statement of the claims known to them, and a copy of the records entered on the commercial original. They shall present their request to the President who shall appoint a judge to summon their debtors and shall appoint a guardian to assist them, if necessary, in performing the actions prescribed in Article 261 or in any case to collect any remaining balance of the price and to pursue their insurance as each payment becomes due.

If the purchaser fails to pay what is due and to deposit the necessary securities, whether in the deposit and safekeeping box or in the hands of the guardian, then the latter shall be obliged to compel him to do so by all legal means, even if it requires them to seek authorization from the judge to sell the commercial original.
