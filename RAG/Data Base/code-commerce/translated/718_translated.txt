If the mortgagor fails to fulfill his obligations under the mortgage agreement, the secured creditor, by virtue of the formal mortgage contract, acquires a real right over the property designated to satisfy his debt. This right allows the secured creditor to take precedence over ordinary creditors and subsequent creditors in the order of priority, in recovering his right from the proceeds of the property, regardless of who possesses it. 

As a result of the mortgagor's default, the secured debt becomes immediately due and payable, unless the mortgagor, within a short period of time, provides new tangible collateral equivalent to the value of the mortgaged property, if the mortgaged property is lost or disappears.
