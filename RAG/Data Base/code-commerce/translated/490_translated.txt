In the event of the termination of the lease as stipulated in the preceding section, the landlord's claims arising from the rent during the observation period or from the date of the bankruptcy judgment to the date of the property's evacuation shall have the priority set forth in Article 450 of this Code. This shall not apply to the period during which a rescue plan was implemented, ending in bankruptcy.

In the event that the lease is not terminated, the landlord may only claim the payment of rent arrears after the bankruptcy judgment.
