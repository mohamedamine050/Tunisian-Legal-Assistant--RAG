The Judicial Administrator shall oversee the management of the debtor's assets, or assist the debtor in all or some of the management activities as determined by the President of the Court. The President of the Court may, exceptionally and by reasoned decision, entrust the Judicial Administrator with the full or partial management of the enterprise, with or without the assistance of the debtor. If the Judicial Administrator's role is limited to oversight, the President of the Court may specify the transactions that require the joint signature of the Judicial Administrator and the debtor. In case of any disagreement concerning the management or signature, the matter shall be referred to the supervising judge for immediate resolution.

Decisions assigning management to the Judicial Administrator or requiring joint signature with the debtor shall be entered in the commercial register and published in the Official Gazette of the Tunisian Republic.

During the period of judicial oversight, the debtor may not settle debts incurred prior to the initiation of the judicial settlement proceedings. The debtor may not dispose of or mortgage fixed assets without the authorization of the President of the Court. The President of the Court may prohibit the debtor from disposing of or mortgaging other assets without his authorization.

The Judicial Administrator shall ensure that the prohibition is published in the Official Gazette of the Tunisian Republic and registered with the commercial register, the property registers, and other public registers as appropriate. Any disposal made in violation of the prohibition shall be null and void, provided that an action for annulment is brought within three years of the completion of the disposal or from the date of its registration, as applicable.
