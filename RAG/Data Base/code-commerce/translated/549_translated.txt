The court, after closing the debt schedule provided for in Article 533 of this Code, and at the request of the debtor, at any stage of the proceedings, may rule on the closure of bankruptcy if the debtor proves that he has paid the debts of all the creditors who have requested their allocation within the scope of bankruptcy or that he has deposited with the trustee the amount due originally, in addition to interest and expenses, for the creditors who have requested their allocation.

A ruling on the closure of bankruptcy on the grounds of lack of creditor interest may only be issued based on a report from the appointed judge confirming the fulfillment of one of the aforementioned conditions. Upon the issuance of this judgment, the proceedings shall be definitively terminated, and all the debtor's rights shall be restored.
