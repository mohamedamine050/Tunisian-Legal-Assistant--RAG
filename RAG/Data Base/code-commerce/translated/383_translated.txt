The holder or bearer of the check may endorse it, which will have the consequences outlined in the following article.

Endorsement is effected by placing two parallel lines on the face of the check. Endorsement may be general or special. Endorsement is general if it does not contain between the lines any designation or the word "payable to" or its equivalent, and it is special if the name of a payee is written between the lines.

A general endorsement may be converted into a special endorsement, but a special endorsement may not be converted into a general endorsement.

Any striking out of the endorsement or the name of the designated payee is deemed non-existent.
