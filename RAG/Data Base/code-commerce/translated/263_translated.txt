If agreement on distribution is not reached in accordance with the provisions of the second paragraph of Article 262, the designated judge shall, within fifteen days, deposit with the Court a distribution list that also includes the installments of the price that have not yet become due.

If the creditors who are entitled by virtue of their rank do not have a share in the distribution of the due portion of the price, they must be paid according to their rank from the first amounts that become due. As for the creditors whose debts are unsecured, they shall be paid in all the installments that become due thereafter, according to the proportion of their debts.
