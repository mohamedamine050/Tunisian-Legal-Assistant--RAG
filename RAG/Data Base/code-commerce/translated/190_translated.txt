Any act concerning a commercial establishment, whether by optional sale, promise to sell, or total transfer, even if such act is subject to a condition or issued pursuant to a contract, must be evidenced by written documents, otherwise it shall be null and void. This applies even if the act is of a different nature or if it entails the transfer of the commercial establishment by division, partnership, or contribution to the capital of a company.

The transferor must specify in the transfer contract:

1) The name of the previous seller, the date of the transfer to them, its type, and its price, specifying the price of intangible elements, goods, and equipment separately.

2) A list containing the rights of privilege and mortgages registered against the commercial establishment.

3) The number of commercial transactions undertaken each year for the past three fiscal years, or from the date of the transfer to them if their exploitation has not lasted for three years.

4) The profits they have obtained during the same period.

5) If applicable, the lease of the premises, its date, duration, current rent amount, the name of the lessor, and their address.

The omission of the aforementioned details may result in the nullity of the sale contract at the request of the buyer, if this omission occurs within the year following its execution.
