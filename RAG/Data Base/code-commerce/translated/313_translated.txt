If a claim for recourse is brought after a partial acceptance of a bill of exchange, the party who paid the amount not covered by the acceptance is entitled to request that this payment be recorded on the bill of exchange and that a receipt be issued for it. Moreover, the holder is obligated to provide a copy of the bill of exchange certified as a true copy of the original, together with a formal protest, to enable the payer to bring an action for recourse in the future.
