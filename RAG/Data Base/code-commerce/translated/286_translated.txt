If the drawer in a bill of exchange designates a place for payment different from the place of the drawee's domicile, without designating another person to receive payment, the drawee may designate a person upon acceptance. If the drawee accepts without designating a person, it shall be presumed that the drawee has undertaken to pay personally at the place of payment. If the bill of exchange is payable at the drawee's domicile, the drawee may, in the acceptance form, designate an address at the same place where payment is due.
