However, the party to whom performance is made remains bound by the requirements of each alternative method included in the agreement that has not been withdrawn.

If the offeror has assigned the alternative methods to different persons, the offeror and its successors-in-interest are bound by the requirements of all the alternative methods included in their signature, which have not been revoked.
