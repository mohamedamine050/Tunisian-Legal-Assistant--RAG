The appointed judge shall preside over the meeting of creditors and may, if he sees fit, seek assistance from the clerk assigned to him by the president of the court to prepare the distribution list and perform any acts related to the distribution. On the appointed day for the meeting, the appointed judge shall draw up a record in the presence of the parties, and the delivery of the liquidation requests, and the evidence. This record shall establish the occurrence of the summons of the registered creditors or objectors. He shall receive the observations of the parties present or their attorneys, and shall declare the forfeiture of the rights of the creditors who failed to provide within the deadline what was required of them to be included in the liquidation. If an agreement is reached on the method of distribution, the judge shall be required to draw up a record of the liquidation in the distribution of the price by mutual consent.
