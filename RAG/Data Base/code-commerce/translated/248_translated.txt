It is not permissible to sell one or more of the elements that constitute the commercial asset encumbered with liens separately, if the sale request is pursuant to an enforcement order or in accordance with the conditions contained in this chapter, except after ten days at least from the date of notification to the creditors who have registered their liens prior to the aforementioned notification at least fifteen days in the place chosen by each of them for the registration specific to them. Within the ten-day period, each registered creditor may either settle their debt or, if they do not settle, may file a lawsuit with the court in whose jurisdiction the commercial asset is located, requesting the issuance of permission to sell all its elements, at the request of the plaintiff or at their own request, in accordance with the provisions stipulated in Articles 243, 244 and 245 previously mentioned. The sale of equipment and goods with the commercial asset shall take place at the same time, either by setting an opening price for each of the items sold or by different prices, if the conditions require the buyer to deliver them at a price determined by experts.

The price shall be divided among the different elements of the commercial asset that are not encumbered with a lien. This chapter shall not apply in the case of a request to sell in accordance with the provisions relating to the sale of motor vehicles or tractors with deferred payment or the sale of machinery and equipment.
