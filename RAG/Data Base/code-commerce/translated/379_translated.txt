In the event of the loss or theft of a cheque, its owner may request payment of its value based on a second, third, and fourth copy, and so on. If the owner is unable to present a second, third, fourth, or subsequent copy of the cheque due to its loss or theft, they may request payment of the value of the lost or stolen cheque and obtain it by obtaining authorization on a petition after proving their ownership of the instrument through their records and providing a guarantor.
