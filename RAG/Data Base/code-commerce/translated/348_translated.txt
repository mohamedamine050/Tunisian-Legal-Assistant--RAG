It is not permissible to draw a check except on a bank that has funds at its disposal in the name of the drawer at the time of the instrument's creation, and pursuant to an express or implied agreement that gives the drawer the right to dispose of these funds by issuing a check.

The term “bank” encompasses persons or institutions legally equivalent to banks.

The drawer or the person on whose account the check is drawn is responsible for maintaining sufficient funds, although a drawer on another person's account remains personally liable to the payee and the holder, and no one else. The drawer alone is obligated, in the event of denial, to prove that at the time of its creation, the person who drew the check on the drawer's account had funds available; otherwise, the drawer guarantees the existence of the funds, even if the objection is raised after the legal deadlines have passed.

Instruments drawn and payable in Tunisian dinars to persons other than those mentioned in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Chapter, and which are drawn in the form of a check, cannot be considered as checks.
