(Amended by Article 2 of Law No. 36 of 2016 dated April 29, 2016).

The courts may not access the entire books of account except in cases of inheritance, partnership, amicable settlement, or bankruptcy. In all other cases, the presentation of the books of account, or a request for their production, or authorization to do so, may always be sought from the judge directly in order to extract the relevant information pertaining to the dispute.
