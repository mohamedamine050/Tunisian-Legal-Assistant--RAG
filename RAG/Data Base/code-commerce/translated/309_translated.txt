If the drawer, endorser, or guarantor of a bill of exchange stipulates a condition of return without expenses or without protest, or any similar condition, with their signature on the bill, they may thereby exempt the holder from the obligation to draw up a protest upon refusal of acceptance or payment, should they wish to pursue a recourse action.

However, this stipulated condition does not exempt the holder from presenting the bill of exchange within the stipulated timeframes, nor from giving the necessary notices.

The burden of proof regarding the non-observance of these timeframes shall be upon the party asserting it against the holder.

If the stipulated condition was imposed by the drawer, its effects extend to all signatories, including the endorser and guarantor. If, however, the condition was imposed by the endorser or guarantor, its effects are limited to them only. Should the holder file a protest despite the condition included by the drawer, they shall bear the related expenses. If the condition was imposed by the endorser or guarantor and a protest is filed, the expenses may be recovered from all signatories.
