If the current account reveals a balance that constitutes a debt owed to the person who surrendered the bonds in the event of their bankruptcy, after verification through the corresponding title, the recipient must return the bonds.  Should it transpire, after recording the bonds against the corresponding title, that the current account balance constitutes a debt owed by the person who surrendered the bonds in the event of their bankruptcy, the recipient may retain the bonds regardless of the maturity date.  Nevertheless, the recipient may collect the amounts owed at a later date from those obligated under the bonds by exercising the rights and guarantees associated with the bonds recorded against the corresponding debt title and receiving the share allocated to them from the bankruptcy estate to satisfy the debt arising from the account balance after the bonds were recorded against the corresponding title.  All of this is subject to the provisions of Article 742 below.
