The term of the trustee's mandate is set at one year. In the event that the liquidation proceedings are not concluded before the expiry of this term, the trustee must submit a report explaining the reasons for the non-completion of the liquidation and propose new deadlines for its completion.

The term of the trustee's mandate may be renewed once or twice for the same period by a reasoned decision of the Court.
