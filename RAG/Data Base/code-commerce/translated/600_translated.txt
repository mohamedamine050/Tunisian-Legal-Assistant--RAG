In all cases, the right of the mortgage creditor is not maintained on the mortgage, except when the mortgaged thing agreed upon has been delivered to him or to another person and has not left the possession of one of them.

**The mortgage is a formal contract by which the creditor acquires a real right on a property designated for the satisfaction of his debt. By virtue of this right, he is entitled to take precedence over ordinary creditors and subsequent creditors in the order of payment of his claim from the proceeds of that property, in whichever hands it may be.** 

The creditor is considered to be in possession of the goods when they are at his disposal in his warehouses, ships, or barges, or in a public warehouse, or when he has in his possession, prior to their arrival, their bill of lading, consignment note, or other similar transport documents.
