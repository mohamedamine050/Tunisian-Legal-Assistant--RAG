If several individuals successively undertake the execution of a contract for the carriage of goods:

1) The first and last carriers shall be jointly and severally liable to the consignor and consignee for all acts of carriage, as if each of them had undertaken all of them on the same terms as stipulated in this article.

2) Each intermediary in the carriage shall guarantee to the consignor and consignee, and to the first and last carriers, the damage incurred during the distance traveled by each of them.

If the distance during which the damage occurred cannot be determined, the carrier who has borne the burden of repairing the damage shall have the right to partial recourse against each of the successive carriers, in proportion to the distance traveled by each. The necessary contributions shall be distributed among all of them, taking into account the aforementioned proportion.
