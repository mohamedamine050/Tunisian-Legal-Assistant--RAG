The second and third paragraphs were added by Law No. 28 of 1996, dated April 3, 1996. The holder of a bill of exchange, in which a protest of non-payment is recorded, in addition to the procedures required for pursuing a guarantee claim, may obtain an order by petition for the execution of a *saisie-conservatoire*. 

This *saisie-conservatoire* authorizes the creditor holding an executory instrument to place the movable property in the possession of his debtor under the authority of the court, as a precautionary measure against the property of the drawers, acceptors, and endorsers of the bill of exchange.

The holder of the bill of exchange may also obtain a payment order against the acceptor, which shall be executed twenty-four hours after notification, and regardless of any appeal.

The holder of the bill of exchange may also initiate the same procedure against other obligors if they are liable to him.

Exceptionally, the President of the Court of Appeal may authorize the suspension of the execution of the appealed payment order for a period of one month if the execution would cause irreparable harm. The authorization to suspend execution shall only be granted after hearing the parties. The decision issued by the President of the Court of Appeal is not subject to any form of appeal. (This last paragraph was added by Law No. 37 of 2007, dated June 4, 2007).
