Every holder of the price paid for the sale of a commercial asset is obligated to distribute it within a period of three months from the date of the sale agreement. 

Upon the expiration of this period, it is permissible for the interested parties to immediately initiate proceedings before the President of the Court within whose jurisdiction the commercial asset falls.  In this case, the President shall authorize either the deposit of the price in the deposit and safekeeping fund or the appointment of a trustee to be entrusted with the distribution.
