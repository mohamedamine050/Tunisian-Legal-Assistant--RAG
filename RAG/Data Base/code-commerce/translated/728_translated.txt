A current account is established when two individuals agree to engage in a continuous transaction, entering into an account by way of payments made by each to the other, where the resulting debts of each party arising from transactions between them are not subject to any form of appeal and are deemed inseparable. Instead of settling each transaction individually as it arises, the parties agree to a single final settlement based on the balance of the account upon its closure.

The rules relating to current accounts, as stipulated in Article 729 and subsequent articles, do not apply if it is stipulated that the payments made by one party are not to be proved until the other party has completed their payments.
