The Court shall not rule on the approval of a Business Continuation Plan unless it has been agreed to by the creditors covered by it, whose claims represent at least half of the claims secured by the said plan, and after verifying that it takes into account the interests of the creditors (amended by Law No. 47 of 2019 dated May 29, 2019). The approved Business Continuation Plan shall apply to all creditors.

The Business Continuation Plan cannot include a reduction of the principal debt without the consent of the creditor, nor can it include a debt repayment schedule except within a period not exceeding seven years unless the creditor or creditors agree otherwise.

The Business Continuation Plan may differentiate the repayment deadlines according to the creditors' situations and the company's ability to pay.

The postponement of debt payments does not apply to the amounts referred to in Articles 541 and 571 of this Code and in Article 199 of the Code of Real Rights, with the exception of paragraph four. Small debts up to five percent of the total debt, each of which does not exceed half of one percent of the total debt, may be excluded from the postponement. Priority shall be given to the smallest debt. This exception does not apply to debts exceeding half of one percent of the total debt or debts that were the subject of settlement or payment by a third party.
