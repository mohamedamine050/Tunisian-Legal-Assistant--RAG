The urgency judge is not permitted to grant the requested license unless the creditors have been given the opportunity to file objections to the deposit amount held by him and to the buyer, who must be included in the case by means of a clear statement, which shall bind them personally with a guarantee and be written to the effect that there are no other opposing creditors other than those who were included in the dispute. The buyer's liability towards other creditors who filed objections before the issuance of this decision, if any, shall not be discharged by the execution of the President's decision regarding the purchase price.
