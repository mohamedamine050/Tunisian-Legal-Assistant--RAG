Irrespective of any contrary stipulation, contracts binding the institution with third parties, including clients, suppliers, and others, shall remain in effect. The court may terminate these contracts at the request of the judicial administrator if they are no longer necessary for the continuation of the institution's activities and their termination would not cause significant harm to the contracting party. Employment contracts shall remain subject to their specific laws and agreements.

The judicial administrator shall notify the contracting parties with whom the institution has decided to terminate contracts within fifteen days prior to the termination date, by registered mail with acknowledgment of receipt.
