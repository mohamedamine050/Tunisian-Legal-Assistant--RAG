The trustee shall examine the debts with the assistance of the bankruptcy supervisors, if they have been appointed, and in the presence of the debtor or after summoning him by registered mail with a certificate of receipt.

If the trustee doubts all or part of the debt, he shall notify the creditor thereof by registered mail with a certificate of receipt.

The creditor shall submit his written explanations within fifteen days. The trustee shall present his proposals to the delegated judge, who shall issue a reasoned decision on each debt and shall provide him, along with his proposals, a schedule of the privileged debts.

After the approval of the delegated judge, the trustee may refrain from examining the debts if the company has no assets, and if its assets are insignificant, he may limit the examination to documented debts.

Bills issued by commercial companies pursuant to the law are exempt from the debt examination procedures.
