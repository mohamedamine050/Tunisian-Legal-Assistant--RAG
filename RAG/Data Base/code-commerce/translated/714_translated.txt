## English Translation:

The **mortgage** is a formal contract by which the creditor acquires a real right over a property dedicated to the fulfillment of his debt, giving him the right to take precedence over ordinary creditors and subsequent creditors in the order of priority in recovering his claim from the sale proceeds of that property, regardless of who holds it. 

The **mortgage** legally applies to the entire thing upon the termination of the right to enjoy its yield if the owner of the property is the one who entered into the **contract** to **mortgage** the bonds subject to the right to enjoy their yield. 

A **contract** is a legally binding agreement that obliges the contracting parties and defines their obligations and rights in relation to the specific transaction.
