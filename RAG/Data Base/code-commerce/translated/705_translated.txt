**English Translation:**

A letter of credit requires the establishment of means of payment up to a certain amount of money, directly or indirectly, at the disposal of the beneficiary. 

The grant of a letter of credit may be for a limited or unlimited period. In the latter case, the bank may revoke it at its own discretion, but it must give eight days' written notice by registered mail prior to such revocation. Any condition contrary to this provision shall be null and void.
