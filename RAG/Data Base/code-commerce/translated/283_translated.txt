The acceptance of a bill of exchange may be presented to the drawee at his domicile until the due date, whether by the holder or by any other person in possession of it.

The drawer may include in every bill of exchange a stipulation that it must be presented for acceptance, with or without fixing a time limit for such presentation. He may also prohibit, by the terms of the bill itself, presentation for acceptance, unless the bill is payable at a place other than the domicile of the drawee or is drawn for payment after a period of sight.

He may also stipulate that the presentation for acceptance may not take place before a certain date.

The payee of the bill of exchange may stipulate that it must be presented for acceptance, with or without fixing a time limit for such presentation, unless the drawer has declared that presentation for acceptance is prohibited.

Bills payable at a period after sight must be presented for acceptance within one year from their date.

The drawer may specify a shorter or longer period than the period mentioned above.

The payees may shorten the periods mentioned.

If the bill of exchange was drawn to execute a commercial agreement for the supply of goods, and the drawer has fulfilled the obligations he undertook under the contract, the drawee may not refuse to declare acceptance upon the lapse of a reasonable time, as per the usual practice in trade, to examine the goods.

Failure to accept the bill of exchange shall, as a matter of law, result in the lapse of the time limit, with the costs and expenses being borne by the drawee.
