Priority shall be given to new debts incurred by the enterprise from the commencement of the monitoring period, which are directly and necessarily related to the continuation of its activity, and to rent payments for real estate and movable property which are the subject of a financial lease and are essential to the continuation of the enterprise's activity, the enforcement proceedings for the recovery of which have been suspended and the maturity date of which falls before the commencement of the monitoring period, and these shall be collected before other previous debts, even if they are privileged.
