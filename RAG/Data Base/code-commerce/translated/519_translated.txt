The secretary shall draw up the inventory list in two copies, in the presence of the designated judge or his deputy, and both shall sign the list. One of these two copies shall be deposited with the court clerk, and the other shall remain with the secretary.

The secretary may, if he wishes, seek assistance from whomever he chooses in drawing up the inventory list and in appraising the objects.

It is the duty of the secretary to identify the objects that are exempt from sealing, or that have been extracted from sealed objects and have been inventoried and appraised.
