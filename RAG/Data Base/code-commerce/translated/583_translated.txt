If the matter concerns mortgage creditors who have only received a portion of the distribution of the property's price, the following action will be taken: their debts shall be fully recovered from the portion allocated to ordinary creditors, to the extent of the amounts due, after deducting their share of the distribution of the property's price. Any amount received by them in excess of this share in the previous distribution shall be deducted, and the remainder shall be returned to the ordinary creditors.
