Firstly: Donations and gratuitous transfers, except for customary modest gifts.

Secondly: Any payment of debts not yet due, in any form.

Thirdly: Any performance of an obligation in kind, or any payment of monetary debts that have become due, by means other than cash, bills of exchange, promissory notes, checks, bank transfers, bank cards, or any other customary means of payment in the debtor's field of activity, taking into account the rights acquired by third parties in good faith.

Fourthly: The establishment of a real estate mortgage and the registration thereof on the debtor's assets to secure a prior debt.

The Court may also declare null and void any other payment made by the debtor in settlement of debts that have become due, and any onerous act performed by the debtor that is not in accordance with the foregoing, after the suspension of debt payments, if the persons who received the payment or entered into the contract were aware of the suspension of debt payments.

The aforementioned claims must be brought within two years following the settlement judgment, otherwise they shall lapse by prescription.
