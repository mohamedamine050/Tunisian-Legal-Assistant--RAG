The declaration made after the expiry of the deadline shall have the same consequences as a previous declaration. However, a declaration made following the objection based on the refusal to pay or after the expiry of the deadline specified for lodging the objection shall only have the consequences of ordinary referral.

A declaration without a stated date shall be deemed to have been made before the expiry of the deadline specified for lodging the objection, unless evidence to the contrary is presented.

The submission of dates for payment orders is prohibited, otherwise it shall be considered forgery.
