If the program includes a change to the founding contract of the institution, the court shall appoint a court-appointed receiver and set a deadline for him to carry out the necessary procedures to complete that change. If the program includes an increase in the company's capital, the court-appointed receiver shall be responsible for completing the obligations.

Subscribers to the increase in capital must pay in full the amount they have committed to immediately. Creditors whose debts are registered in the schedule without any legal dispute can subscribe to all or part of the current debts. If the debt is not current, they will not benefit from this procedure unless they waive a portion of their debt, determined by the court, which shall not be less than the amount of the agreed-upon surplus between the parties for the portion that has not matured.

The conversion of creditors' full or partial debts into shares in the capital of the debtor institution is not contingent upon the approval of the shareholders or partners therein.
