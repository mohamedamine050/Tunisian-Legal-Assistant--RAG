Unless otherwise stipulated in the express private agreement referred to in the second paragraph of Article 729, the effect of the guarantee originally relating to a debt owed by one party and included in the current account shall be transferred, to the extent of the guaranteed debt, to the balance of the account, if it exists, without regard to the changes that may occur in the result of the said account until its closure.

However, the transfer of this guarantee may not be invoked against non-contracting parties unless it has been publicized in the manner prescribed by law for the preservation of the guarantee deemed to be valid.
