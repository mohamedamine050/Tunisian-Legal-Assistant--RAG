The drawer, endorser, and guarantor of the bill of exchange are all jointly and severally liable to the holder.

The holder has the right to proceed against these individuals individually or collectively, without being required to observe any order in which their obligations arose.

This right is established for any holder of the bill of exchange upon payment of its value.

An action brought against one of the obligors does not preclude recourse against the others, even if they are entitled to compensation from the person against whom the action was first brought.
