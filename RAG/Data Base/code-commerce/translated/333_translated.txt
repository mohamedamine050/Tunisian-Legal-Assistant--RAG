The original document must be identified in the copy, and the holder of the original must deliver it to the lawful holder of the copy.

If the holder of the original refuses to deliver it, the holder of the copy may not bring a claim against the endorsers or guarantors of the copy unless they prove, by protest, that the original was not delivered to them despite their request.

If, after the last endorsement on the original, a new endorsement is made before the copy is extracted, containing the condition expressed by the phrase “From here on, any endorsement must be made on the copy” or a similar phrase, then any subsequent endorsement made on the original shall be null and void.
