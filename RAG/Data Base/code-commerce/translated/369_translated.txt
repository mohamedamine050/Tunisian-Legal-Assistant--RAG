If the endorsement contains the phrase "value for collection" or "for receipt" or "by proxy" or any other phrase that indicates a simple power of attorney, then the holder may exercise all rights accruing to the check, but he may not endorse it except in the manner of an agency.

The obligors in this manner may not assert any claim against the holder, except through the means of opposition that the endorser may oppose with.

The agency included in the power of attorney endorsement does not terminate upon the death of the principal or his loss of capacity.
