The buyer, from the date of sale until the expiry of twenty days from its publication in the Official Gazette of the Tunisian Republic, shall deposit at the chosen place a copy of the original sales contract, if it is handwritten, or a copy of it if it is a formal document. He shall also enable any creditor or opponent to inspect it, and they may inspect it or take a copy without removing it from its location.

The seller may, within the same period, inspect the objections and take copies of them. "If the commercial principal is subject to registered mortgages, the buyer shall, within the same period, inform the registered creditors through an authorized bailiff, at the address specified in their respective registrations, to state their objections. Failure to do so will prevent him from contesting against the creditors for the price paid."
