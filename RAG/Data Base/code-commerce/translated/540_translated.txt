The trustee shall endeavor to collect the maximum possible amount of debts.

Following the approval of the assigned judge, the trustee may refer them to a debt collection company in accordance with the current legislation. If the matter concerns debts, each of which does not exceed one-half percent of the total debts and their total does not exceed 5 percent of the total debts, and their maturity date has not yet arrived on the date of commencement of the bankruptcy proceedings, and their collection would require a long time and significant expenses considering their value and chances of collection, they may be abandoned and written off by a court decision based on a report from the trustee, which is submitted to the assigned judge who provides a reasoned opinion after receiving the opinion of the observers, whenever it becomes apparent that they cannot be collected within a reasonable timeframe and there are no takers.
