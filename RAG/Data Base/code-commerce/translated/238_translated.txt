The mortgage is established by a formal contract or a handwritten contract registered in accordance with the law. The existence of the privilege arising from the mortgage is determined upon its registration in the public register kept by the secretariat of the court within whose jurisdiction the original commercial document is located.

Registration must be effected on the same form by the secretariat of the court within whose jurisdiction each branch of the original commercial document covered by the mortgage is located.
