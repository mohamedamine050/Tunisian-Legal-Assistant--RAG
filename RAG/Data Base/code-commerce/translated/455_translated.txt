The Court orders the continuation of the enterprise's activity, based on a report, which constitutes a form of information transmission, formulated in a semi-final state to reach the judicial officer. This decision is made when there are serious possibilities for the continuation of the activity, retaining all or some of the employment and debt settlement. The continuation of the activity can be accompanied by the sale or transfer of some of the enterprise's assets or subsidiary activities. 

If the transfer relates to a branch or a group of branches of the enterprise's activity or to real estate, the procedures stipulated in the fourth section of this chapter shall be followed.

The debtor may not transfer or mortgage the fixed assets recorded in the enterprise's balance sheet during the period required for the implementation of the activity continuation program, except with the authorization of the Court. The Court may prohibit the debtor from transferring or mortgaging other assets except with its authorization.

The execution supervisor shall ensure that the prohibition is published in the Official Gazette of the Tunisian Republic, registered in the commercial register, land registry, and other public registers as appropriate. Any transfer made contrary to the prohibition is null and void, provided that an action to invalidate it is filed within three years from the completion of the transfer or from the date of its registration, as the case may be.

A judgment ordering the continuation of the activity results in the enterprise regaining its right to participate in public tenders, regardless of any contrary provisions.
