The bank shall be responsible for collecting the interest, dividends, and amounts due from the principal or paid to redeem the bonds, and generally all sums that are due under the deposited bonds upon their maturity date, unless otherwise stipulated.

The collected amounts shall be placed at the disposal of the depositor, particularly by crediting them to the depositor's account within their existing debt. The bank shall also request the delivery of bonds that are granted free of charge and include them in the deposit.

Furthermore, it shall undertake any operations that are intended to preserve the rights related to the bonds, such as unification, opposition, replacement of coupons, and endorsements.
