A judgment declaring bankruptcy results in the creditors recovering their rights through individual execution against the debtor, guarantors, and joint debtors.

However, the court may rule in a judgment declaring bankruptcy that the creditors recover their aforementioned rights in one of the following cases:

- If the debt arises from a criminal judgment against the debtor,

- If the debt is related to the creditor's personal status,

- If the debtor is convicted of causing bankruptcy, obstructing settlement procedures, or fraud,

- If the debtor has been subject to bankruptcy proceedings during the five years preceding the bankruptcy judgment,

- If it is proven that the debtor has committed fraud during rescue or bankruptcy proceedings,

- If the creditor is a guarantor or joint debtor with the debtor.
