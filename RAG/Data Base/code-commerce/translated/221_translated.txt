If the sale is rescinded, the seller shall be obliged to recover all the elements of the commercial asset that were covered by the sale, even those that were subject to a privilege in his favor or a right to bring an action for rescission, both of which have expired. However, his recovery of the goods shall be limited to the price obtained by the sale. The seller shall be held accountable for the price of the goods and equipment present in the establishment upon regaining possession, as assessed by experts in the presence of both parties, or as agreed upon by them, or as determined by the judge. The price shall be reduced by the amount that he is entitled to under the privilege he has on the price of each of the goods and equipment, individually. If anything remains after that, it shall be held as security for registered creditors, or, if none exist, for unsecured creditors, up to the amount of their debts.
