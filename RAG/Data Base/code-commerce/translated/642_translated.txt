If the movable goods are subject to loss of weight or measure during transport, the carrier is only liable for the amount of loss exceeding the customary tolerance.

The limitation of liability as stated in the preceding paragraph may only be invoked if it is proven that the loss in question did not actually arise from reasons justifying the tolerance.

If the movable goods are transported under a single transport ticket and are divided into several parts or packages, the tolerance shall be calculated for each part or package if its weight upon dispatch was individually stated on the transport ticket or can be proven by other means.
