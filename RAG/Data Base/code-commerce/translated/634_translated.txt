The sender has the right to change the name of the consignee or to reclaim the movable property as long as it remains in the possession of the carrier, on condition that he pays the carrier the freight for the distance covered and compensates him for any expenses incurred and losses suffered due to its reclamation.

However, the sender cannot exercise this right:

1) If the bill of lading has been delivered to the consignee, this right is transferred to the consignee.

2) If the sender has received the bill of lading but is unable to produce it.

3) If the consignee requests to receive the goods after they have arrived at the place of destination.
