The declaration of bankruptcy shall not result in the termination of the lease of the premises allocated to the debtor's business activity, and any provision contrary to this shall be null and void.

For a period of three months from the date of the bankruptcy judgment, any enforcement proceedings initiated by the lessor, particularly those aimed at evicting the lessee from the leased premises, shall be suspended. This suspension is necessary to preserve the assets of the enterprise, as the lease payments are not guaranteed. However, this shall not preclude the taking of precautionary measures, nor shall it affect the rights acquired by the lessor prior to the declaration of bankruptcy.

The lessor shall be able to recover the leased premises. However, the lessor must initiate legal action within the aforementioned period to claim the rights acquired.

After obtaining authorization from the designated judge, the trustee may terminate the lease or continue it while fulfilling the obligations incumbent upon the lessee. The trustee must notify the lessor of their intention to terminate or continue the lease within the period specified in the second paragraph of this chapter, by means of a registered letter with proof of delivery.

The lessor who wishes to initiate proceedings for termination of the lease due to the bankruptcy shall file their claim within fifteen days of receiving the aforementioned notification. The court shall issue a judgment of termination if it deems the guarantees offered insufficient.
