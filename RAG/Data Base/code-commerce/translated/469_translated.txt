If it appears possible to save the establishment by leasing it to a third party, with the option of transferring ownership to them, then the lease term shall not exceed two years in any case. Ownership of the establishment shall transfer to the lessee upon the expiration of the lease term and the fulfillment of all obligations incumbent upon them.

Should the lessee fail to complete the purchase of the establishment within the month following the expiration of the lease term, in accordance with the conditions stipulated in this Chapter, the court shall decide anew on transferring the establishment to a third party, leasing it, granting it under a free agency agreement, or declaring it bankrupt, pursuant to the provisions of this Code. The defaulting party shall bear the difference in value and the expenses incurred due to their default, and shall not be entitled to claim any increase in value. Furthermore, the debtor, any creditor, or some of them, may claim compensation for any damages exceeding that amount.
