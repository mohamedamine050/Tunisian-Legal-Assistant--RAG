If the commercial asset includes trademarks, trade names, industrial designs, or models, in addition to the aforementioned requirements, it must be registered with the competent Industrial Property Authority after the certificate issued by the clerk of the Court of First Instance is presented within fifteen days of the sale registration. Otherwise, no one other than the contracting parties may claim that the sale included trademarks, trade names, industrial designs, or models.

Patents included in the sale of the commercial asset remain subject to the rules governing their transfer as provided by the law concerning the protection of industrial property.
