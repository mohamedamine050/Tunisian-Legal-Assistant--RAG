Every account shall be subject to a balance statement at least once a year, or multiple times if so stipulated by custom or agreement. A copy of the balance statement, prepared as of the date of its last closure, shall be sent to the account holder, detailing the balance carried forward into the renewed account.

No request for amendment of the account shall be accepted, even if it is due to a mere error, omission, or repetition, if the entries date back more than three years, unless the depositor or the bank has taken precautions within the same period by registered letter with acknowledgment of receipt and notification of delivery, or unless the depositor has notified the bank by registered letter with acknowledgment of receipt and notification of delivery of their failure to receive a copy of the account in the manner described in the preceding paragraph. Any provision contrary to the foregoing provisions shall be considered null and void.

The bank shall notify the account holder of a closed account by any means leaving a written trace, to return the checkbooks in their possession, within a period not exceeding fifteen days from the date of closure. (The last paragraph was added by Law No. 37 of 2007 dated June 4, 2007.)
