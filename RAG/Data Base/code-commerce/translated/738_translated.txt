(Amended by Law No. 36 of 2016 dated April 29, 2016). In the event that one of the parties is subject to judicial settlement or bankruptcy proceedings, any mortgage, whether conventional, judicially ordered, or any right of encumbrance on the debtor's assets, which is created during the period provided for in Articles 446 and 494 of this Code, to secure the balance of the current account which may become a debt owed by the debtor, shall be null and void, if the current account has resulted in a proven debt owed by the debtor party.

However, creditors may assert this security with regard to any surplus, if any, over the balance of the account settled upon its closure, which includes the difference resulting from the comparison between this balance and the result that was generated from the debtor's balance, unless Articles 446 and 495 of this Code require their application.
