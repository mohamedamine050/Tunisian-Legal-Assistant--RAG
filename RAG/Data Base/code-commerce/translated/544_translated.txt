The delegated judge, after hearing the debtor's statements or summoning them by registered letter with acknowledgement of receipt, may authorize the bailiff to sell movable property or goods.

If the matter concerns the sale of movable assets or real estate belonging to the debtor, the court may decide to sell it after calling for bids from interested buyers in sealed envelopes. The envelopes are opened in the deliberation chamber, and the sale is awarded to the highest bidder. The court may decide to call for improved bids, in which case the bailiff shall inform the bidders of this decision within two days of its issuance. The bailiff receives bids submitted to him within the following fifteen days and forwards them to the court in their sealed envelopes. The court shall choose the best bid and may again call for improved bids following the same procedure.

Exceptionally, the sale may be conducted by auction if the court decides so by a reasoned decision and after obtaining the opinion of the Public Prosecutor's Office.

If the matter concerns the sale of agricultural real estate, the court shall take into account the preservation of its economic unit. The transfer of agricultural land shall only be for the benefit of natural persons of Tunisian nationality or for the benefit of Tunisian institutions or legal persons, without leading to the ownership of agricultural land by foreign natural persons.
