The parties are not subject to any limitations in determining the terms of the settlement agreement. This agreement may include debt scheduling, debt reduction, suspension of interest accrual, and other means.

The President of the Court approves the agreement reached between the debtor and all creditors. They can also approve an agreement signed by creditors representing two-thirds of the total debt, authorizing the scheduling of the remaining debts, regardless of their nature, for a period not exceeding the duration of the agreement, but not exceeding three years in any case.

Excluded from this are the debts stipulated in Articles 541 and 571 of this Code and in Article 199 of the Code of Real Rights, with the exception of its fourth paragraph, as well as small debts amounting to five percent of the total debt, each of which does not exceed one half of one percent of the total debt. Priority in determining the excluded small debts shall be given to the smallest debt.

The approved agreement shall be deposited in writing with the Court, which shall enter it in the commercial register and inform the Committee for the Follow-up of Economic Institutions of its contents by official means.

The settlement agreement shall result, for the creditors covered by it, in the suspension of enforcement proceedings aimed at the recovery of a debt prior to the settlement agreement, or at the recovery of movable or immovable property due to non-payment of a debt until the end of the agreement's term.
