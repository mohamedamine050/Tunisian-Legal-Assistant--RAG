It shall deliver check forms if no reply is received within three working days from the date of the Central Bank of Tunisia’s communication of the request for inquiry.

It shall deliver check forms with a maximum value limit or forms of certified checks, whether certified or non-certified, expressly stating that they are not subject to any form of appeal except for the benefit of a bank or a similar financial institution, or for the benefit of a post office cashier or a general accountant.

The bank may refuse to deliver check forms to the account holder other than those delivered for direct withdrawal or for a letter of credit.
