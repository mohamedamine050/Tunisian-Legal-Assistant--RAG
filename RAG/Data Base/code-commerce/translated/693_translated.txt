Operations where the owner has the right of option shall be notified to the depositor. In the event of confirmation or risk of rights being lost, the bank must issue a notice by registered mail with acknowledgment of receipt and notification of delivery. In all cases, the costs of correspondence shall be borne by the depositor in addition to the usual fee. 

The bank must pursue, on behalf of the depositor, any rights that the depositor has not exercised personally in the event of a failure to receive instructions from the depositor in a timely manner.
