A broker is only entitled to his brokerage fee if he successfully mediates the conclusion of the contract.

If the contract is subject to a suspensive condition, the broker is only entitled to the fee after the condition has been fulfilled.

If the promised brokerage fee is excessive in relation to the importance of the work performed by the broker, it may be reduced unless it is the fee stipulated in the contract or paid after its conclusion in the manner prescribed in the first paragraph of this chapter.

If the reimbursement of expenses incurred by the broker is stipulated, it shall be payable to him even if the contract is not concluded.
