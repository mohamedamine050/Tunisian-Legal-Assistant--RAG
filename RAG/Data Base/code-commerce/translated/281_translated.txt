If the bill of exchange contains the phrase "value for collection" or "for payment" or "by proxy" or any other phrase implying a mere mandate, the holder may exercise all rights arising from the bill of exchange, but he may not endorse it except by way of procuration.

In this case, the obligors may not oppose the holder except by means of the objections with which they could have opposed the endorser.

The procuration contained in the proxy endorsement does not cease to be in effect by the death of the principal or his loss of legal capacity. If the bill of exchange contains the phrase "value pledged as security" or "value pledged as mortgage" or any other phrase implying a mortgage, the holder may exercise all the rights arising from the bill of exchange, but if he obtains an endorsement, his endorsement is only by way of procuration.

The obligors may not oppose the holder by means of objections based on their personal relationship with the endorser, unless the holder intended to harm the debtor when he received the bill of exchange.
