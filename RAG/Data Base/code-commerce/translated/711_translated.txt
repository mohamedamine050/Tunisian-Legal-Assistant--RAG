It is permissible to pledge movable assets to secure the performance of any type of obligation, even if the debt includes a sum of money and the amount due is not specified. It is also permissible to pledge real estate to secure the performance of obligations.

A formal mortgage is a contract by which the creditor acquires a real right on a property dedicated to the fulfillment of his debt, giving him the right to take precedence over ordinary creditors and creditors who rank lower than him in the order of payment, in the recovery of his right from the sale proceeds of that property, regardless of who holds it.

This method can be used to secure the performance of potential obligations at the time of the mortgage's establishment.
