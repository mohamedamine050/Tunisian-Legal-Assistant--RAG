In the event of the debtor's bankruptcy without going through or completing the judicial settlement procedures, the Court shall determine in its bankruptcy judgment the date of cessation of payment, which shall not exceed eighteen months prior to the date of the bankruptcy judgment or the date of filing the judicial settlement request, if applicable. In the event of silence on the date, the date of the judgment or the date of filing the request, as the case may be, shall be adopted.

However, the commencement date of the period of suspicion may be determined by one or more judgments issued by the Court based on the report of the delegated judge, either on its own motion or at the request of any interested party, particularly the creditors who may individually file such a request.

The aforementioned request shall not be admissible after the deadline stipulated in Article 534 of this Code. Upon expiry of the said deadline, the determined date of cessation of payment shall become non-reviewable against the creditors.
