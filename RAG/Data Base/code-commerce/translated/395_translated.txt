Except for bearer checks, it is permissible to issue a check in multiple counterparts, if it is drawn on a Tunisian bank and payable in another country, or vice versa.  If the check is issued in multiple counterparts, the numbers of these counterparts must be mentioned in the body of the check itself. Otherwise, each counterpart shall be considered as a separate and distinct check.
