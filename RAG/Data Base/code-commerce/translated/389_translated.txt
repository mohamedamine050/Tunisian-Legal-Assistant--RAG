The drawer or any endorser may exempt the holder from the obligation to make a recourse claim by writing on the check a condition of recourse "without expenses" or "without protest" or any similar condition and signed by them.

This condition does not exempt the holder from presenting the check within the prescribed period or from carrying out the necessary formalities, and it is upon whoever opposes the holder on the grounds of non-compliance with this period to prove this. If the drawer has written this condition, its consequences apply to all signatories. However, if one of the endorsers has written it, then the consequences it creates are limited to him. If the holder makes a claim for recourse despite the condition written by the drawer, then he alone bears the expenses. However, if the condition is issued by one of the endorsers, then the expenses of the claim, should it be made, can be recovered from all signatories.
