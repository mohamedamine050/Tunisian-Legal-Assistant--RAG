The seller may reclaim goods sent to the debtor to exercise the right of retention, as long as they have not been delivered to the debtor's warehouse or to a place at his disposal, according to appearances, or to a warehouse of a customer entrusted with selling them on the debtor's behalf.

However, the seller may not bring an action to recover the goods if the debtor has already sold them, without fraud on his part, to another good faith purchaser before their arrival.
