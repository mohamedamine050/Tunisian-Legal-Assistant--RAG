In no case whatsoever may the holder of bonds, under the dual procedure established for him in the preceding section, collect a lump sum exceeding the amount determined by the balance sheet confirming his debt against his debtor after the bonds have been entered against the corresponding heading.  This results in his right to share with the creditors of the bankrupt bond issuer being legally reduced in proportion to the amount he has collected from the obligors therein. However, if the balance sheet at the date of bankruptcy shows a balance confirming a debt against the bond issuer arising before the bonds were entered against the corresponding heading, the holder shall not be permitted to collect, under the dual procedure established for him in the preceding section, a lump sum exceeding the value of the bonds entered against the corresponding heading by the amount of the share allocated to him in the distribution, calculated on the basis of the balance confirming his debt against the issuer before the bonds were entered against the corresponding heading. This results in his right to share with the creditors of the bankrupt bond issuer being legally reduced in proportion to the amount he has collected from the obligors therein.
