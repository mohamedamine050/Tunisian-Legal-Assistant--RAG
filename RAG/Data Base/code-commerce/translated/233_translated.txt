The court where the original commercial document is filed may declare, upon the conclusion of a lease contract, the redemption of debts owed by the lessee due to his exploitation, if it deems that the redemption poses a risk to the lessor.

The action in this matter must be brought within three months from the date of the publication of the lease contract in the Official Gazette of the Tunisian Republic, otherwise the right to bring such action shall lapse upon the expiry of this period.
