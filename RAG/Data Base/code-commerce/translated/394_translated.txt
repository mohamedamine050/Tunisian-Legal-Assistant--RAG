If any obstacle prevents the presentation of the cheque or the filing of a protest within the prescribed timeframes, due to a reason beyond the holder's control, such as a provision of law or any other circumstance constituting force majeure, the aforementioned timeframes shall be extended.

The holder must immediately notify the payee of the occurrence of the force majeure event, and this notification must be included on the cheque or on a separate sheet attached to it, dated and signed by the holder.  Furthermore, the provisions of Article 388 shall apply to the remaining procedures.

Following the cessation of the force majeure event, the holder must promptly present the cheque for payment and then file a protest, if necessary. If the force majeure event persists for more than fifteen days from the date the holder notified the payee of its occurrence, even if this date precedes the expiry of the deadline for presenting the cheque, the holder may file a claim for recourse without needing to present the cheque or file a protest, unless such claim is suspended for a longer period by virtue of a legal provision. Acts solely attributable to the holder or to those he has entrusted with the presentation of the cheque or the filing of a protest shall not be considered as force majeure.
