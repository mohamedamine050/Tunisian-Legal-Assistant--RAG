Creditors are required to register their previous debts in order to initiate judicial settlement proceedings within thirty days from the date of publication in the Official Gazette of the Tunisian Republic, and sixty days for creditors residing outside Tunisian territory. The registration of a debt after this deadline will only be accepted with the authorization of the Committee of Scrutiny. In all cases, the registration of any debt will not be accepted after one year.

However, the following debts may be registered:

* **Tax debts**
* **Social security receivables of the National Social Security Fund** outside the one-year deadline stipulated in the preceding paragraph. However, they must be registered within a maximum of two months from the date of determining the amount of the debt.
* **Claims arising from current account contracts**, with the court responsible for the settlement being informed of the balance of the provisional account generated by the account on the date of opening the monitoring period within the deadline stipulated in the first paragraph of this chapter.

Failure to comply with the deadlines stipulated in the above paragraphs will result in the creditor being excluded from the distribution of funds in the framework of the rescue plan.

The court will approve the registration of all established debts in accordance with their order of priority and will decide to close the debt register. If a **dispute** arises regarding the origin or amount of the debt and **supporting documents** exist that make it more likely to be established, the court will authorize its provisional registration. The corresponding amounts will be secured at the time of distribution. If the debt is not supported by documentation, its registration will be rejected, but the creditor's right to claim remains preserved without affecting the course of the settlement proceedings.
