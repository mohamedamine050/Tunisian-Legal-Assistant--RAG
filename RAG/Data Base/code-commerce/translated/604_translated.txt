The client's privilege remains in place over the goods in his possession even if his debt is not related to them.

The client is considered to be in possession of the goods:

1) If they are at his disposal, whether in a warehouse, a public storage facility, or in his own warehouses, or if he is directly transporting them using his own means.

2) If he receives a bill of lading or other similar transport documents prior to their arrival.

3) If he receives a bill of lading or other similar transport documents after they have been shipped.
