In the event that creditors fail to present their debt claims within the stipulated deadlines, known or unknown creditors who were absent from the proceedings shall not participate in the distribution of the assets. However, they retain the right to object to this distribution until its completion through the procedure of _'aqala_.

_'Aqala_ is a legal procedure that allows a creditor holding an executory instrument to place the movable assets in the possession of their debtor under judicial custody. The expenses of the objection shall be borne by the objecting creditors.

Their objection shall not impede the execution of the distributions ordered by the appointed judge. However, if the judge proceeds with new distributions before ruling on their objection, the distribution shall be inclusive of the objecting creditors to the extent of the amount provisionally determined by the court. This amount shall be held pending a final decision on the objection.

If these creditors are subsequently recognized as creditors, they shall not be entitled to claim any part of the distributions ordered by the appointed judge. However, they have the right to receive their proportionate share of the remaining funds, without receiving the corresponding share of their debts in the initial distributions.

The provisions of the preceding paragraphs shall not apply to the creditor initiating the bankruptcy proceedings or to creditors who have previously declared their debts within the framework of the settlement procedures stipulated in the first chapter of this book, unless the amount of their debts has changed by way of increase or decrease.
