If some of the debts owed to one party consist of sums of money that are not of the same kind as the other debts or of non-fungible items in their entirety, the parties may include them in the current account subject to two conditions. Firstly, the payments corresponding to them must be evidenced in separate sections, with only fungible funds being included therein, as required. Secondly, it must be stipulated that the current account maintains its unity despite its physical division into multiple sections. In such cases, all balances arising from these different sections must be convertible to a single kind for aggregation, at any time designated by the parties, or at the latest when the current account is closed, so that only a single balance remains at the end.
