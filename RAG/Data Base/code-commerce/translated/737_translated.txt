Debts incurred by either party, when included in a current account, are no longer subject to the specific rules governing their statute of limitations and interest accrual. The rules of law regarding the extinguishment of rights by lapse of time apply to the balance after the account is closed.

Payments generate interest at the rate agreed upon by the parties, or, if none is specified, at the rate established by custom. The aforementioned interest, in turn, generates further interest from the date it is entered into the account, provided that such entry complies with the timeframes customary for the account, until the account is closed, unless otherwise stipulated.
