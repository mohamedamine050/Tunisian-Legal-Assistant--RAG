Within eight days following the filing of the aforementioned list, the Court shall notify the creditors by registered letters with acknowledgment of receipt at their designated addresses, as specified by them, of the account statements and shall notify the seller and the buyer at their respective addresses as specified in the sales contract, that they have a fifteen-day period to review the Court's written list, without any costs, the distribution list, the account statements, and the accompanying documents, and to present any objections they may have to the proposed distribution.

Objections shall be included at the bottom of the distribution list and shall be signed by their holders or their representatives. Every creditor may, at their own expense, obtain a copy or summary of the distribution list, the account statements, and the accompanying documents, or the report of the appointed judge mentioned in Article 265. Upon expiry of the fifteen-day period, if no objection is raised by any of the creditor-claimants for the account statements, or by the seller or the buyer, the settlement shall become final by law, even if the seller is absent.

Court costs shall be charged preferentially, and the judge shall order the cancellation of the liens and objections against the amounts intended for distribution, and shall also authorize the delivery of the account statements to the interested creditors who must be summoned by the Court clerk to receive their share. If there is an objection, a provisional settlement may be drawn up by means of a partial distribution in favor of one of the creditors, if they have priority over others, and if there is no dispute regarding their ranking in the order or the amount of their debt, even if there is an objection.
