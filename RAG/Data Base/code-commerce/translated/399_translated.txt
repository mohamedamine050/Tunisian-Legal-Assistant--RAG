The period prescribed for the extinction of a right by lapse of time shall only begin to run from the date of the last judicial act, and shall not apply if judgment is given for payment or recognition of the debt by an independent legal document. 

The interruption of the period of extinction by lapse of time shall only have effect in relation to the person against whom the interrupting act was performed. However, the defendant in the debt action must prove by oath that nothing remains due to them. Likewise, their heirs or successors must swear an oath to the effect that they believe in good faith that nothing remains due from the debt.
