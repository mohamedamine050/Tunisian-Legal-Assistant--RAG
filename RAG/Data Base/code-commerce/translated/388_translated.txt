The holder of the check shall notify the drawer and the drawee of the refusal to pay within four business days following the date of lodging the protest or the date of presentation if it includes a condition of return without charges. If the check includes the name and address of the drawee, the judicial officers shall, within forty-eight hours of registering the protest, inform him of the reasons for refusing payment by registered letter with acknowledgment of receipt and notice of delivery, failing which they shall be liable for damages. Each drawer shall inform the drawer of the notification he received within two business days following the day of receipt of the notification and shall indicate to him the names and addresses of those who issued the previous notifications. This procedure shall be followed from drawer to drawer until it reaches the drawee. The aforementioned deadlines shall begin from the date of receipt of the previous notification.

If any of the drawers does not indicate his address or writes in an illegible manner, the notification may be limited to the previous drawer.

It is permissible for the person who is required to give notice to do so in any way he sees fit, but he shall be required to prove that he has done so within the time limit specified.

Anyone who neglects to give notice within the time limit specified above shall not lose his right due to its lapse, but he shall be liable, where appropriate, to compensate for the damages resulting from his negligence, provided that this compensation shall not exceed the amount of the check.
