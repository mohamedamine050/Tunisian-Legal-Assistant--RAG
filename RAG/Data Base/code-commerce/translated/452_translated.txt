The Judicial Administrator shall examine the rescue plan submitted by the debtor and modify it if necessary. The rescue plan shall include means of revitalizing the enterprise, including, if necessary, scheduling its debts, the percentage of reduction from their principal or the interest accrued thereon, changing the legal form of the enterprise, increasing its capital, and preserving employment therein.

The Judicial Administrator shall consult with the representatives of the creditors and shall compulsorily take into account the creditors' opinion on the reduction of their principal. He may also seek the opinion of the Economic Enterprises Monitoring Committee. If the plan requires the termination of employment contracts or a reduction in wages and benefits, the Judicial Administrator shall inform the Labor Inspectorate. He shall await thirty days for the outcome of the conciliation efforts before referring the plan to the supervising judge.

The Judicial Administrator shall compulsorily submit the rescue plan, as submitted by the debtor or as modified, to the supervising judge immediately upon finalizing his opinion thereon, without exceeding the deadline provided for in Article 439 of this Code. The supervising judge shall prepare a report setting out the feasibility of the plan and shall submit it to the court within fifteen days. He may propose placing the enterprise under liquidation if its conditions are met.
