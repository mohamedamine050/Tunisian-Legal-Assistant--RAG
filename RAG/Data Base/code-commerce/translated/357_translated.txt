**English Translation:**

Anyone who signs a check on behalf of another person without being authorized to do so by a power of attorney shall be personally bound by the check. If such a person makes payment, they shall have the same rights as the person who claimed to be their representative. This ruling also applies to an agent who exceeds the scope of their authority.
