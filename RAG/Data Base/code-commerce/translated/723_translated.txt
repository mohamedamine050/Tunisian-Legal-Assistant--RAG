A revocable letter of credit shall not be binding on the bank in relation to the beneficiary. The bank may modify or revoke it at any time, either at its own discretion or at the request of its client, without the need to notify the beneficiary. Provided that the right to modify or revoke shall not be exercised in bad faith or at an inappropriate time.
