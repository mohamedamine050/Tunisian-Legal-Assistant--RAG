The Secretary, with the authorization of the designated judge and after summoning the debtor by registered mail with notification of the conciliation, may propose conciliation in all disputes concerning the rights of creditors, including those relating to real property rights. The conciliation is subject to the court's approval, which summons the debtor to attend and sign. The debtor may object to signing if the subject matter relates to real property rights.

[1] Conciliation is an agreement that aims to resolve a dispute and end litigation. This is achieved through mutual concessions by the parties, such as relinquishing part of their claims, or by the delivery of money or rights. [2] Conciliation is an agreement by which the parties terminate an existing dispute or prevent a potential dispute, through a mutual exchange of concessions.

The acts that require a waiver, concession, or compliance with rulings are subject to the rules previously outlined in the case of authorization or signing.
