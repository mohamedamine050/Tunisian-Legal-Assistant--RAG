If the bill of exchange is accepted by several obligors whose domiciles are at the place of payment, or if it designates persons whose domiciles are at the same place of payment when needed, then the holder must present the bill of exchange to all these persons and, if applicable, raise a protest for non-payment against the majority on the day following the day on which the protest can be raised.

If no protest is lodged within the aforementioned deadline, then the person designated, when needed, to make payment, or the person for whose benefit the bill of exchange was accepted, and their respective successors, shall be released from their obligations.
