The holder is obliged to send a notice of non-acceptance or non-payment to the drawer within four business days following the day of protest or the day of presentation, in the form of a registered return receipt without expenses.

The executing notaries, if the bill of exchange includes the name and address of the drawer, shall notify him within forty-eight hours of recording the protest of the reasons for refusal to pay, by registered mail with notification of delivery, otherwise they shall be liable for damages.

Each endorser, within three business days following the day the notice reaches him, shall notify the endorsee of the notice he has received and shall, moreover, inform him of the names and addresses of those to whom prior notices were sent. This process shall be followed consecutively until reaching the drawer, and the aforementioned deadlines shall commence from the date of receipt of the prior notice.

If a notice is sent to one of the endorsers of the bill of exchange pursuant to the preceding paragraph, the same notice shall be sent to his guarantor within the same deadline.

If one of the endorsers does not indicate his address or writes it illegibly, it shall suffice to send the notice to the endorser preceding him. Whoever is obliged to send a notice may do so by any means whatsoever, even if it merely involves returning the bill of exchange.

He must prove that he sent the notice within the specified deadline.

The deadline shall be deemed to have been observed if the letter containing the notice is delivered to the post office within the aforementioned deadline.

Whoever does not send the notice within the specified deadline shall not be subject to any form of appeal, although he may be held liable, if necessary, for the damages arising from his negligence, but without exceeding the amount of the bill of exchange.
