If the payment of the check is stipulated in non-Tunisian dinar currency, then its amount can be paid within the period of presentation of the check for payment, based on its value in dinars on the day of payment. If payment is not made on the day of presentation, the holder has the option of demanding the amount of the check valued in dinars, based on the prevailing rate on the day of presentation or on the day of payment.  The Tunisian custom must be followed in determining the value of different foreign currencies in which checks are issued, in order to assess them in dinars, although the drawer may stipulate the account of the amount to be paid according to a specific exchange rate on the check.

These rules do not apply if the drawer stipulates that payment must be made in a specific type of currency, which is a case of stipulating actual payment in foreign currency.

If the amount of the check is determined in currency that is identical in name, but its value in the country of issuance differs from its value in the country of payment, the matter is subject to the presumption of using the currency prevailing in the country where payment is made.
