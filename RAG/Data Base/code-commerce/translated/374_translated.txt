## English Translation:

**(Amended by Law No. 28 of 1996 dated April 3, 1996 and by Law No. 37 of 2007 dated June 4, 2007.)** - The drawee bank is obligated to pay even after the presentation period has expired. The drawer is not entitled to oppose payment of the check except in case of loss, theft, or bankruptcy of the holder.

**Objection** is a remedy available to the defaulting party to overturn a decision made in their absence.

The drawer may object to payment for reasons other than those stipulated in the first paragraph. In such cases, the **Urgent Judge** – a court characterized by its speed and simplified procedures in contrast to the substantive court, which is characterized by complex rules and lengthy procedures – may authorize the cancellation of the objection upon request by the holder, even if the holder has initiated a substantive lawsuit.

The bank is obligated to pay any check drawn on it by a bank draft issued to the drawer, even if the account balance is zero or insufficient, provided the amount of the check does not exceed twenty dinars. The provisions of the preceding paragraph do not apply to checks drawn on accounts opened in foreign currency or in convertible dinars.

The obligation to pay expires one month after the expiry of the period stipulated in Article 372 of this Code. This obligation does not apply to the bank if its refusal to pay the check is justified by a reason other than an insufficient or zero balance.

By virtue of such payment, the bank is legally substituted for the beneficiary in all their rights against the drawer of the check, up to the amount paid. The bank has the right to recover the amount it has paid by directly deducting it from the drawer's account.
