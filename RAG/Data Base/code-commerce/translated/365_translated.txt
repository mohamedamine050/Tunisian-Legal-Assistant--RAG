Any check that is subject to endorsement is considered to be legally held by its bearer when the bearer proves their right to it through an unbroken chain of endorsements, even if the last endorsement is on blank paper. Endorsements made on such a check, regardless of being crossed or not, are considered as non-existent. If a blank endorsement is followed by another endorsement, then the party signing on that subsequent endorsement is considered to have acquired ownership of the check through the blank endorsement.
