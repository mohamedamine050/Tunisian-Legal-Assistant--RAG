All claims arising from a bill of exchange and directed against the holder thereof shall lapse after three years from the date of maturity of payment. Claims of the holder against the drawer and the endorser shall lapse after one year from the date of the protest drawn up within the legal time limit or from the date of maturity if the bill of exchange contains a clause for return without charges.  

The claims of the drawers against each other or against the endorser shall lapse after six months from the day on which the drawer paid the bill of exchange or from the day on which they bring the claim.

The lapse of time shall not run in case of the bringing of an action except from the last judicial act. The lapse of time shall not apply if a judgment for payment has been issued or if the debt has been acknowledged in a separate instrument. 

The interruption of the period shall have effect only against the person to whom the act of interruption was directed. However, the parties sued for the debt shall, when required, be bound to take an oath on the clearance of their liability.  Their heirs or successors shall be bound to take an oath on the belief in good faith that there remains no part of the debt.
