The contract stipulating the deposit of funds does not entail the right to dispose of any amount exceeding the disclosed deposit. However, if the bank permits one or more transactions that result in a remaining balance in the depositor's account, the bank must notify the depositor thereof so that the depositor is obligated to settle the account without delay.
