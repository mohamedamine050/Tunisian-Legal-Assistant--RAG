All persons bound pursuant to a bill of exchange are jointly and severally liable.

The holder has the right to demand payment from these persons individually or collectively, without being obliged to respect the order of their obligations.

Any person who has signed a bill of exchange and has paid its value is entitled to this right.

An action brought against one of the obligors does not preclude the holder from demanding payment from the others, even if they are subsequent obligors to the person who was initially sued.
