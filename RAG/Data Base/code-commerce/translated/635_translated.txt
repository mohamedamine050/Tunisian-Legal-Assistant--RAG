If the nature of the object necessitates its packaging, the sender is obligated to package it in a manner that protects it from loss and damage and prevents harm to persons, equipment, and other movable objects that could result in damage. 

The sender is responsible for any damages that occur due to the failure to properly package the movable objects. However, the carrier is responsible for any damages that occur due to the failure to properly package or leave the aforementioned objects unpacked if the carrier accepted the transportation while aware of the improper packaging or complete negligence.

[1] Harm that occurs in violation of the law affecting a person's body, mental or psychological health, reputation, property, or honor. [2] Loss or damage to property, deprivation of comfort, or harm to physical well-being, reputation, or the like. â€“ Damage in crimes and quasi-crimes refers to the actual loss suffered by the claimant and the necessary expenses that he was or will be forced to incur to repair the consequences of the act that caused him harm, as well as what he has been deprived of in the ordinary scope of the consequences of this act.

The failure to properly package the movable object does not absolve the carrier from the obligations incumbent upon him under other transportation contracts.
