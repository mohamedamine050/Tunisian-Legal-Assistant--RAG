If one of the creditors has already initiated proceedings for the seizure of the debtor's movable assets, pursuant to a writ of execution, placing them under the authority of the court, before the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings, the trustee in bankruptcy shall complete these procedures from the last step. The assigned judge may authorize the trustee to resume all or some of the procedures.

The trustee is obliged to complete the sale within three months with the permission of the assigned judge, following the procedures stipulated in the Code of Civil Procedure and Commercial Procedure.

However, as an exception to the provisions of Article 425 of the Code of Civil Procedure and Commercial Procedure, the court continues to reduce the price, even in the sale of immovable property subject to pre-emptive rights, unless it exceeds or falls short of the agreed price between the parties.

Seizure, sale by public auction, and sale through sealed bids result in the property being purged of privileges, mortgages, and other encumbrances, except for easements.
