The payee has the right to demand from the holder upon payment of the check, that the check be delivered to him with an endorsement indicating the payment.

The holder cannot refuse partial payment.

If the balance is less than the amount of the check, the holder has the right to demand payment up to the amount of the balance. In the case of partial payment, the payee has the right to demand a notation of this payment on the check and to be given a receipt for it.

This receipt, attached to a separate document from the check, is exempt from stamp duty, like the receipt attached to the check itself. The drawer and endorsers are discharged from liability to the extent of the partial payment from the original amount of the check.

The holder is required to issue a protest for non-payment of the remaining amount.
