The trustee, after obtaining authorization from the assigned judge, may request the delivery of the goods upon payment of the price agreed upon by the contracting parties, unless the price exceeds or falls short of the value of the goods agreed upon by the seller. This applies in cases where the seller exercises the right of retention.
