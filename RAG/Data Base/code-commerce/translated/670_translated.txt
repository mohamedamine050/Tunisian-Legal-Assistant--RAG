The contract requiring the deposit of funds shall, by virtue thereof, make the bank the owner of the said funds, obligated to return them in accordance with the rules hereinafter set forth.

All funds received by the bank, whether subject to an interest rate or not, shall be considered as deposited, regardless of the method of delivery, from any individual the bank requests to deposit funds with it, or at the request of the depositor. The bank shall have the right to use such funds for the purposes of its business operations, provided that it ensures the depositor’s continued access to their funds, particularly for the purpose of paying any orders received by the bank, involving the use of the depositor’s funds, whether through checks, transfer authorizations, or any other means used for the benefit of the depositor or any third party, or for the purpose of collecting any funds received by the bank on the depositor’s account, by mutual agreement or according to customary practice, and adding them to the deposited funds.

The above ruling concerning funds deposited shall apply to cash amounts for which the bank issues a receipt or authorization to receive the funds for a fixed term, regardless of whether it is accompanied by an interest certificate.
