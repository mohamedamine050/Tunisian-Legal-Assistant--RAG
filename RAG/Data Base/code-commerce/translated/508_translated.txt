The court, in the judgment issued in bankruptcy, shall order the placing of seals. These measures may be taken at any time at the request of the trustee. 

The assigned judge shall place the seals, and may delegate their placement to the judge of the district where the debtor's principal place of business is located. If the assigned judge considers that the debtor's assets can be inventoried in one day, the seals shall not be placed, and the inventory shall be commenced immediately.
