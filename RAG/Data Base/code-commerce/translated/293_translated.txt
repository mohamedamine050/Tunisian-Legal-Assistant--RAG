If a bill of exchange is drawn for payment on a specific date in a country whose calendar differs from the calendar of the place where the bill was drawn, then the due date is determined according to the calendar adopted in the place of payment.  And if the bill of exchange is drawn between two countries with different calendars for payment on a specific date, then the date of its drawing is referred to the corresponding date in the calendar of the place of payment, and the due date is determined accordingly.

The specified periods for presenting the bill of exchange are calculated according to the rules outlined in the previous paragraph. However, these rules do not apply if the text of the bill of exchange includes a condition or merely statements indicating an intention to follow different rules.
