During the monitoring period, which shall not exceed twelve months in all cases, all executive actions aimed at recovering pre-monitoring debts or recovering movable or immovable property due to non-payment of debt shall be suspended. During the same period, the application of all interest and late payment penalties shall be suspended, and statutes of limitation shall be suspended. The suspension of enforcement proceedings and statutes of limitation shall be automatically lifted upon the expiry of the monitoring period and in all cases within the maximum period mentioned above.

The President of the Court may suspend enforcement proceedings against the guarantor, surety, or joint debtor.

However, enforcement proceedings shall not be suspended, the application of all interest and late payment penalties shall not be suspended, and statutes of limitation shall not be suspended, if a settlement request is submitted by one of the creditors and the debtor fails to provide all the required documents without a valid reason. The President of the Court shall declare this in the decision to open the monitoring period. If the documents are provided, the President of the Court shall verify that the condition is met and shall immediately declare the suspension of enforcement proceedings, the cessation of the application of all interest and late payment penalties, and the suspension of statutes of limitation.

A judgment relating to employee benefits shall not be enforced except with the authorization of the President of the Court, provided that enforcement does not lead to the prevention of the rescue of the enterprise. This excludes amounts that are not subject to seizure from employee benefits.

The suspension of the payment of an installment of a debt during the monitoring period shall not result in the maturity of the remaining installments, regardless of any contrary agreement.

The opening of the monitoring period shall result in the suspension of attachment proceedings against assets in the stage they have reached, and the Court responsible for the attachment shall file the file with its records. The suspension shall be automatically lifted upon the judgment rejecting the settlement request. If the judgment is to continue the activity, or to transfer the enterprise, or to lease it, or to lease it with transfer, or to assign it to a third party under a free agency, the attachment shall be automatically lifted.

The suspension provided for in the first paragraph of this chapter shall not include debts whose maturity date falls within the monitoring period, even if they arose before the opening of the monitoring period.
