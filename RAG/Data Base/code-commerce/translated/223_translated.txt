If the seller, upon the sale, stipulated the termination of the contract for failure to pay the price within the agreed upon time, or if the seller and the buyer agreed on the termination of the sale, the seller must notify the creditors, through an executing judge, and at their chosen location, of the termination occurring pursuant to the condition or agreement. This termination shall not be final until one month has passed from the date of this notification.
