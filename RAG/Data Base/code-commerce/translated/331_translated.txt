If one of the counterparts for acceptance is required, the party must specify the name of the person in possession of the other counterpart. This person must deliver the counterpart to the legal holder of the other counterpart. 

If this person refuses to deliver the counterpart, the holder cannot file a claim for return unless they can prove by evidence: 

1. That the counterpart intended for acceptance was not delivered to them upon request.
2. That the acceptance or performance was not obtained based on another counterpart.
