If the debtor fails to fulfill his obligations arising from the amicable settlement agreement towards one of his creditors, any interested party may request the court to rescind the agreement, cancel the deadlines granted to the debtor, and restore the parties to the situation they were in with respect to the unpaid debts.

The request for rescission shall be filed and adjudicated by the competent court in accordance with the procedures of summary proceedings.
