The priority of creditors or the substitution of some for others is established by a handwritten document registered in accordance with the law. 

The clerk may not make a partial or total erasure unless authorized by the judge, except after the submission of an official document or a handwritten document registered in accordance with the law that proves the consent of the creditor or the person entitled to the debt in the legal manner, provided that their right to it is proven.

Total or partial erasure is obtained when it is registered in the register of the administration belonging to the Commercial Property Authority in accordance with Article 208, after submitting a certificate of erasure, which is delivered by the clerk of the Court of First Instance.
