The registration of the sale must be carried out within fifteen days from the date of its contract, otherwise it shall be void. This deadline applies even in the event of a bankruptcy ruling.

Any party with an interest, including the debtor himself, may invoke this nullity. If the registration is carried out in the prescribed manner, it shall have priority over any other registration whose cause is related to the purchaser. This registration can be invoked against the purchaser's bankruptcy.
