If a commercial agency is not limited by a specific term, neither party may terminate this contract without prior notice. 

**Notice** is a unilateral legal act, a verbal or written reminder addressed to an employee by their direct supervisor. It indicates the violation committed and demands adherence to regulations and rules.

However, termination is permissible if the notice period established by custom is not respected, or in the event of a fault by one of the parties.
