Acceptance by way of intervention may be obtained in all cases where the holder of the bill of exchange to be accepted has a right of recourse before maturity.

If the bill of exchange designates a person for its acceptance or payment, if necessary, at the place of performance, the holder cannot exercise a right of recourse before maturity against the drawer or subsequent endorsers, unless the bill was presented to the designated person and they refused to accept it, and this refusal is proven by a protest.

In other circumstances of intervention, the holder may refuse acceptance by way of intervention. However, if they accept the intervention in the manner presented, they cannot, before maturity, exercise their right of recourse against the person for whose benefit acceptance was made or subsequent endorsers.

Acceptance by way of intervention must be noted on the bill of exchange and signed by the intervenor. It must also specify the person for whose benefit it was made. If this specification is omitted, the acceptance in this manner shall be considered to be made for the benefit of the drawer.

Acceptance by way of intervention is binding upon the holder and the guarantors bound to the drawer for whose benefit the intervention was made in the manner in which they are bound. Despite acceptance by way of intervention, the person for whose benefit it was made or their guarantors may, in return for their payment of the amount specified in Article 311, demand that the holder deliver the bill of exchange and the protest, and, if applicable, a receipt upon payment.
