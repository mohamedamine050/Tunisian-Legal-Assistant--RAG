If the check, whose payment is mandatory, is made payable to a designated person with an explicit condition "to order" or without such condition, it is transferable by way of endorsement. 

However, the check whose payment is conditioned upon its being made payable to a designated person with a condition "not to order," or with a similar condition, is not transferable except in accordance with the conditions stipulated for ordinary assignment and subject to the consequences arising therefrom.
