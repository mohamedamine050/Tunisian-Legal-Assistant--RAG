In the deliberations of bankruptcy, any creditor who does not raise a claim except for their right to a privilege or mortgage is accepted as an ordinary creditor. 

A formal mortgage is a contract by which the creditor acquires a real right over a property designated for the payment of their debt. This right entitles the creditor to take precedence over ordinary creditors and creditors ranking after them in the order of payment, in satisfying their claim from the sale price of that property, regardless of who holds it. 

The claim, however, remains subject to the outcome of the dispute.
