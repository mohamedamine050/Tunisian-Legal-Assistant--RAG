If the creditor has obligations from the debtor and other obligors with him in a joint and several manner, and he has collected a portion of his debt before the bankruptcy, he shall not participate with the creditors except to the extent of the remaining balance of his debt. He shall retain his rights against the co-debtors or guarantors for the remaining amount.

The co-debtor or guarantor shall be included among the creditors if one of them pays a portion of the debt equivalent to the amount he paid on behalf of the debtor.
