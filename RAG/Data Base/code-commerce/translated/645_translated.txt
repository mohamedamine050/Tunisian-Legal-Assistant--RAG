If a dispute arises regarding the formation, execution, or occurrence of an incident during the execution of a contract of carriage, one or more experts shall be appointed to investigate and examine the condition of the goods being transported or to be transported, particularly if it is necessary to determine how they are to be packaged, their weight, and their type. 

These experts shall be appointed by a court order upon a petition. 

The plaintiff shall be responsible for inviting all parties who are expected to be involved in the case to attend the examination, by registered mail or telegram, specifically the sender, the recipient, the carrier, and the intermediary agent. However, the plaintiff may be exempted, in whole or in part, from complying with the procedures set forth in this paragraph, pursuant to a specific authorization granted in the aforementioned court order.

The court may order the deposit or seizure of the disputed goods, followed by their transfer to a public warehouse.

The court may authorize the sale of the goods, to the extent that the proceeds from the sale cover the costs of carriage and other preceding expenses. The judge shall decide to whom the proceeds from the sale are to be paid, among the parties who have advanced those expenses.
