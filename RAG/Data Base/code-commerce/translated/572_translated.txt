If the assignment, lease, or bankruptcy includes assets subject to a special privilege or a mortgage on movable or immovable property, then the priority right arising from the special privilege or mortgage shall apply to the proportion represented by the value of the said movable or immovable property compared to the total assignment price, the total lease price, or the total liquidation value, as the case may be. This proportion shall be determined by reference to the accounting records and, if necessary, by a valuation authorized by the court responsible for the distribution.
