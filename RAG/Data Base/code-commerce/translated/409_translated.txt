(Amended by Law No. 82 of 1985 dated August 11, 1985)

Whoever issues a check without specifying the place of issuance or its date, or who puts a forged date on it, and whoever draws a check on a person other than a bank, shall be punished by a fine of six percent (6%) of the amount of the check, provided that this fine shall not be less than one dinar.

The first presenter or holder of the check shall be personally obligated to pay the same fine, without having the right to recourse against anyone, if the check is devoid of a statement of the place of issuance or the date, or if it contains a date later than the date of its presentation or presentation, as required. The aforementioned fine shall be incurred by anyone who pays or delivers a check by way of clearing that does not include a statement of the place of issuance or its date.

All this, without prejudice to other penalties that must be applied in accordance with Articles 411 and subsequent articles of this Code.
