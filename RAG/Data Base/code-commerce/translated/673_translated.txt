The account relating to the deposit of funds requires that payment be made from it upon presentation and that its owner has the right to dispose of the entire balance or any part thereof at any time, unless a condition dictates otherwise.

The right to dispose of the entire balance or any part thereof may be subject to the observance of a period commencing from the issuance of a notification or to the occurrence of a specific date. 

A notification is a unilateral legal act; it is a verbal or written reminder addressed to an employee by their immediate supervisor, indicating the infringement committed and requesting them to comply with the rules and regulations.
