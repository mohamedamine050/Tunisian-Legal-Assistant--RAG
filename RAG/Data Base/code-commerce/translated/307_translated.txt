## English Translation: 

**Refusal of Acceptance or Payment**

The refusal of acceptance or payment must be proven by a formal document, which is a written declaration of refusal of acceptance or refusal of payment. 

The declaration of refusal of acceptance must be made within the specified time limits for presenting the bill for acceptance. If the bill was first presented on the last day of the presentation period, as stipulated in the first paragraph of Article 284, the declaration may also be made on the following day. 

The declaration of refusal of payment of a bill payable on a specific date, or after a certain period from its date or the date of its presentation, must be made on one of the two business days following the due date for payment of the bill. If the bill is payable upon presentation, the declaration must be made according to the conditions mentioned in the preceding paragraph for making a declaration of refusal of acceptance.

**Effect of Declaration of Refusal of Acceptance**

A declaration of refusal of acceptance exempts the holder from presenting the bill for payment and from making a declaration of refusal of payment.

**Recourse Action**

If the drawee stops payment of his debts, whether or not he has accepted the bill, or if his estate is liquidated without any result, the holder cannot exercise a recourse action against the drawer unless he has presented the bill to the drawee for payment and made a declaration of refusal.

**Bankruptcy**

If the drawee is declared bankrupt, whether or not he has accepted the bill, or if the drawer of the bill is declared bankrupt and the bill is not accepted, the holder need not present the bill for acceptance and may rely on the bankruptcy judgment to exercise his recourse action.
