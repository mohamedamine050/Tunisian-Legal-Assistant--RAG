If the proceeds from the sale of real estate are distributed before the proceeds from the sale of movable property, or if both distributions occur simultaneously, the preferred creditors or mortgagees of the real estate who have not recovered their full debts from the proceeds of the real estate shall share in the proportion of the balance owed to them with the ordinary creditors in the distribution of the funds returned to the creditors, provided that their debts have been examined in accordance with the procedures previously determined.
