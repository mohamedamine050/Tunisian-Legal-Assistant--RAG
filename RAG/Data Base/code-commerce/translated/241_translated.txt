In the event of a transfer of the commercial principal, the debts secured by it shall become due and payable by operation of law, unless the owner of the commercial principal has sent registered letters with acknowledgment of receipt, notifying the secured creditors at their chosen addresses, at least fifteen days before the transfer, informing them of their intention to transfer the commercial principal and of the new location where they intend to establish it. The seller or the mortgagee must, within fifteen days of being notified or within fifteen days of becoming aware of the transfer, request the annotation on the margin of the registered record held by them of the new location to which the commercial principal was transferred. They must also, if the transfer is to another court jurisdiction, request the re-registration of their original registration at the date of its origin in the register of the court to which the transfer was made, stating their new location.

If the procedures stipulated in the preceding paragraph are neglected, the secured creditor's right of preference may be lost if it is proven that their negligence caused damage to non-contracting parties who were misled about the legal status of the commercial principal.

If the commercial principal is transferred without the consent of the seller or the mortgagee, the debts due to them may become due and payable if the transfer causes a decrease in the value of the commercial principal.

The registration of a mortgage may result in the maturity of the debts previously secured by it if they were incurred due to the use of the commercial principal.

Actions seeking the annulment of a term pursuant to the preceding two paragraphs shall be subject to the procedural rules set forth in paragraph eight of Article 243 hereafter.
