The institution of an action for rescission due to non-payment of the price shall be governed by Article 273 of the Code of Obligations and Contracts, unless the contract expressly provides otherwise. This action shall be limited, by its very nature, to the elements covered by the sale and may not be brought after the expiry of the period of limitation, except by the contracting parties.
