If the maturity date of a bill of exchange falls on an official holiday, payment cannot be demanded until the first working day following it. Similarly, all procedural actions related to the bill of exchange, particularly its presentation for acceptance and protest, cannot be performed except on working days.

If any of the aforementioned actions must be performed on a specific date that happens to fall on an official holiday, the deadline is extended to the first working day following it.  Holiday days falling within the deadline are counted towards its duration.
