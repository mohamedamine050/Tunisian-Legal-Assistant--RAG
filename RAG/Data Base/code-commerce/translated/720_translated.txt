A documentary credit is a credit opened by a bank at the request of a principal for the benefit of its client. It is secured by the possession of documents representing the goods during their transport or goods prepared for transport. The documentary credit arises independently from the contract of sale, which can be the origin of its formation, with the banks remaining external to it.  The contract is a legally binding agreement that obligates the contracting parties and defines their obligations and rights with respect to the specific transaction.
