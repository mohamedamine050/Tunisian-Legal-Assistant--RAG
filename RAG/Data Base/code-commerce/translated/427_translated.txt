Similarly, he cannot authorize the suspension of execution proceedings aimed at recovering movable or immovable property unless it is evident that they are necessary for the activity of the debtor establishment. However, he may authorize the suspension of the time limits for limitation.

The authorization shall specify the execution procedures authorized to be suspended.

The President of the Court shall not decide to suspend execution proceedings without first summoning the creditor, the guarantor, or the joint debtor, as per law, to hear their response.
