The owner of a lost or stolen bill of exchange, in order to obtain a second copy, is obligated to request from the last endorser before him that he provide the necessary assistance in his name and with due diligence to seek the previous endorser. The owner of the lost or stolen bill of exchange must follow the holder of the bill of exchange and bear the cost of this process from endorser to endorser until it reaches the bank.
