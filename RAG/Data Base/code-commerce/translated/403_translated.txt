The executing bailiffs shall keep a copy, conforming to the original, of the objections they raise. Failure to do so shall expose them to dismissal, and they shall be liable to pay damages and costs to the injured party. They must, under the same penalties, transmit two copies, conforming to the original, of the objections they raise, either by delivery to the clerk of the court in whose district the defendant's residence is located or by registered letter with acknowledgement of receipt.  One copy shall be transmitted to the Public Prosecutor's Office. This procedure must be completed within fifteen days of the drafting of the objection.
