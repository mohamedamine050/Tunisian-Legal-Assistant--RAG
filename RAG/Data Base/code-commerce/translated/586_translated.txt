Every creditor whose debt has been examined and approved, without holding an enforceable instrument and having the right to individual enforcement, may obtain the necessary enforceable instrument by means of a petition submitted to the President of the Court that ruled on the bankruptcy. The decision issued by the President of the Court shall include a statement of the final approval of the debt and an order to the debtor to pay it, and it shall be clothed by the Court Clerk with an enforceable form.
