If the debtor fails to fulfill his obligations, the creditor has the right to compel him to fulfill them by other legal means, except for the disposal of assets that the Court has temporarily prohibited disposal of, and he is not entitled to terminate the loan agreement. In this case, a request to revoke the rescue plan may be made by the Agent of the Republic, the Enforcement Officer, or by a creditor or creditors whose debt or debts amount to fifteen percent of the total debts. The effects of a partial or full waiver of any part of the debt or any guarantee shall cease by law if the plan is revoked.

The Court shall order the transfer of the institution to a third party in accordance with the procedures prescribed in the first section of the fourth division of this chapter if it is found possible to rescue it, or to bankruptcy if its conditions are met.
