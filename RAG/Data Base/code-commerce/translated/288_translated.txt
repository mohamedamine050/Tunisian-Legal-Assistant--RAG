If the drawee has placed his acceptance on the bill of exchange and then cancelled it before returning the bill, this is considered a refusal of acceptance. The cancellation, if proven to have occurred before returning the instrument, constitutes evidence of refusal, unless the contrary is proven.

However, if the drawee has notified the holder or any other place in writing of his acceptance, he becomes obligated to them for what was contained in the formula by which he expressed his acceptance.
