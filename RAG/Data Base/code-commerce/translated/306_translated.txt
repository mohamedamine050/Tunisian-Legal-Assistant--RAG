The holder may file a recourse action against the drawer, the drawee, and all other obligors:

- Upon maturity of the obligation;

- If payment is not received.

They may also do so prior to maturity:

-1 If there is a total or partial refusal of acceptance;

-2 If the drawee becomes insolvent, whether or not acceptance has been issued, or if they cease payment of their debts even if not proven by a court ruling, or from the date of the cessation of their business activities without justification;

-3 If the drawer of the bill of exchange, which does not require acceptance, becomes insolvent. However, the guarantors who are subject to a recourse action based on the guarantee in the circumstances outlined in the second and third paragraphs above, may, within three days of being served with the recourse action, submit a request to the presiding judge of the court in whose jurisdiction they reside, seeking an extension of time. If the request is justified, the judge will issue a decision setting the deadline by which the guarantors must pay the amount of the relevant commercial instruments, without exceeding the extended deadline of the specified maturity date. This decision is not subject to appeal.
