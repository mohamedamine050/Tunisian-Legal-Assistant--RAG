If the promissory note is subject to an obligation by minors who are not merchants, it shall be void as to them, without prejudice to the rights of each party pursuant to Article 13 of the Code of Obligations and Contracts. 

If the promissory note contains signatures of persons who are not legally competent to obligate themselves by it, or forged signatures, or signatures attributed to fictitious persons, or signatures which are not binding for any other reason, the signatories, this shall not preclude the other signatories from being bound by their obligations.

Anyone who signs a promissory note as a representative of a person who has not authorized him to do so shall be personally bound by this promissory note, and shall have the same rights as his alleged principal if he makes the payment, and the same rule applies to the agent who exceeds the scope of his agency.
