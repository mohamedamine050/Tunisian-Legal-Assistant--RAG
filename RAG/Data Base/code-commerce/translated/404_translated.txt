If the filing of the check or the lodging of a protest against it can only be done on a working day, and if the last day of the period granted by law for performing the actions relating to the check, particularly its presentation for payment or the drafting of a protest, falls on an official holiday, this period shall be extended until the first working day following its expiry.

As for the official holidays falling within the aforementioned period, they are included in its calculation.

Days that, pursuant to the laws in force, are not permitted for making any payment or filing any protest, are considered similar to official holidays.
