Bills of exchange payable after a certain period from the date of their presentation must be presented for signature by the drawer within the time limits specified in Article 283. The time period commencing after presentation runs from the date of signature by the drawer of the bill. If the drawer refuses to sign the bill with a date, such refusal must be established by a protest (Article 285), and the date of the protest shall be the commencement of the period for presentation.
