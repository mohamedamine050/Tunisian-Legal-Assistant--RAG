A person who performs the rights arising from the bill of exchange by way of intervention acquires the rights against the person who performed on his behalf and against those obligated to him pursuant to the bill of exchange, except that he shall not be permitted to re-present the bill of exchange and the subsequent endorsers who are subject to the place where the performance was made for his benefit shall be released from their obligation.

In the event of a conflict between multiple interveners for performance, preference shall be given to the intervener whose performance would release the greatest number of obligors. Any intervener acting in violation of this rule with knowledge of it shall not have the right to recourse against the obligors who would have been released if the performance had been made by the intervener with preference.
