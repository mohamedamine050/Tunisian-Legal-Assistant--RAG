Every challenge to any act of the judicial administrator shall be brought before the supervising judge, who shall decide upon it within three days from the date of its receipt.

The appointed judge, acting upon complaints filed with him by the debtor, creditors, or at the request of the Republic's representative within the scope of his authority, and even of his own motion, may propose the replacement of the judicial administrator.

If the supervising judge does not decide on the complaints submitted to him within the time limit specified in the first paragraph, they may be raised to the court for decision within seven days from the date of their receipt. If the replacement of the judicial administrator is deemed necessary, the supervising judge shall refer the matter to the court, which shall proceed with the replacement after hearing him.

The judicial administrator who is relieved of his duties shall submit his accounts to the new judicial administrator, with a record drawn up by the supervising judge, within a maximum period of fifteen days from the date of his relief of duties, following a summons sent to the debtor by registered mail with acknowledgment of receipt and notification of delivery.
