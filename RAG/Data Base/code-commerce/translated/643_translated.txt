Except in cases where the carrier or its user is found to have committed gross negligence or intentional fault, the carrier may stipulate in the contract, but with the sender being informed of the condition:

1) Limitation of its liability for loss or damage, provided that the agreed-upon penalty is not significantly lower than the value of the item itself, rendering it effectively non-existent.

2) Full or partial exemption from liability for delays.
