The court may at any time, even on its own initiative, rule on the closure of bankruptcy proceedings, even without liquidation.

Liquidation refers to the process of settling debts and distributing assets in the case of bankruptcy.

If the debtor has no assets or their value is negligible based on a report, which is a form of information delivery prepared in a near-final format for future use, the assigned judge, after summoning the debtor and the observers, as required by law, may rule on the closure of proceedings.

The debtor or any interested party may at any time request the court to reverse this ruling if they prove the existence of sufficient funds to cover the expenses required for bankruptcy proceedings or deposit with the trustee the amount sufficient to cover these expenses. In all cases, the expenses for carrying out the legal actions necessary for bankruptcy proceedings must be paid in advance.
