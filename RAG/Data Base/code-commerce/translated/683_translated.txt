The bank may, if it does not have sufficient funds, refuse transfer orders directed to it directly, provided that it informs the party concerned of such refusal without delay. If the transfer order was submitted by the beneficiary, the beneficiary shall be provided with the partial balance amount, unless he/she refuses it. The transfer order form must state whether the available portion of the balance will be paid or whether the beneficiary has refused. 

In the event of refusal of the transfer order or refusal to receive the balance as described in the preceding paragraphs of this chapter, no lien shall be imposed on the partial balance.
