The maturity of a bill of exchange payable after sight is determined either by the date of acceptance or by the date of protest.

If no protest is drawn up, then acceptance without stating the date is deemed, for the acceptor, to have taken place on the last day of the term set for presenting the bill of exchange for acceptance.

The maturity of a bill of exchange payable after a specific date or after sight occurs on the corresponding date of the month or months stated.

The maturity of a bill of exchange payable a month or months after the month in which payment is to be made occurs on the last day of the aforementioned month, if no corresponding date exists.

If the bill of exchange is payable after one or more months and a half from its date or from sight, then the calculation of the full months must be commenced. If the maturity occurs at the beginning, middle, or end of a month, this expression, in its various aspects, is understood to mean the first, fifteenth, or last day of the month.

The expression "eight days" or "fifteen days" does not refer to a week or two weeks, but rather to a term of eight days or fifteen days in full.

The expression "half a month" is understood to mean fifteen days.
