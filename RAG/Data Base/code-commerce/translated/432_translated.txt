If an amicable settlement cannot be reached within the timeframe set out in Article 425 of this Code, or if the debtor fails to appear before the Conciliator despite being summoned according to law, or if the institution ceases to make payments, the Conciliator, the debtor, the creditor, or any other interested party shall immediately inform the President of the Court. The President of the Court has the authority to terminate the Conciliator's duties, end the amicable settlement proceedings, and, after summoning and hearing the debtor, authorize the initiation of judicial settlement proceedings if the file documents demonstrate that the institution has ceased to pay its debts as defined in Article 434 of this Code. The President of the Court shall inform the debtor, the creditors, and the Committee for Monitoring Economic Institutions of his decision.
