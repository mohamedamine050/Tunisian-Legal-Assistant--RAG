If the referral occurs after the filing of an objection or the expiration of the filing deadline, it shall only have the consequences of a regular referral. 

A referral without a date shall be considered to have taken place before the filing of an objection or the expiration of the deadline referred to in the preceding paragraph, unless proven otherwise.

The submission of the dates of the orders is prohibited, as this would constitute falsification.
