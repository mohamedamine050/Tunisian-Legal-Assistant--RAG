Contrary to the provisions of Article 292 of the Real Estate Code, upon sale, the establishment is purged of all prior debts and encumbrances, including superior ones, and ownership is transferred to the transferee upon fulfillment of all his obligations and payment of the full price.

The price agreed upon by the contracting parties, whether it exceeds or falls short of the value of the property sold, shall be subject to the reservation of the sale proceeds for the benefit of the creditors.

With regard to ongoing contracts authorized by the court to continue in accordance with the provisions of Article 461 of this Code, the transferee shall substitute the transferor in all his rights and obligations acquired or due since the date of the transfer.
