The drawer of the check containing a general endorsement may not pay it except to a bank, the head of the postal check office, or one of the drawer's agents. The drawer of the check containing a special endorsement may not pay it to anyone other than the designated bank. If the drawer is the designated bank, the check may not be paid except to its authorized employee, provided that the designated bank may seek payment from another bank. 

A bank may not acquire a check containing an endorsement except from one of its agents, the head of the postal check office, or from another bank. It is not permitted for a bank to accept a check for the account of individuals other than its own.

If the check contains multiple special endorsements, the drawer may not pay it unless the endorsements do not exceed two lines, one of which requires collection from one of the clearing houses. If the drawer or bank neglects to observe the above provisions, they shall be liable for compensation for damages in an amount equal to the amount of the check.
