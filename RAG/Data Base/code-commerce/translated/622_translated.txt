If the broker appoints another person on his behalf, he shall be liable to guarantee him: (1) if he does not have a license to delegate his authority. 

(2) If the aforementioned license was issued without specifying a particular person, and the person he chose to represent him is known for his incapacity and lack of solvency.

In both cases, the broker and his deputy shall be jointly liable. The person who entrusted the broker may directly claim against the person appointed by the broker as his deputy.
