A creditor who benefits from guarantees signed, endorsed, or co-signed by the debtor in solidarity with other co-debtors who have ceased to pay their debts, is entitled to share with all creditors, up to the amount of the principal debt stated in his proof of debt, and to participate in distributions until his entire debt is recovered.
