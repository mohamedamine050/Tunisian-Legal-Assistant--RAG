Within fifteen days of the publication of the company's contract, which includes the contribution of a commercial asset to its capital, any creditor of the partner contributing with his share in this manner, who has not yet registered his debt, must notify the Registry of the Court where the contract was deposited of his debt and the amount due to him, and receive from the clerk a certificate of the receipt of his notification.

If the company is formed upon the contribution of a commercial asset to its capital, creditors of the partner who owned the commercial asset, if they have not obtained registration of their claims, must notify the Registry of the Court within whose jurisdiction the commercial asset is located, within fifteen days of the publication of the contract containing the contribution of the share in the manner mentioned in Article 191.

If the partners or one of them does not, within fifteen days following, bring an action to request the annulment of the company or the cancellation of the share, and no judgment is issued to that effect, the company shall be bound to join the original debtor in paying the debts notified within the aforementioned period and supported by evidence of their existence.
