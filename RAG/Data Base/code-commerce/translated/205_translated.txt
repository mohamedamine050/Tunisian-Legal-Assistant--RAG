A seller's privilege over a commercial establishment is not established unless it is recorded by an official document or by handwritten documents registered in accordance with the law, and it is included in its registration in a public registry kept by the court whose jurisdiction covers the commercial establishment. The seller's privilege shall only apply to the elements of the commercial establishment listed in the sale agreement and the registration. If the privilege's scope is not precisely defined, it shall only apply to the name and address of the commercial establishment, the right to lease, the customers, and the commercial reputation.

The intangible elements of the commercial establishment, equipment, and goods are valued separately. The seller's privilege is executed to secure the price of each part of the aforementioned components or any remaining amount due, at the prices obtained from the resale of the goods, equipment, and intangible elements contained in the commercial establishment, each on its own.

Despite any contrary agreement, partial claims, excluding urgent claims, shall be satisfied first from the price of the goods, then from the price of the equipment. 

If the price available for distribution is obtained from the sale of one or several elements included in the initial sale, the value of each shall be determined separately based on its resale price.
