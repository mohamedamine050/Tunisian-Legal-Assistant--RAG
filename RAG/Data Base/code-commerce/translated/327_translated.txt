If payment is made by way of intervention, it must be proven by a receipt placed on the bill of exchange, specifying the person who received the payment for his benefit. If this person is not specified, payment is considered to have been made for the benefit of the drawer.

The bill of exchange and any protest, if previously drawn up, must be delivered to the person from whom the payment was received by way of intervention.
