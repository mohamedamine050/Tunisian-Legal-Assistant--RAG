No claim shall be made against the carrier for partial damage or loss of the goods after delivery, unless the consignee, the consignor, or any person acting on their behalf, within three days of the date of delivery, excluding official holidays, notifies the carrier by an officer of the court or by registered mail with acknowledgment of receipt, and lodges a protest specifying the reasons thereof.

This protest shall be valid regardless of the method of notification, provided that the notification document in the possession of the carrier demonstrates that it was issued within the aforementioned deadline. If either party requests the examination prescribed in Article 645 before receiving the goods or within three days of receiving them, this request shall constitute a protest in itself, without the need to follow the procedures specified in the first paragraph of this Article.
