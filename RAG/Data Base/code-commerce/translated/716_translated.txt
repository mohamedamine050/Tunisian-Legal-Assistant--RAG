If an agreement is reached to deliver the **mortgage** to a third party not involved in the original contract, the delivery of the **mortgage** shall be deemed as a waiver by the mortgagee of his right to retain possession of the property, which he may have acquired as a result of prior reasons relating to the **mortgage**, unless he expressly reserves this right when accepting the mortgagor's continued possession. 

A **formal mortgage** is a contract by which a creditor acquires a real right over a property dedicated to the repayment of his debt. This right allows him to take precedence over ordinary creditors and creditors who are ranked after him in the order of priority, in the recovery of his right from the proceeds of that property, in whosever hands it may be.
