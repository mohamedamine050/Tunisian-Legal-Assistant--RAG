Every creditor who is a secured creditor or an objector has the right, upon the issuance of the public auction announcement, to substitute another in their place to carry out the sale procedures if the bidder neglects their claim to purchase within one month from the date of the auction. The bidder, even if they have paid the auction amount, is not permitted to prevent the public auction from taking place by withdrawing from the sale unless all the secured creditors agree to this.
