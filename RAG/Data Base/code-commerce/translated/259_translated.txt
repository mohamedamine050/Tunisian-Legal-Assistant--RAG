If the sale price is definitively determined with respect to all elements of the commercial asset, and if the creditors do not reach an agreement on the distribution of the price by mutual consent, the buyer shall, after being notified by one of the creditors, within fifteen days of such notification, secure the portion of the price due, and any subsequent payments as they become due, in the Deposit and Trust Fund, until the distribution list is definitively issued, taking into account the objections declared by the aforementioned buyer, the encumbrances on the commercial asset or its different elements, and the debt assignments previously notified to him.  Furthermore, he shall deposit with the administrator designated pursuant to Article 243 the commercial securities representing the portion of the price not yet due, and, as appropriate, the amount of each portion of the price subject to a due date, to be paid after the date of deposit of the distribution list according to the due dates.
