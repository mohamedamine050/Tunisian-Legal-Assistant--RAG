The drawer, or any endorser or guarantor, may appoint a person to accept or pay upon demand.

Any person may intervene for the benefit of a debtor subject to the obligation to pay, by accepting or paying the bill of exchange, subject to the following conditions.

The drawee himself or any other person who was obliged by the bill of exchange may be the intervenor, whether a stranger or a party to the bill.

The intervenor must notify the person for whom he intervened within the next two business days. If he fails to observe this deadline, he shall be liable, as the case may be, for the damages arising from his negligence, without exceeding the amount of the bill of exchange as compensation for such damages.
