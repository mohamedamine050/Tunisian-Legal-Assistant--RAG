If the depositary fails to recover the mortgaged property, the appointed judge may authorize the creditor to sell it according to legal procedures. If the depositary neglects to perform his duties, he may, after obtaining authorization from the appointed judge, notifying the creditor, and hearing their statements, proceed with the sale. The decision by the appointed judge authorizing the sale must be communicated to the mortgagee creditor.

If the creditor sells the mortgaged property for a price exceeding their debt, the depositary shall receive the excess. If the sale price is less than the debt, the mortgagee creditor shall share in the remaining amount with the other creditors as an ordinary creditor.
