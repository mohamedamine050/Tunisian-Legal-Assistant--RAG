If the trustee does not have sufficient funds on hand to make the payment stipulated in the preceding article, the amounts due to their rightful owners must be satisfied from the first available cash receipts, notwithstanding the existence of any other preferred debt, regardless of its priority. If the aforementioned amounts are paid by the trustee or any other person before the payment to the rightful owners, the person who made the advance payment shall take the place of those who were paid for this reason, and the amount paid to them must be reimbursed as soon as sufficient revenue becomes available. No other creditor may object to the payment of the debt.
