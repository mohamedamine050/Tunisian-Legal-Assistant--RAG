The endorsement must be written on the same check or on a separate sheet attached to it, and must be signed by the endorser.

The endorsement may not designate a beneficiary and may be limited only to the signature of the endorser, which is an endorsement in blank. In this latter case, for the endorsement to be valid, it must be written on the back of the check or on the attached sheet.
