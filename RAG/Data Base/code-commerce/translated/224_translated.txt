If the sale of the commercial principal is sought through public auction, whether by a trustee in bankruptcy or another person appointed by the court to liquidate or administer the assets, or by a right holder seeking permission from the judge to sell, he shall be required to notify one of the previous auctioneers at their designated place of business specified in their records, informing them that if they do not file a lawsuit for annulment within one month from the date of notification, their right to do so shall be extinguished against the bidder.
