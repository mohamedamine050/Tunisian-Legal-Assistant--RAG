If it appears that the request for judicial settlement is serious, the President of the First Instance Court shall authorize the initiation of judicial settlement proceedings. He may decide to reject the request by means of a reasoned decision. If it appears to the President of the Court that placing the company under judicial supervision is the only way to salvage it, he shall, after initiating judicial settlement proceedings, refer the case to the Chamber of Counsel, pursuant to the provisions of Article 437 of this Code. 

He may, notwithstanding any contrary legal provisions, request information about the company's situation from the debtor or from any public or financial administration or institution or from the Committee for the Monitoring of Economic Companies.
