This **sequestration** order may be applied to any sum due to one party from a current account held with a third party, subject to the procedures established by law. However, this **sequestration** order shall not prejudice the rights of the debtor's client, established by an account statement, which are secured by a condition that prevents the client from freely disposing of the amount resulting from the balance at any time.
