By law, from the date of issuance of the bankruptcy judgment until the judgment of closure of bankruptcy, the debtor is prohibited from managing and disposing of all his assets, including any assets he acquires in any way.

The bankruptcy trustee shall exercise all of the debtor's rights and claims related to his assets. However, the debtor may take all precautionary measures to preserve his rights and may intervene in the cases pursued by the trustee.
