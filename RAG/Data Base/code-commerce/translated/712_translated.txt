If the mortgaged assets were in the possession of the mortgagee before the contract, in any way, it shall be considered that he acquired possession as a secured creditor from the time of the contract.

If the mortgaged assets were in the possession of a third party holding them in any other manner, the secured creditor shall not be considered to have acquired possession of them except from the date of their registration by the third party holder in a dedicated account that he is required to open upon the first request.

As for the assets for which a nominal certificate has been issued, certifying their registration in the books of the company that issued them, the secured creditor shall not be considered to have acquired possession of them except from the date of the registration of the transfer of the guarantee.
