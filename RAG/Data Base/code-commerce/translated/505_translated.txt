Any complaint regarding the actions of the trustees shall be submitted to the designated judge who shall adjudicate it within three days of its receipt.

The designated judge, based on complaints filed by the debtor, creditors, or at the request of the  Republic's representative within his jurisdiction, or even on his own initiative, may propose the replacement of the trustee.

If the designated judge does not adjudicate the complaints submitted to him within the deadline specified in the first paragraph, they may be submitted to the Court for adjudication within seven days of their receipt.

If it becomes necessary to replace the trustees or increase their number by one or more, the designated judge shall consult the Court in this matter, which shall be responsible for their replacement after hearing them or appointing them.
