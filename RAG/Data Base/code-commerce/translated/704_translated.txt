Any person holding an executive warrant or authorization on a petition, both of which mandate the execution of a *saisie-conservatoire*, which empowers the creditor holding an executive instrument to place the movable property in the possession of his debtor under judicial custody, may apply to the bank or to the safe deposit box located in one of the banks, which is at the disposal of the lessee designated by the judgment, for the purpose of keeping it sealed.

For this purpose, the executing officer shall request the bank to provide him with the judgment ordering the execution or to confirm the existence of the safe deposit box with them. If the bank confirms the existence of the safe deposit box, the officer shall notify the bank not to allow anyone access to it. The officer shall then draw up a report mentioning the judgment pursuant to which the proceedings were carried out and shall deliver a copy of it to the bank. Within forty-eight hours, the officer shall notify the lessee of the seizure of his safe deposit box by a registered letter with return receipt requested, if the executing officer holds a judgment ordering the execution of a *saisie-conservatoire*, which empowers the creditor holding an executive instrument to place the movable property in the possession of his debtor under judicial custody. The lessee may then apply for a summary judgment to overturn the decision or to authorize him to take some of the items from the safe deposit box.

If the executing officer holds an executive warrant, he may, after notifying the lessee, proceed to open the safe deposit box after securing the costs of opening and repair.

Upon opening the safe deposit box, execution shall be carried out in accordance with the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure. However, if the person whose property is seized is absent and documents are found, they shall be gathered in a single bundle and stamped by both the executing officer and the bank, and the bank shall keep them at the disposal of the lessee of the safe deposit box.

The party conducting the proceedings shall pay the bank an advance sufficient to enable it to cover the cost of renting the safe deposit box for the duration of its sealing.
