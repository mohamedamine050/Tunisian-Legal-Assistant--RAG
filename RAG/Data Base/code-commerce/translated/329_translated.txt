A promissory note may be issued in multiple counterparts, which are similar in form.

These counterparts must be specifically numbered in the text of the promissory note, otherwise, each counterpart shall be considered as an independent promissory note in itself.  Any holder of a promissory note that does not indicate it was issued in a specific counterpart is entitled to request, at their own expense, the delivery of multiple counterparts thereof. For this purpose, they must contact the drawer directly. The drawer must provide assistance in seeking the necessary counterparts from the holder and so on, ascending until reaching the drawee. The drawers must re-endorse their endorsements on the new counterparts.
