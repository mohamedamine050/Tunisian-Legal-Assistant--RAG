All debts arising from transactions of one party that are not secured by legal or contractual guarantees shall be lawfully entered into the account, unless the agreement contains general or specific conditions for some of them to remain outside it.

However, debts secured by contractual guarantees from one party or another may be included in the account by virtue of a specific and explicit agreement between all parties to the contract.
