Each of the documents shall be accompanied by two schedules, drawn up on plain paper, one of which may be attached to the original agreement or its copy, and both of which shall contain the following details: (1) the names of the seller and the buyer, and the owner of the commercial establishment if he is a third party, along with their titles, addresses, and professions, if any.

(2) The date and type of the agreement. (3) The purchase price determined for the equipment, goods, and intangible elements of the commercial establishment, each separately, with an indication, if necessary, of the financial liabilities resulting from their valuation.

(4) A description of the commercial establishment and its branches, if any, specifying the elements that comprise it and that are covered by the sale, along with a mention of the type of operations carried out by the establishment and its branches, and the location of the headquarters of each. This shall be done without neglecting all the details that serve to identify them. If the sale includes other elements besides the business address, the commercial name, the right to lease, and the customers, they shall be mentioned in detail.
