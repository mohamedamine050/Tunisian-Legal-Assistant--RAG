An irrevocable credit requires the bank to undertake a firm and direct obligation towards the beneficiary or bona fide holders of the drafts.

This obligation cannot be revoked or modified without the consent of all parties to the contract. An irrevocable credit may be confirmed by another bank, in which case that bank undertakes a firm and direct obligation towards the beneficiary.

However, the notification issued to the beneficiary by another bank that a credit has been opened in their favor does not constitute, in itself, confirmation of that credit.
