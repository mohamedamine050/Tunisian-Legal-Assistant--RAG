The curator of the bankruptcy proceedings summons the debtor to seal the books and suspend their accounts in his presence, if this has not already been done. If the debtor fails to appear after being summoned, he is sent a notice to appear within a maximum of forty-eight hours. He may appoint a representative with a written power of attorney not subject to any other requirements, if he proves to the appointed judge reasons for his failure to appear that the judge deems worthy of consideration.

The debtor's absence before the curator of the bankruptcy proceedings does not prevent the completion of the procedures.
