Within a period not exceeding twenty days from the publication of the announcement in the Official Gazette of the Tunisian Republic, any creditor of the former owner, whether or not their claim is due, may oppose the payment of the purchase price by means of a sworn statement before a bailiff or by registered letter with acknowledgement of receipt, with notification addressed to the designated address.

The opposition must include the name and address of the opponent, the amount of their claim, the reasons for the opposition, otherwise it shall be invalid. The buyer shall not be entitled to oppose the payment for the purpose of obtaining a rent guarantee or extension of the deadline, regardless of any contrary stipulation.

No objections may be raised against creditors who have been notified in the manner and within the time limit mentioned above, regarding any transfer of the purchase price, whether voluntary or authorized by the court.

An application for cancellation of the opposition must be filed with the President of the Court within whose jurisdiction the commercial document falls.
