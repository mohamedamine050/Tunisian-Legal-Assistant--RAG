## English Translation:

Commercial registers may be accepted by the courts for use as evidence among merchants in their commercial transactions, provided that they are organized.

**Organization** refers to a social group composed of interacting individuals according to established **regulations.**

However, mandatory registers kept by merchants without regard for the **regulations** previously prescribed for them may not be presented or relied upon as evidence in court for those who possess them, considering the special circumstances stipulated in the book concerning collective procedures (amended by Article 2 of Law No. 36 of 2016 dated April 29, 2016).
