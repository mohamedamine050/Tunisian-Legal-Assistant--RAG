The executing bailiffs are obligated to retain a copy conforming to the original of the objections, failing which they shall be subject to dismissal, liability for expenses, and compensation for damages to the opposing party.  They are also obligated, under the same penalty, to deliver to the clerk of the court in whose jurisdiction the debtor's domicile is located, or to forward to him by registered mail with acknowledgment of receipt and notification of service, a copy conforming to the original of the objections, for failing to pay the drafts containing acceptance and order instruments.  They must complete this procedure within fifteen days from the date of lodging the objection.
