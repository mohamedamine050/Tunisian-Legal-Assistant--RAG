It is permissible for any creditor holding a lien on commercial property, if Article 249 is not applicable, to request authorization for its sale by public auction, provided that they offer to increase its original price by 10% for equipment and goods, and provide a guarantor for the payment of dues and financial obligations, or prove their sufficient capacity for payment in accordance with Article 195.

Upon the signing of the aforementioned authorization by the creditor, notice thereof must be given to the buyer and the previous owner of the commercial property within fifteen days of the aforementioned notifications and summons, inviting them to appear before the court to address any dispute regarding the validity of the auction, the sufficiency of the guarantor's acceptance, or the bidder's capacity to pay. The authorization to sell the commercial property, including its associated equipment and goods, through public auction, must be given. The buyer of the auctioned property shall be obligated to inform the General Manager assigned to the sale of the purchase or lease agreement, or its transfer, failing which the creditor's right to request authorization will lapse.
