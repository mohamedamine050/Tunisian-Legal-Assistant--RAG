A confirmed credit shall not be transferable or divisible unless the bank which has established the credit for the specific beneficiary is authorized by the originator to pay all or part of it to one or more persons not covered by the agreement, pursuant to the instructions of the first beneficiary. A confirmed credit may only be transferred upon express authorization of the issuing bank, and may only be transferred once unless otherwise stipulated.
