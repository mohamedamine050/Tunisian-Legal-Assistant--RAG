The owner, operator, or master of a ship that is wrecked or sunk in a port shall be required to repair and refloat the ship, remove it to land, or move it outside the port limits within one month of the date of notification by the port authority in a registered letter with proof of delivery to his last known address. The notice shall include a warning that the ship will be sold at public auction or destroyed if it is deemed unfit for use, in the event that the notice is not complied with. In the event that the owner, operator, or master of the ship is not present or fails to complete what is required of him within the timeframe mentioned in the first paragraph of this chapter, or if his whereabouts are unknown, the port authority shall, after obtaining a summary judgment from the competent court, proceed with the sale of the derelict ship at public auction or its destruction if it is deemed unfit for use.
