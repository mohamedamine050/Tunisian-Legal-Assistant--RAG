The port authority or the port operator may order the master of a vessel to move their vessel from its location or to remove it from the water at their own expense and responsibility whenever the exploitation of the port or the safety and security of the port facilities and equipment requires it. In the event that the master of the vessel fails to comply with the aforementioned order or is unable to execute it, the port authority or the port operator may take the necessary measures to move the vessel from its location or to remove it to land or to an open anchorage area at the expense and under the responsibility of the vessel's owner, operator, or their representative.
