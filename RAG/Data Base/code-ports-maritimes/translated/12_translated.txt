Port officers exercise their duties under the authority of the Port Director and are tasked with ensuring the application of the provisions of this Code and its implementing texts throughout the entire extent of the public domain of ports. The Port Director and port officers take the oath. The oath is taken by one of the parties to a dispute or by both parties to the other party in order to resolve the dispute between them, if the legal evidence necessary to prove their claim is lacking, relying on the conscience, honor, and religion of the other party. This is in accordance with the law in force, and they may avail themselves of public force to perform their duties.
