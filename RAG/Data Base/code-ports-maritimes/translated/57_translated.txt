Every owner or operator of a commercial vessel that has sunk or run aground in port waters or its adjuncts must immediately proceed to refloat or salvage it, or to remove it after obtaining the approval of the port authority for the method used to accomplish the refloating or salvage. In the event of default, the port authority may take the necessary measures to expedite the execution of these works at the expense and liability of its owner or operator.
