The Port Authority may, in the event of overcrowding in certain areas, enable their users to utilize other vacant areas that have been assigned under a lease or temporary occupancy to other users. The lessee or occupant in this case has the right to a deduction from the lease fee or occupancy fee, calculated based on the area and duration of its utilization by others.
