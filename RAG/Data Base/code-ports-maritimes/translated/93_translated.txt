The owner, operator, or master of a ship that is wrecked or sunk in the port shall be required to repair and refloat the ship, or to remove it to land or move it outside the port limits within one month of the date of notification by the port authority. The notification shall be in writing with acknowledgement of receipt and shall be delivered to the last known address of the owner, operator, or master. The notification shall include a warning that the ship will be sold at public auction or destroyed if it is deemed unfit for use, in the event of failure to comply with the notification. 

In the event that the owner, operator, or master of the ship is absent, or fails to comply with the requirements of the first paragraph of this section, or is unknown, the port authority, after obtaining an urgent written decision from the competent court, shall proceed with the sale of the abandoned ship at public auction or its destruction if it is deemed unfit for use. In the event that a foreign ship is subject to the procedures outlined in the preceding paragraph of this section, the customs authorities shall be notified accordingly.
