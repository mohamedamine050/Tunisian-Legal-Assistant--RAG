In the event of a serious or repeated breach by any natural person or legal entity practicing a profession within the port or violation of the provisions of this Code or the terms of any specifications set out in Article 119 thereof, the following sanctions may be taken against them, regardless of any criminal prosecution:

- A warning.
- Suspension from practicing the activity for a maximum period of six months.
- Permanent suspension from practicing the activity.

The sanctions of a warning and suspension from practicing the activity for a period not exceeding six months are imposed by the port authority. The sanction of permanent suspension from practicing the activity is imposed by the Minister responsible for the port's activities, upon the proposal of the port authority.

The sanction of suspension from practicing the activity is taken after obtaining the opinion of the disciplinary committee. The committee is composed of a chairperson and two members, one representing the port operator and the other representing the profession concerned. They are appointed by decree of the Minister responsible for the port's activities, upon the proposal of the port authority and the parties they represent.

In all cases, before imposing the sanction, the offender shall be invited by the port authority to submit his observations in defense within a maximum period of fifteen days from the date of his invitation by registered letter with acknowledgment of receipt, and notification of delivery.
