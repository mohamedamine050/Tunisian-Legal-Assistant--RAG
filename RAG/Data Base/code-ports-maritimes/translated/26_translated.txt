In the event of the death of the holder of the concession, the concession and the real rights arising from it may be transferred to the heirs, provided that the person agreed upon among them submits a written request to the Minister responsible for port activities within a maximum period of one year from the date of death and obtains his approval. In the absence of a written agreement within the aforementioned period, the contract shall be terminated without compensation. To ensure the continuity of port exploitation, the port authority may, during this period, manage the port at the expense of the concession holder.
