The storage of perishable or health-hazardous materials and the placement of waste on the quays and uncovered areas or in port warehouses is prohibited, unless authorized by the port authority or necessitated by force majeure.  In the event of non-compliance with a notice issued by any means leaving a written trace by the port authority to remove these materials, the port authority shall do so at the expense and responsibility of the party who placed them, regardless of any proceedings that may be taken to compensate for damages.
