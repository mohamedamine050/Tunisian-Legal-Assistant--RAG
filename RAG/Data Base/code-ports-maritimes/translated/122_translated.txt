The final decision to permanently deprive someone from practicing the profession in maritime ports may be taken in the following cases:

* If the conditions required to practice the profession in the port are no longer met by the concerned individual, and they do not take steps to rectify their situation within one month of being notified in writing by registered mail with acknowledgment of receipt.

* If a final written decision from the court, resolving a legal or factual issue, has been issued against them declaring them bankrupt.

* If they cease practicing the profession for more than one year and do not resume their activity within one month of being notified in writing by registered mail with acknowledgment of receipt. This applies in the case of a recurrence after a temporary deprivation from practicing the activity within the last three years.
