Every vessel present in the port must be seaworthy. If a vessel becomes unseaworthy, is in danger of sinking, or could cause damage to port facilities and surrounding vessels, or impede the use of the port, its owner, operator, or their representative must promptly repair or remove it from the water. In case of negligence, the port authority shall issue a written notice to the vessel's owner, operator, or their representative to immediately repair or remove the vessel. Where necessary, the port authority shall take the necessary measures to preserve port facilities and property within the port.
