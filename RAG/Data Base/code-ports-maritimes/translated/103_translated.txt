All operations required for the loading and unloading of goods at the port are carried out by the loading and unloading contractor in accordance with applicable legislation. However, the holders of port terminal concessions may carry out these operations using their own port equipment and facilities. The types of goods to which the provisions of the second paragraph of this chapter apply are determined by a decision of the Minister in charge of transport.
