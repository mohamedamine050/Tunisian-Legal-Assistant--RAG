In the event that the ship owner, master, or operator, or their representative, is present prior to the completion of the sale or demolition, they may request the suspension of the process, provided they immediately undertake to repair the ship or remove it to land outside the port area, and pay the expenses incurred by the port authority for this purpose. 

If the undertaking stipulated in the first paragraph of this section is not fulfilled within eight days of its date, the port authority shall resume the sale or demolition proceedings, regardless of any actions to recover damages resulting therefrom.
