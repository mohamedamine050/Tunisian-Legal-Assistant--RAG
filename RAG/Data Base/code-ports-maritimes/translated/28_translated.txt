Fishing vessels and recreational vessels may not enter, leave, or navigate within ports without first obtaining a permit from the port authority or the port operator. Commercial vessels are prohibited from entering, leaving, or navigating within commercial ports without a license from the port authority or the port operator. This license is issued after inspection, if deemed necessary, conducted by the maritime authority at the request of the port authority or the port operator. The port authority may prevent the entry of vessels that could pose a threat to the safety, security, health, hygiene, environmental protection, or proper operation of the port.
