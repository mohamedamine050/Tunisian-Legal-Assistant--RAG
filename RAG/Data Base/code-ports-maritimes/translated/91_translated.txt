Every owner of a vessel intending to leave it in port without a crew, master, operator, or their representatives shall, before leaving Tunisian territory, appoint a representative or proxy residing in Tunisia who shall be responsible for taking the measures authorized by the competent authority. They must deliver the keys to the port authority or the port operator or remove them to land and place them in the designated location prepared in accordance with applicable legislation. The port authority may not authorize the vessel to be used again unless the owner presents a free movement license issued by the customs authorities. The port authority shall inform the relevant port authorities of any issuance or withdrawal of a free movement license.
