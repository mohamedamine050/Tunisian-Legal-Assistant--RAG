Every vessel moored in the port must be in good condition in terms of maintenance, buoyancy, and safety. The owner or operator of a vessel that is in a state of neglect, threatened with sinking, or may cause damage to other vessels or adjacent facilities, or disrupts the proper operation and use of the port and the normal flow of public utilities, must repair or beach it. If the necessary action is not taken after being notified by any means leaving a written record and within the specified period, the port authority shall, if necessary, beach the vessel at the owner's expense and under their responsibility, regardless of any judicial proceedings for damages.
