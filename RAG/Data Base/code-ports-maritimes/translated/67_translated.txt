Pilotage shall be mandatory during entry into or exit from commercial maritime ports, as well as during any movement within the waters of these ports, for any vessel exceeding a size to be determined by decision of the Minister in charge of Transport. The port authority may require a vessel smaller than the size specified in the first paragraph of this chapter to avail itself of pilotage services if safety conditions so require.
