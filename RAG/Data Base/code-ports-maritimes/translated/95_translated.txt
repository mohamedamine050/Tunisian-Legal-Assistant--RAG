In the event of the presence of the owner, operator, master, or their representative at the time of the sale or destruction, they may request the cessation of the process, provided they immediately undertake to repair the vessel, or remove it to land outside the port area, or to a place under customs control for foreign vessels, and to pay the expenses incurred by the port authority for this purpose. 

Should they fail to fulfill the undertaking stipulated in the first paragraph of this section within eight days from its date, the port authority shall resume the sale or destruction procedures, notwithstanding any legal action for damages resulting from it.
