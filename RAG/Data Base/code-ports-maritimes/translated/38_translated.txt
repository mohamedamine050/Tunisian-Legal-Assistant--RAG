The responsibility of responding to a person's actions before the law or compensating for the damage caused falls upon the owner or operator of the vessel, or their representative, for the safeguarding of every vessel docked in the port. The regulations specific to each port determine the organization of the vessel guarding activity within the port and how to assign the appropriate individual to the position, in accordance with the qualifications and competencies required to fulfill its responsibilities.  The port guards are designated based on the requirements of the port's operations, safety, and security.
