## English Translation:

Maritime ports are categorized into commercial ports, fishing ports, and recreational ports. 

A list of each category of maritime ports is established by decree, proposed by the Minister responsible for the port's activities, after taking into consideration the opinion of the Supreme Council for Maritime Ports as provided for in Article 124 of this Code. 

If a port has multiple activities, it shall be classified according to its primary activity.
