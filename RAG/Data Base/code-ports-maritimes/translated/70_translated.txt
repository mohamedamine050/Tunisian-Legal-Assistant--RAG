Every vessel berthed at a commercial maritime port must have a sufficient crew to perform any necessary maneuvers, respond to safety and security requirements, or utilize the port. In cases where safety and security requirements necessitate the relocation of a vessel and the vessel lacks a sufficient crew to perform the required maneuvers, the port authority may take all necessary measures and steps at the expense and under the responsibility of the owner or operator of the vessel or their representatives.
