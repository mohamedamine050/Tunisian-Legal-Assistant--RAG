Every vessel moored in the port must be in good condition in terms of maintenance, floatation, and safety. The owner or operator of a vessel that is in a state of neglect or is threatened with sinking or may cause damage to other vessels or to adjacent facilities, or that disrupts the proper management and use of the port and the normal operation of the public facility, must repair or remove it to dry land. If the necessary actions are not taken after being notified by any means leaving a written trace and within the specified time, the port authority shall, if necessary, remove the vessel to dry land at the expense of its owner and under its responsibility, irrespective of any legal proceedings for damages.
