The port authority may compel any vessel, prior to its departure, to discharge used oils, water, and waste found on board either into designated areas and facilities or by delivering them to licensed port operators. The port authority may also prohibit the vessel from leaving the port until it has complied with this order and carried out the necessary inspections on board.
