Any person who spills, throws, or places materials or waste of any origin in the port must immediately inform the port authority. The person who carried out these actions, particularly the ship's master, the port operator, and the port user, each within their respective capacities, are required to clean the contaminated water areas or facilities and restore them to their original state. In the event of non-compliance with the notice issued by any means that leaves a written trace, the port authority undertakes to authorize the cleaning of the contaminated water areas or facilities and their restoration to their original state at the expense and liability of the person who carried out these actions, regardless of any further legal action that may be taken to recover damages.
