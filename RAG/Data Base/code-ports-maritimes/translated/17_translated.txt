Every seaport must be equipped with the technical, commercial, industrial, and tourism services required for its operation and utilization, in accordance with the legislation and regulations in force. The regulations specific to each port will determine the services to be provided, the methods of their delivery, and the procedures for accessing them, depending on the port's category and activities.
