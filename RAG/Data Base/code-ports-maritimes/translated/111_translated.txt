It is not permissible to place fishing equipment or any materials on the wharves, uncovered areas, or warehouses without a license from the port authority or the port operator. The port authority or the port operator may, for reasons related to the exploitation, safety, security, health, hygiene, and environmental protection of the port, notify, by any means leaving a written record, those entitled to these equipment, materials, or their representatives, to remove them within a specified period. In the event of failure to do so, the port authority is authorized to seize and move these items, either within or outside the port, at the expense and under the responsibility of those entitled to them. If the owner of these items is unknown, a notice shall be posted at the port authority for 15 days. Upon expiration of this period, the seized items shall be disposed of after obtaining an urgent ruling from the court competent in terms of jurisdiction.
