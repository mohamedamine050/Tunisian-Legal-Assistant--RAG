The port authority or the port operator may request the authority to subject any vessel to a departure inspection before its departure from the port to ensure that it is in a condition that allows it to sail. The maritime authority may prevent or postpone the departure of any vessel that is found to be unseaworthy or poses a danger to the persons on board or to the environment. The captain, owner, or their representative shall be informed accordingly.
