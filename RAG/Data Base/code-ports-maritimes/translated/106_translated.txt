The stay of goods at commercial maritime ports shall not exceed the period stipulated in the regulations specific to each port. The port authority or the port operator may, for reasons related to the exploitation of the port, the safety and berthing of vessels, their security, health, hygiene, and the preservation of the environment, issue a written notice, by any means that leaves a trace, to those entitled to the goods or their representatives to remove such goods within a specified time period. In the event that this is not done, the port authority shall authorize the removal of these goods, after informing the customs authorities, either within the port or outside it in areas subject to customs control, at the expense and responsibility of those entitled to the goods.
