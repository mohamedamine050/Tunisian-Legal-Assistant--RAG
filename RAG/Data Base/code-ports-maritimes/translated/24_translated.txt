If the occupation of the public domain of ports does not involve the construction of buildings, structures, or fixed equipment, it may be carried out by virtue of a contract.

**Contract**

A contract is a legally binding agreement that obligates the contracting parties and defines their obligations and rights in relation to the specific transaction.

This contract may be concluded with natural or legal persons as stipulated in Article 119 of this code or with institutions whose activities are related to port activities.
