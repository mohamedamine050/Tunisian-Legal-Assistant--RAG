It is not permissible to place equipment, installations, or any other materials on the pavements, uncovered areas, or warehouses without a license from the port authority or the port operator. The port authority or the port operator may, for reasons relating to the exploitation, safety, security, health, hygiene, and environmental protection of the port, give notice, by any means leaving a written trace, to those entitled to such equipment, installations, or materials, or their representatives, to remove them within a specified time. In the event of failure to do so, the port authority may authorize the removal of these items, either within or outside the port, at the expense and responsibility of those entitled to them. If the equipment, installations, or other materials belong to a foreign ship, the port authority must inform the customs authorities of any transfer, whether within or outside the port, in places subject to customs control.
