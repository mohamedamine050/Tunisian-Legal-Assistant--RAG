**English Translation:**

Authorized officials tasked with inspecting wildlife hunting offenses may conduct inspection visits to search for game in public squares, markets, public or private vehicles, all types of inns, restaurants, hotels, food vendors, and, generally, in all places where game may be stored for the purposes of sale or consumption. Wildlife held illegally shall be seized and released if alive, or surrendered to a specialized institution for care until its release into the wild is possible, or delivered to a research laboratory or scientific institute if deceased. If this proves impossible, the animal shall be disposed of. Local administrative authorities shall execute these procedures based on the seizure report. The provisions of the third paragraph of Article 119 concerning house searches shall apply.
