If the accused claims ownership of a property after the publication of a case concerning the redress of damage resulting from one of the offenses stipulated in the Code, and if this claim is such that it would remove all criminal character from the act, the court may grant a period of two months to enable the accused to file a claim before the courts competent to hear real estate matters if the property in dispute is not registered or to present the land registry document. The subsidiary claim of the perpetrator of the offense shall not be admitted unless it is supported by a document or by factual elements of such significance and precision as to raise doubt about the ownership of the property in question.
