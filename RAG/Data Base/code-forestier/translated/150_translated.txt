A decision by the Minister responsible for Forests (1) may authorize the execution of sand stabilization at the expense of the state on private or social property, which is identified by decree. The “Ministry responsible for Forests” (1) retains ownership of the sand dunes in any area legally established and collects the timber resulting from their exploitation until it recovers all the expenses it incurred for the execution of the works in that area. Upon recovery of these expenses, the dunes are returned to their owners, subject to the condition that the forests created therein remain subject to the forestry regime.
