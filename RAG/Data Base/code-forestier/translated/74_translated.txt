Subject to the provisions of Article 36 of this Code, any person who plows or cultivates land subject to the forest regime shall be punished with a fine ranging from 20 to 60 dinars for each hectare or part thereof that has been plowed or cultivated. (First paragraph amended by Law No. 28 of 2001 dated March 19, 2001). Any person who carries out land clearing operations in land subject to the forest regime without prior authorization shall be punished with a fine ranging from 500 to 5,000 dinars for each hectare of land cleared. (Amended by Law No. 13 of 2005 dated January 26, 2005). The fine shall not be less than the minimum amount if the area cleared, plowed, or cultivated is less than one hectare. Land that has been illegally cleared shall be replanted by the "Ministry responsible for forests" (1) at the expense of the offender. If the plowing occurred as a result of deforestation, only the fine applicable to clearing shall be applied. Offenders of the provisions of this chapter may be punished with imprisonment for a period ranging from 16 days to two months, and the maximum fine and imprisonment shall always be imposed in case of recidivism. The conditions for granting the licenses provided for in this chapter shall be determined by a decision of the Minister of Agriculture.
