**(Amended by Law No. 13 of 2005 dated January 26, 2005).** The Minister responsible for Forestry may enter into a settlement before the issuance of the final judgment concerning the offenses prescribed and punished by this Code. The settlement extinguishes the public action, after its execution. However, the settlement does not apply to cases of recidivism and serious crimes as provided for in Article 134 (bis) of this Code, nor to the benefit of settlement within the two years prior to the commission of the new offense. Subject to the provisions of the legislation concerning the administrative organization of the territory of the Republic, the Minister responsible for Forestry may delegate the authority to enter into the settlement to the head of the Forestry Administration and to the Regional Delegates for Agricultural Development, within the limits specified by his decision.
