In each region, a regional association of hunters is established, its organization governed by the existing legislation pertaining to associations. These associations aim to foster a spirit of discipline in land hunting among their members, contribute to deterring violations of land hunting regulations, and are also entrusted with the establishment and preparation of land hunting reserves, the maintenance and development of hunting resources, and the improvement of land hunting practices within their respective regions. These regional associations, along with specialized associations, are brought together under a National Federation of Hunting Associations, whose objectives are: 1) to coordinate the activities of hunting associations and contribute to unifying the general policies and programs related to hunting and its conservation. 2) to represent hunting associations on the "Advisory Committee for Land Hunting and Conservation of Hunting Resources."
