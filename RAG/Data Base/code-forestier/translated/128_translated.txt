If the matter pertains to animals, only a sufficient number may be sold to cover the amount of financial penalties incurred, as determined by the "Ministry responsible for forests" (1), unless the owner of the animals remains unknown. If a judgment of acquittal is issued, the owner has the right to recover the full purchase price. The relevant custodian shall be paid the expenses and fees for credit and sale in advance. The settlement of this will subsequently be carried out through a payment authorization from the budget. 

However, if the request is not made until after the seized animals have been sold, and the owner is subsequently acquitted by a court judgment, he is only entitled to the net proceeds of the sale, after deducting the expenses for credit, sale, and administrative handling, among others.
