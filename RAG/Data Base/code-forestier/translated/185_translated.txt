The right to hunt wild game in state forests and lands subject to the forest system may be exercised pursuant to a contract for reforestation or sand dune stabilization works. 

A contract is a legally binding agreement that obligates the contracting parties and defines their respective obligations and rights in relation to the specific transaction.

Such hunting may be conducted either under a personal license or through a permit, in accordance with the forms and conditions stipulated by a decision of the Minister of Agriculture.
