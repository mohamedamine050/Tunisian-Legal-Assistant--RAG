The use of trained dogs to capture game is permitted only after obtaining a special license, valid for one year, issued by the Minister responsible for Forests (1).  The issuance of this license requires the payment of a fee, determined by the State Property Collector, whose amount is specified in the annual decision regarding the opening and closing of the hunting season. The applicant must be a member of a regional hunting association.
