When it is decided to undertake works or projects for development, which due to their size or impact on the natural environment could potentially harm it, such works and projects must include a prior study of the potential repercussions resulting therefrom. This study is to be prepared by the competent institutions and shall allow for the assessment of the resulting outcomes. The aforementioned works or development projects can only be initiated upon the prior opinion of the Minister in charge of Forests. (The second paragraph was amended by Law No. 59 of 2009 dated July 20, 2009).  The methods for conducting the procedures related to the study of potential repercussions are regulated by decree.
