(Amended by Law No. 13 of 2005, dated January 26, 2005). - Hunting aims to achieve a balance between the existence of wild animals, plant cover, and human activities. For this purpose, hunters must practice this activity wisely and responsibly, preserving the balance and sustainability of ecosystems. Hunting is the searching, pursuing, shooting, and capturing of animals that live in the wild, known as game. The permitted means of hunting are hunting rifles, birds of prey, and trained dogs for capturing game. Hunting areas are fields specially prepared for the purpose of practicing hunting, in accordance with specifications that define their areas, the types of game native to them, and various preparation works to be carried out. It is also considered hunting, the taking of images of protected wild animals in their natural habitat using photographic and cinematic equipment. This type of hunting is regulated by a decision of the Minister responsible for forests.
