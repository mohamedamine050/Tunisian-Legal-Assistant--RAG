## English Translation:

Authorized personnel tasked with inspecting offenses related to wild hunting may conduct inspections to search for captured wild animals in public and private markets, within public or private transportation vehicles, in all types of inns, restaurants, hotels, and at food vendors.  They may also inspect, generally speaking, all locations where captured animals may be placed for the purpose of trade or consumption.

Any illegally possessed wild animal shall be seized. If alive, it shall be released. If not, it shall be delivered to a specialized institution caring for such animals until its release into the wild becomes possible. Alternatively, if dead, the animal shall be delivered to a research laboratory or scientific institute. In the event that this is impossible, the animal shall be destroyed.  Local administrative authorities shall be responsible for the execution of these procedures, based on the report documenting the seizure. The provisions of the third paragraph of Article 119, concerning house searches, shall apply.
