The Ministry responsible for forests, in order to ensure the sustainability of esparto grass plantations, their periodic renewal, and the provision of optimal production, while considering the diverse interests of the population, shall establish technical plans known as exploitation management plans. These plans shall specifically include the following:

a. An exploitation schedule based on the condition of each plantation, indicating the time interval between periodic harvesting operations and the quantity of products to be harvested each season.

b. Defining areas that have been intensively exploited and which require resting or prohibiting any exploitation for the duration necessary to complete their regeneration.

c. Defining areas where grazing is permitted for beneficiaries with usufruct rights (for communal esparto grass plantations) or for members of the group (for cooperative esparto grass plantations).  

Furthermore, this includes setting the maximum number of animals permitted for grazing in the designated grazing areas.

d. Measures to be taken for the revival or improvement of esparto grass plantations.
