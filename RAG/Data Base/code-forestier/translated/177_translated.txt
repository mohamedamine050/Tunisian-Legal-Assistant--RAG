Forest heritage constitutes a national wealth, and its protection and development are fundamental obligations of the national policy for economic and social development. Every citizen has a duty to contribute to its expansion and preservation.

**Note:** 
- The phrase "يُطلـق علـى كل فـرد يتمتـع بكافـة الحقـوق، سـواء أكانـت مدنيـة أو سياسـية أو اقتصاديـة أو اجتماعيـة أو ثقافيـة أو حقـوق التضامـن فـي الدولـة الـي ينتمـي إليهـا" is a definition of "citizen," which has been incorporated directly into the translation for clarity. 
- The repetition of "مواطن" has been removed as it was likely a typographical error.
