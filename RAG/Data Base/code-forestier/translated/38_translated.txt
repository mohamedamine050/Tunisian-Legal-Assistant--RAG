The right to use international forests is recognized only for Tunisians residing within those forests. As for citizens residing around those forests within a radius of five kilometers, who have actually exercised the aforementioned right of use in accordance with the conditions stipulated in the old code, they continue, in a transitional manner and for a period of five years from the date of the issuance of this law, to exercise the right of use as provided for in Article 36 above, except for the practice of agriculture in some plots of land within the state's forest ownership. The exercise of the right of use is subject to a prior permit granted by the "Ministry in charge of Forests" (1) for a period of five years, renewable upon the request of the beneficiary. The presentation of the permit becomes mandatory after two years from the date of issuance of this code. The conditions for granting these permits shall be determined by decree.
