If the accused raises a subsidiary claim regarding the record drawn up against him in the disputed property, the judge shall postpone consideration of the misdemeanor. The accused shall cease all actions, regardless of their nature, on the disputed land. Otherwise, the trial concerning the records drawn up shall proceed without delay. If the delay is due to civil reasons, wholly or partially based on possession by the accused or his heirs, the party who filed the complaint for the offense may maintain possession pursuant to the existing delay until a contrary decision is rendered by the court of first instance.
