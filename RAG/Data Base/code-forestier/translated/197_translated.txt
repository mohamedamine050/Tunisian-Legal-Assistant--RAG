The use of birds of prey for hunting is only permitted after obtaining a license valid for one year, issued by the Minister responsible for Forestry. No one can obtain a license for hunting with birds of prey or an extension of its validity unless they are a member of one of the associations approved for this purpose in accordance with Article 202 of this Code. The issuance or renewal of the validity of a hunting license using birds of prey requires the payment of a fee determined by the State Property Collector in the annual decision relating to the opening and closing of the wild game hunting season. The hunting license using birds of prey entitles its holder to capture and keep one bird of prey.
