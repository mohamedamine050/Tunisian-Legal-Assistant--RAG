The officers shall describe the instruments in their reports and determine their value when found with the offender. If these instruments are actually seized, they shall be deposited with the Court, along with a copy of the report. 

Every judgment of conviction shall state that the instruments are to be confiscated. If they were not actually seized, the judgment shall authorize their seizure or, if that is impossible, the payment of their value by the defendant.
