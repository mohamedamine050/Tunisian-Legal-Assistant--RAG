No modification is permissible to the established rule for the cutting of trees after the conclusion of the bidding or sale by auction.  Neither can any tree, piece of wood, or forest product be added to what has been sold. If this occurs, the successful bidder or the buyer by auction shall be penalized with a fine equal to double the value of the products not included in the transaction, in addition to the return of the products or their value, as well as any other possible fines and criminal prosecution.  Any agents who authorize or knowingly condone the addition of any quantity to concluded transactions shall be subject to the same fine, regardless of any investigations that may be initiated against them on grounds of bribery.
