The Ministry responsible for forests, with the aim of ensuring the sustainability and periodic renewal of the grasslands and optimizing their production while taking into account the diverse interests of the population, shall develop technical plans known as Exploitation Organization Plans, which shall include in particular the following:

a. An exploitation schedule based on the condition of each grassland, specifying the period between periodic harvests and the quantity of products to be harvested each season.

b. Identifying areas that have been intensively exploited and require rest or prohibition of any exploitation for the duration necessary to complete their regeneration.

c. Defining the areas where grazing is permitted for beneficiaries with usufruct rights (for communal grasslands) or for members of the group (for shared grasslands), as well as the maximum number of animals allowed to graze in the designated areas.

d. Measures to be taken for the revival or improvement of the grasslands.
