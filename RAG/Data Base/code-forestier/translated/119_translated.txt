The agents are authorized to seize animals that have caused the commission of the misdemeanor, as well as machines, vehicles, draft animals, and pack animals belonging to the offenders, and place them in the custody of a trustee. The agents may pursue stolen items from the forest and may conduct searches in any place, including vehicles where they anticipate the items being transported or deposited, as per credible information or testimonies. However, they may not enter homes unless accompanied by another agent of the judicial police officers mentioned in Chapter 10 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. These agents cannot refuse to assist forest agents when requested, and they are required to sign the report of the operations carried out in their presence.
