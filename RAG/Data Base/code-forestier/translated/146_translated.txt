The establishment of cadastral maps, which are to be initiated or completed, shall be carried out in such a way that distinguishes between dunes owned by the state, dunes owned by communities, and dunes owned by individuals. This shall also indicate the names of the apparent owners, or those presumed to be the owners.

Notice of the commencement of the establishment of cadastral maps to be registered shall be given in each area at least thirty days prior to the commencement thereof, by a decision of the Minister responsible for forests (1) which shall be posted in the headquarters of the governorate and the headquarters of the district in which those dunes are located.
