(The first paragraph was amended by Law No. 13 of 2005 dated January 26, 2005.) - In the event of committing the crime of fishing outside the fishing season stipulated in Article 167 of this Code, the Court shall order the confiscation of the confiscated fishing equipment, including the means of transportation and weapons, and their confiscation for the benefit of the State Treasury or their destruction if they are unfit for use. In addition to the aforementioned cases, the Court may, considering the circumstances of the misdemeanor, decide to confiscate the weapons, especially if it concerns the practice of hunting during a prohibited period. In the event that the actual confiscation of the objects ordered by the judgment does not take place, the perpetrators of the misdemeanor shall be sentenced to produce them or to pay their value as assessed by the judgment, provided that this value shall not be less than the real value for hunting weapons.
