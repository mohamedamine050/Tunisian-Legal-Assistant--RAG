Commencing from the date specified in Article 152 and within the same designated areas, the grazing of animals of any kind is strictly prohibited until it is proven that the plant cover that has established itself in the area, whether naturally or artificially, has reached a stage of growth that renders it capable of withstanding grazing. Grazing may continue if the "Ministry responsible for forests" deems that grazing does not conflict with the permanent establishment of the land.
