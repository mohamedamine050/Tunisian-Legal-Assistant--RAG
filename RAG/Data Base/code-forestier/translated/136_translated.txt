If the action is brought before the authority reviewing ownership within a period of two months, the judgment on the minutes shall be deferred until the dispute is resolved. Otherwise, the judgment on the violation shall be issued without delay. If forest products are exploited, the court of first instance where the defendant filed the subsidiary action as mentioned above shall order the securing of the value of those products, unless they have been seized, in which case Articles 127 and 128 of this Code shall apply. In the absence of such security, the claim shall not be admissible. The insured amount or the full sale price shall be paid to the beneficiary upon the separation of the subsidiary action.
