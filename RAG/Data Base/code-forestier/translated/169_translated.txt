If the perpetrators of offenses are masked or have concealed their identities or used violence against officers authorized to inspect violations of hunting regulations, or have threatened to seize their weapons, and the perpetrators of offenses whose identities have not been established, they shall be arrested and taken to the local administrative or judicial authority. A maximum fine, imprisonment, and the final revocation of the hunting license shall always be imposed against those who have used violence, regardless of the penalties provided for in the Criminal Code.
