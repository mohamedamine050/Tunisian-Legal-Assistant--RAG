**(Amended by Law No. 13 of 2005 dated January 26, 2005).**  Hunting aims to achieve balance between the existence of wild animals, plant cover, and human activities. For this purpose, hunters must practice this activity with prudence and responsibility, preserving the balance and sustainability of ecosystems. Hunting refers to the search, pursuit, shooting, and capture of animals living in the wild, known as game. The authorized hunting methods include hunting rifles, birds of prey, and trained dogs for capturing game. Hunting areas are fields specially prepared for the purpose of hunting, according to specifications that determine their size, the types of game residing there, and various development works to be carried out.  The taking of photographs and film footage of protected wild animals in their natural habitat is also considered hunting. This type of hunting is regulated by a decision of the Minister responsible for forests.
