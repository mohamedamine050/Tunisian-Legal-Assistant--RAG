The harvesting of alfalfa, as well as the operations related to its transport to the acceptance or baling site, shall be prohibited. This prohibition applies regardless of the landowners, outside of the harvesting season, the duration of which is fixed annually by a decree of the Minister of Agriculture. This decree also specifies the quantity of alfalfa that may be harvested.
