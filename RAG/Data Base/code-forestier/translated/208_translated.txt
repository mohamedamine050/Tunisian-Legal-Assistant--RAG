Such areas are characterized by fauna, flora, geological formations, and habitats of particular scientific, educational, recreational, or aesthetic value.

The concept of a "Natural Reserve" encompasses smaller areas that aim to preserve individual or collective species of natural fauna or flora, as well as their habitats. It also aims to protect migratory bird species of national or international importance.

The term "Picnic Forest" denotes an area or part of a forested area that holds significant tourism and recreational value.
