## English Translation:

The destruction of forests can only be challenged with respect to lands that are determined to be protected for the following purposes: 

1) **Prevention of soil erosion and protection of riverbanks**, except for the provisions of Chapter 55 of this Code.
2) **The presence of springs.**
3) **Defense of the territory.**
4) **Maintenance of public health.**
5) **The need to ensure the supply of timber, derived products, or specific plants to the country.**
6) **The preservation of endangered animals and plants.**

When the challenge to the destruction of forests becomes final, the landowner may claim compensation for the restriction on their property, unless the challenge is beneficial to them. The compensation shall be determined and paid according to the provisions of the legislation in force concerning temporary disposal.
