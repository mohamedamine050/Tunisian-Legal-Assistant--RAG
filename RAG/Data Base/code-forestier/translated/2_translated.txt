The Forestry System is a set of specific rules applicable to forests, halophyte vegetation, grazing lands, lands with a forest character, national parks, and natural reserves, as well as to wild animals and plants, with the aim of protecting, preserving, and sustainably managing them, while ensuring that beneficiaries exercise their legal rights.
