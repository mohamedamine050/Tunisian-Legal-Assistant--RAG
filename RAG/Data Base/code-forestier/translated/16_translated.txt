To preserve the state-owned forests, improve their income, ensure their continuity, and renew them periodically according to the seasons, the “Ministry in charge of Forests” (1) shall prepare a technical program called “Management Plan” for each forest, except for areas classified as national parks, natural reserves, and recreational forests, taking into account the legitimate interests of beneficiaries of usufruct rights. These management plans shall specifically include the following:

a) An exploitation plan based on the potential for timber production and other forest products, indicating the exploitation pattern and the quantity of products to be extracted within a specific period.
b) Defining areas where grazing is to be prohibited for the duration necessary for reforestation due to exploitation in those areas.
c) Defining areas that can be opened for grazing, specifying the maximum number of animals that can be admitted in these areas.
d) Measures to be taken for the renewal or improvement of plantations and pastures in the forests.
e) Creating reserve grazing areas to be used during times of drought.
