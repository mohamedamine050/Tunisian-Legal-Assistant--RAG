The Governor of the District may authorize the release of the seized property upon request from the owner of the seized items, subject to his responsibility and a guarantee determined by the judge. If no claim is made for the animals or seized items within a period of ten full days, commencing from the day of seizure, or if the applicant fails to provide a guarantee within the same period, the Ministry responsible for Forests shall submit a request to the Governor of the District. The Governor shall authorize, by a simple decision, the sale of the property by auction and shall determine the costs of the credit.
