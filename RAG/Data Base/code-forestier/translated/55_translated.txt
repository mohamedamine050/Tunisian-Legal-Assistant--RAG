The Ministry responsible for forests may suspend its objection to the clearing of forest land for the purpose of preserving a wooded reserve, carrying out soil conservation and rehabilitation works, or using the land for a specific purpose. Soil rehabilitation works become mandatory if the land falls within a public area designated for soil conservation and rehabilitation and its slope exceeds 20 percent. 

Any individual obtaining a clearing permit subject to conditions and who fails to fulfill the required obligations within a maximum period of one year from the date of the permit shall be subject to a fine ranging from 20 to 100 dinars per hectare. However, the fine shall not be less than the minimum amount if the land area is less than one hectare. Additionally, the Ministry responsible for forests may undertake the required works at the individual's expense.
