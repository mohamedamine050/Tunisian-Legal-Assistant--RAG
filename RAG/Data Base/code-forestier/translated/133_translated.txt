Individuals who cause misdemeanors through promises, threats, or instructions, or who knowingly provide the means for their commission, or who assist in acts that pave the way for, facilitate, or complete their occurrence, shall be punished with the same punishment as the original perpetrators. They shall be jointly liable for civil penalties, including damages and expenses.

**Note:** 

* "جنح" is translated as "misdemeanors" as it generally refers to less serious offenses.
* "الوعود أو بالتهديدات أو بالتعليمات" is translated as "promises, threats, or instructions" to maintain the structure and legal meaning.
* "يلزمون بالتضامن بينهم في الخطايا والتعويضات" is translated as "jointly liable for civil penalties, including damages and expenses" to convey the legal concept of shared liability. 
* The second part of the text is not a legal statement and therefore is not translated.
