Forests owned by private individuals are divided into two categories: 

1. **Forests subject to the forestry regime under Chapter IV of this Code**, to which the provisions relating to monitoring and conservation applied to state forests apply. The exploitation of these forests by their owners is subject to a prior license granted by the "Ministry in charge of Forests" (1), which specifies the terms of exploitation, in accordance with Chapter V of this Code.

2. **Forests not subject to the forestry regime**, where private individuals exercise all the rights arising from ownership, except for the exceptions provided in the following chapters. Furthermore, these forests are subject to the provisions relating to the forestry regime as set out in Chapters 93 to 101 of this Code (on the protection of forests from fire).
