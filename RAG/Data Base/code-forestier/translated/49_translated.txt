Any exploitation of forest products located on privately owned land not subject to the forestry regime must be notified to the "Ministry in charge of Forests" (1) three months prior to its commencement, provided that the exploited area is part of a wooded land exceeding four hectares in size, or if the forest trees to be cut are part of a windbreak or a plantation with rows of trees totaling at least one hundred trees. The administration shall inform the interested party within the aforementioned three months of the technical conditions for the exploitation in question and the date on which the exploitation may commence. The intended exploitation may only be challenged if the minimum conditions for exploitation specified in a specification document approved by a decision of the Minister of Agriculture are not met. (Paragraph three was amended by Law No. 28 of 2001 dated March 19, 2001). (Paragraph four was deleted by Section III of Law No. 28 of 2001 dated March 28, 2001).
