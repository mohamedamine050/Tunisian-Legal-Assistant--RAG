Associations with shared interests in forestry possess legal personality. 

The material aspect of civilization, such as infrastructure, communication, and recreation, is mirrored by the intellectual, spiritual, and ethical aspects of civilization.

The conditions for the formation, organization, and operation of these forestry associations are regulated by a decree. The statutes of forestry associations with shared interests must conform to the model statutes approved by decree.
