Those who have acquired property by purchase or exchange shall refrain from causing any damage to trees that were not subject to sale. Failure to do so shall be punishable by a fine ranging from twenty to one hundred dinars for each tree. The amount of the fine cannot be less than five times the value of the tree, calculated based on the price of the trees included in the cutting. Irrespective of the fine and restitution, whether in cash or in kind, as determined by the administration, the cut excluded trees, which can be presented, shall be seized.
