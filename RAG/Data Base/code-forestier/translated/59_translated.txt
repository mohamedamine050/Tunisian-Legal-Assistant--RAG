Each state has established a formal procedure for assembling individuals with relevant expertise from across the institution, forming a committee. This committee is tasked with identifying grazing lands as defined in the second and third categories of the former Article 58, with the purpose of subjecting them to the forest regime. The composition, responsibilities, and operating procedures of this committee are determined by decree.
