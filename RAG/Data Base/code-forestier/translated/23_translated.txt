If the bidder or purchaser does not provide the guarantee or a guarantor within the specified timeframe, or fails to pay the purchase price according to the terms and deadlines outlined in the tender documents, then their right shall be revoked by a decision of the Minister in charge of Forests(1). The administration shall then re-tender the property according to the procedures stipulated in Chapter 18 of this Code. The purchaser whose right has been revoked shall not be entitled to participate in the new tender. The bidder whose right has been revoked shall be legally obligated to pay the difference between the first sale price and the second sale price. They shall not be entitled to claim any increase in the price beyond what was agreed upon by the contracting parties, whether it exceeds or falls short of the value of the property, if this occurs. They may also be subject to a fine as provided for in Chapter 27 of this Code.
