The competent supervisory authority shall call upon the reference shareholder and the main shareholders in the capital of the non-resident financial services provider to provide him with the necessary support when it becomes clear that his situation warrants it. A reference shareholder shall be any shareholder or any group of shareholders pursuant to an express or implied agreement between them who holds, directly or indirectly, a percentage of the capital that gives him a majority of voting rights or enables him to control them. A main shareholder shall be any shareholder who holds a percentage equal to or exceeding five percent of the capital.

Subject to the provisions of Articles 124 to 137 of this Code concerning penalties applicable to authorized non-resident financial services providers, the support of the aforementioned shareholders may be requested in all cases where the non-resident financial services provider does not comply with the prudent conduct and adequacy of its own resources during a period and at levels that expose the continuity of its business and the interests of its clients to danger.
