- **Exemption from income tax** on salaries and wages paid to them by the non-resident institution they belong to, regardless of the place of payment. In return, they shall be subject to a **presumptive tax contribution** of 20% of their gross salary, including bonuses, benefits, and in-kind benefits.

- **Exemption from customs duties and other charges** due upon the importation of personal belongings and one tourist car per employee.
