The Tunis Stock Exchange shall be responsible for the listing and delisting of financial instruments and products in the non-resident section of the Exchange and their eligibility for trading in this section, unless the Financial Market Authority objects.

Contrary to the provisions of Article 87 of Law No. 117 of 1994 dated November 14, 1994, relating to the reorganization of the financial market, non-resident companies whose registered office is located in Tunisia, whose bonds have been listed in the non-resident section, as well as the shareholders in their capital, are subject to the obligations stipulated by the legislative and regulatory texts governing the financial market.

Companies whose registered office is located outside Tunisia, whose bonds are listed in the non-resident section of the Exchange within the framework of dual listing, as well as the shareholders in their capital, are subject to obligations related to periodic and continuous financial disclosure and exceeding shareholding thresholds.

Shareholders are exempted from declaring exceeding shareholding thresholds if they have done so with the regulatory authority of the company's registered office.

The forms and procedures for the implementation of this provision shall be determined by an order from the Financial Market Authority.
