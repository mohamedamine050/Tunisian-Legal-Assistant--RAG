Non-resident financial service providers shall effect their payments, such as those related to the acquisition of goods and services in Tunisia, taxes, fees, and dividends distributed to resident partners, through foreign accounts denominated in convertible dinars. To cover their ordinary administrative and operational expenses in Tunisia, they are authorized to hold a balance of dinars in cash, which must be provided by debiting their foreign accounts denominated in convertible dinars. However, non-resident credit institutions with banking status may effect these payments through their dinar revenues, limited to the amount of income and revenues generated with residents.
