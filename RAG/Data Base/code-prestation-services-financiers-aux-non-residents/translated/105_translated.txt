Non-resident investment service providers are required to take all reasonable measures to avoid conflicts of interest.

**Conflict of Interest**

A conflict of interest arises when personal interests conflict with professional duties or responsibilities.  A conflict of interest arises between service providers or persons under their authority or working on their behalf, or any person directly or indirectly related to them by a supervisory relationship, on the one hand, and their clients on the other hand, or between clients when providing an investment service or a related service, both services being provided.  In situations where the measures taken do not reasonably guarantee the avoidance of harm to client interests, service providers must clearly inform their clients of the nature or source of the conflict of interest before acting on their behalf.

Non-resident investment service providers must establish rules and procedures that enable:

* Ensuring that persons under their authority or working on their behalf respect the terms and conditions under which these persons may carry out transactions on their own behalf;
* Monitoring the leakage and use of inside information as defined in the legislation regulating the financial market, taking into account the provisions of Article 94 of this Code, and considering the activities of the groups to which they belong and their organization.
