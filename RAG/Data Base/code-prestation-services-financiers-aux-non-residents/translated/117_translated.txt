## English Translation:

Officers appointed by the competent authority for field supervision are authorized to perform the following acts in the performance of their duties:

* **Entering professional premises during regular business hours;**
* **Seizing bonds and documents that appear to them to be forged or non-compliant with the specifications and regulations in force, even if they are in the hands of the holder. In this case, the seized bonds and documents remain under their custody in accordance with the procedures laid down in the Code of Criminal Procedure;**
* **Conducting all necessary inspections, requesting immediate production, without the need for relocation, of documents and evidence, regardless of their source, as well as the necessary registers for investigations and inspections, and obtaining copies thereof;**
* **Obtaining, against receipt, documents and evidence referred to in the previous paragraph, necessary for the performance of their duties or for the continuation of the investigation;**
* **Summoning and hearing all persons able to provide information relevant to their mission.**

Investigations are documented in a report prepared and signed by investigating officers affiliated with the Financial Market Authority or the Central Bank of Tunisia, as the case may be, or by both authorities in the event of joint investigations. Before proceeding to draw up the report, they must provide their identity and qualification documents.

The report must contain the names and surnames of the officers who prepared it, the seal of the institution to which they belong, and a statement of the words of the person who was heard or their refusal to make a statement.

The person who was heard has the right to be assisted by a counsel of their choice during the investigation and the drafting of the report.

The person who was heard is required to sign the report. If it is drawn up in their absence, or if they refuse to sign it while present, this shall be noted in the report.

The report must also state the date, place, and nature of the inspections or investigations carried out, and state that the person concerned by the report was informed of the date and place of the drafting of the report, unless they were caught in the act.  They must also be summoned by registered letter with acknowledgment of receipt, with notification of delivery, or by any other means leaving a written record.
