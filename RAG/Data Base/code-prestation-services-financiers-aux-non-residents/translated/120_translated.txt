If a non-resident financial services provider breaches the rules of good professional conduct, the competent supervisory authority may:

Issue a warning to the members of the board of directors, the members of the collective management body, the managers, or the agents of the institution, after giving them the opportunity to provide explanations.

The Central Bank of Tunisia or the Financial Market Authority, as the case may be, may issue, if the situation of the non-resident financial services provider justifies it, an order to the members of its board of directors, the members of its collective management body, its managers, or its agents, requiring in particular:

- An increase in capital,
- The prohibition of any distribution of profits,
- The establishment of reserves.

The members of the board of directors, the members of the collective management body, the managers, or the agents of the relevant financial services provider shall submit to the Governor of the Central Bank of Tunisia or the Chairman of the Financial Market Authority, as the case may be, within two months from the date of notification of the order, a rescue plan accompanied by an external audit report detailing the measures taken and the expected measures, as well as a timetable for its implementation.
