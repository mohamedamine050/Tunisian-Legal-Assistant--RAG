A temporary administrator of a non-resident credit institution may not purchase or sell real estate property, shares, or investments without prior authorization from the Central Bank of Tunisia. 

The temporary administrator of a non-resident financial services provider must submit to the Central Bank of Tunisia or the Financial Market Authority, as the case may be, a report every three months on the activities it has completed as well as on the financial status of the relevant service provider. 

Within a period not exceeding one year from the date of their appointment, the temporary administrator must submit to these authorities a report specifying the nature, reasons, and magnitude of any difficulties faced by the non-resident financial services provider, as well as the measures that could potentially achieve its rescue, or, if this is not feasible, proof of insolvency and a proposal for its bankruptcy. 

In such a case, the provisions of the Commercial Code and the provisions of the Commercial Companies Code regarding bankruptcy shall apply, regardless of the provisions of the law relating to the rescue of institutions experiencing economic difficulties.  It may be possible, depending on the situation, for the Minister of Finance, the Governor of the Central Bank of Tunisia, or the President of the Financial Market Authority to propose a name for the bankruptcy trustee in the bankruptcy ruling.
