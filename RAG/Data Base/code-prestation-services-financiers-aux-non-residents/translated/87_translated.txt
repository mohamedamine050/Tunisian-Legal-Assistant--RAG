In the scenario where the withdrawal of the license results in liquidation, the Minister of Finance, upon the proposal of the Governor of the Central Bank of Tunisia if it concerns a non-resident lending institution, or the President of the Financial Markets Authority if it concerns a non-resident investment institution or a non-resident financial portfolio management company, shall appoint a liquidator. The liquidator shall be chosen from among the certified accountants registered with the Board of Accountants of Tunisia. The liquidator shall not be among the shareholders in the capital of the relevant financial service provider or have a professional relationship with it. The appointment decision shall confer upon the liquidator the necessary powers to manage and dispose of the relevant service provider. It shall also specify the terms and deadlines for liquidation and the liquidator's fee. The liquidation decision shall not terminate the duties of the auditors. The provisions of the general law concerning the liquidation of companies shall apply unless they conflict with the provisions of this code.
