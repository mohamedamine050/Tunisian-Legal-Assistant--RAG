The extraordinary general meeting that decides on the modification, merger, or division of the board of directors or the collective management body is granted the authority to evaluate the company's assets and determine the exchange ratios on the date it sets. These operations are carried out under the supervision of the auditor without the need to appoint a qualified expert by the judge.
