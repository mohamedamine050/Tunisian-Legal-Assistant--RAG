Investment companies with variable capital subject to relaxed investment rules are shell companies. The minimum amount of capital of an investment company with variable capital subject to relaxed investment rules at the time of establishment cannot be less than the equivalent of 15 million dinars in convertible currency. At all times, the capital must be equal to the company's net assets less the funds intended for distribution.

The minimum amount of capital below which the repurchase of shares is not permitted as provided for in Article 15 of this Code cannot be less than the equivalent of 7.5 million dinars in convertible currency. The board of directors or collective management body shall dissolve the company if its capital remains below the equivalent of 15 million dinars in convertible currency for a period of ninety days. 

The constituent contracts of investment companies with variable capital subject to relaxed investment rules must expressly state that the capital can be increased by issuing new shares or decreased by the company repurchasing its own shares at the request of their holders. This change in capital can be made without amending the constituent contract and without presenting this change to the general meeting of shareholders or carrying out the deposit and publication procedures provided for in the legislation currently in force for commercial companies. The constituent contracts must also state that each shareholder can, at any time, obtain the repurchase of their shares by the company, except in the case provided for in paragraph four of this Article.
