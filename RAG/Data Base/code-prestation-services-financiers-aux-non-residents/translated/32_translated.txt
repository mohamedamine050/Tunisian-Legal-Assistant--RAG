Shares of investment companies with variable capital, subject to fully relaxed investment rules upon subscription, are issued without preemptive rights. The value of the contribution is verified in the form of financial bonds by the auditor who, under his responsibility, prepares a report, a form of information receipt, formulated in a semi-final form to be accessible in the future. The auditor submits this report to the company's general assembly and to the Capital Market Authority. The ordinary general assembly is convened and its deliberations are valid regardless of the percentage of capital represented. The extraordinary general assembly is also convened upon the second call, and its deliberations are valid regardless of the percentage of capital represented.
