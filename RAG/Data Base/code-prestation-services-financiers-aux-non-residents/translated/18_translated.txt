The constituent contracts or internal regulations of collective investment institutions in securities subject to relaxed investment rules may provide that the Board of Directors, the Collective Management Body, or the Manager may temporarily suspend repurchase operations as well as issuance operations if exceptional circumstances warrant it or if the interests of the shareholders or holders of units so dictate, after consulting with the auditor. These contracts or regulations shall specify the conditions for making the suspension decision and shall stipulate the obligation to inform the shareholders or unit holders in accordance with procedures that shall be determined. Further, the Capital Markets Authority shall regulate the other circumstances and conditions that may be stipulated, where necessary, in the constituent contract of a variable capital investment company subject to relaxed investment rules or the internal regulations of a collective investment fund subject to relaxed investment rules, for the temporary or permanent suspension of the issuance of shares or units.  Additionally, constituent contracts or internal regulations may stipulate, subject to conditions regulated by the Capital Markets Authority, the possibility of limiting the repurchase of shares or units, at the date of determining the liquidation value, to a portion of the units or shares issued by the institution.  The Capital Markets Authority must be immediately notified of any decision to suspend or limit repurchases, along with the reasons for such decision.
