Upon appointment, and within a period not exceeding twelve months, extendable for a further period not exceeding twelve months, the liquidator shall take the necessary steps to:

- Dispose of the assets and liabilities of the relevant service provider in their entirety,
- Dispose of some of the assets of the relevant service provider in favor of licensed service provider(s) with them assuming some of the liabilities,
- Liquidate the assets of the relevant service provider.

In doing so, the liquidator shall take the most appropriate measures to preserve the value of the institution's assets and protect the interests of depositors, investors, and other creditors, after obtaining the opinion of the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank of Tunisia whenever it concerns a non-resident credit institution, and the Financial Market Authority whenever it concerns a non-resident investment institution or a company managing non-resident financial portfolios.

For this purpose, the liquidator may:

- Continue, suspend, or terminate any operation,
- Borrow with or without the guarantee of the assets of the relevant service provider,
- Appoint an expert or experts as consultants when necessary,
- File or pursue legal actions on behalf of the relevant service provider,
- Declare, if necessary, the cessation of debt payments by the relevant service provider, in which case, the provisions of the Commercial Code and the provisions of the Commercial Companies Code relating to bankruptcy shall apply, regardless of the provisions of the law concerning the rescue of companies facing economic difficulties. However, depending on the circumstances, the Minister of Finance, the Governor of the Central Bank of Tunisia, or the President of the Financial Market Authority may propose the name of a bankruptcy trustee(s) for the bankruptcy judgment.

The liquidator shall submit to the Central Bank of Tunisia, and where applicable to the Financial Market Authority if it concerns a non-resident credit institution, or to the Financial Market Authority if it concerns a non-resident investment institution or a company managing non-resident financial portfolios, a report on the progress of the liquidation every three months, and a detailed report on the liquidation upon completion of his/her duties.
