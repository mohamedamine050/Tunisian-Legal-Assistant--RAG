It shall be mandatory upon every judgment, ruling, or written decision issued by the court resolving a legal or factual issue, which has become final and conclusive, convicting the managers or depositors of the mutual investment fund subject to relaxed investment rules, in accordance with the penal provisions of this code, to terminate their duties and deprive them of their eligibility to perform these duties. The court where the lawsuit is filed, pursuant to the liability stipulated in Article 43 of this code, may, upon the request of a shareholder, declare the removal of the managers or depositors of the fund from their duties. The depositor may also request the court to remove the managers of the fund, and the auditor must be notified of such a request. In all three of these cases, the court shall appoint a temporary manager until new managers are appointed, or, if this is not possible, until liquidation.
