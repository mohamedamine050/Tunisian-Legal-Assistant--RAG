## English Translation:

The license may be withdrawn upon a request from the non-resident financial service provider addressed to the Central Bank of Tunisia, if the provider has the status of a non-resident credit institution, or to the Financial Market Authority if the provider has the status of a non-resident investment institution or a non-resident portfolio management company. 

The license may also be withdrawn on the initiative of the Minister of Finance or on the initiative of the Financial Market Authority:

1. If the license has not been used within a maximum period of twelve consecutive months from the date of its grant,

2. If the financial service provider has ceased to operate for a period of six consecutive months,

3. If the financial service provider no longer meets the conditions upon which the license was granted,

4. If the financial service provider obtained the license through false declarations or by any other unlawful means,

5. If the financial service provider no longer demonstrates that its assets exceed its liabilities to third parties by an amount equal to the minimum capital or minimum grant,

6. If the reasons upon which a decision to suspend the license was based have not been removed within six months from the date of the decision, if this concerns non-resident investment institutions or non-resident portfolio management companies.
