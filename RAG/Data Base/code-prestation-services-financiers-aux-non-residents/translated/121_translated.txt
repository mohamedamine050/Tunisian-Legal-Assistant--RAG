The Governor of the Central Bank of Tunisia, if it concerns a non-resident credit institution, or the Chairman of the Financial Market Authority, if it concerns a non-resident investment institution or a non-resident financial portfolio management company, may, after hearing the representative of the non-resident financial services provider concerned, appointed by the group to act on its behalf, issue a decision to appoint a provisional administrator.

The appointment of the provisional administrator shall be made:

1. At the request of the managers if they find that they are no longer able to perform their duties normally; or
2. On the initiative of the Central Bank of Tunisia or the Financial Market Authority, after consulting the professional association of non-resident financial services providers:

- If it is established that the practices of the financial services provider concerned may lead to a failure to meet its debts in normal circumstances, or may cause serious harm to the interests of depositors or investors;

- If it is established that members of the Board of Directors, members of the Supervisory Board, members of the collective management body, or managers of the financial services provider concerned are involved in illegal operations or forgery;

- If the capital adequacy ratio of the non-resident credit institution concerned is less than 25 percent of the minimum ratio set by the Central Bank of Tunisia, or less than 50 percent of that ratio and the institution has not satisfactorily responded within two months to an order from the Central Bank of Tunisia to submit a rescue plan;

- If one of the penalties set out in numbers 4, 5 and 6 of Article 128 of this Code is imposed on members of the Board of Directors, members of the collective management body, or members of the Supervisory Board of the non-resident financial services provider, its managers or its agents;

- Or if the non-resident investment services provider, other than a non-resident credit institution, remains in violation of the prudent conduct rules for a period exceeding 4 months.

The decision to appoint a provisional administrator confers the necessary powers to manage, administer, and represent the non-resident financial services provider concerned to third parties. The appointment order shall set the remuneration of the provisional administrator.

The Central Bank of Tunisia shall notify the Financial Market Authority of the decision to appoint the provisional administrator if the financial services provider is a non-resident bank authorized to provide investment services.
