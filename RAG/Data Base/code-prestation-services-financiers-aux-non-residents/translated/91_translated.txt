**[The Arabic text repeats "الجمعية" three times.  It seems like a typo, so I've removed it.]**

This association shall ensure the maintenance of the reputation of the Tunisian financial market. Its purpose is to represent the collective interests of non-resident financial service providers, particularly before the public authorities; to inform its members and the public; to study and provide opinions on any matter of common interest to the profession; to prepare recommendations in this regard; and, where appropriate, to facilitate the conditions for the practice of the profession of financial service providers, to organize services of common interest, and to manage them. It shall also establish a code of ethics for the profession, binding on all its members, and shall contribute to ensuring its respect. The basic law of the professional association of non-resident financial service providers shall be subject to prior approval by the Minister of Finance after obtaining the opinion of the Governor of the Central Bank of Tunisia and the President of the Financial Market Authority.
