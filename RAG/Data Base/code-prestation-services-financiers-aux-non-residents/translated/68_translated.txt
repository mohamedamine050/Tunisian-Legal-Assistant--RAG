For the purpose of determining whether an activity requires a license as a non-resident lending institution or as a non-resident investment service provider, the Tunisian Central Bank or the Financial Market Authority, as the case may be, may require the relevant institution to provide all necessary information and conduct all on-site investigations. This includes requiring the submission of accounting records, correspondence, contracts, and, in general, all documents deemed necessary for the performance of its task.

The relevant institution providing financial services without a license may be liquidated after hearing its representative:

- By a decision of the Minister of Finance, based on a proposal from the Tunisian Central Bank, if it is engaged in the activity of a non-resident lending institution, or

- By a decision of the Financial Market Authority, if it is engaged in the activity of a non-resident investment institution or the activity of a non-resident portfolio management company.
