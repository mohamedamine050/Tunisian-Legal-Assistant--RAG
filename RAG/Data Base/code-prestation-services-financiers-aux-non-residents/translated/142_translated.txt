Services rendered to residents, as well as the crops and profits generated from these services, are subject to the current tax legislation. To determine the profits arising from transactions with residents and the profits arising from transactions with non-residents, costs are allocated based on the income and revenue generated from transactions with residents and the income and revenue generated from transactions with non-residents.
