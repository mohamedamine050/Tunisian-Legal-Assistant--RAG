Non-resident investment service providers shall take all reasonable steps in executing orders to enable their clients to obtain the best results, taking into account the price of the transaction, its cost, the speed of its completion, its feasibility, and its settlement, as well as the size and nature of the orders, and other considerations relevant to the execution of such orders. However, in the event of specific instructions issued by the client, the service providers shall execute the orders in accordance with those instructions and shall indicate this by including the phrase "client-determined transaction" on the document carrying the client's order. For the purpose of complying with the provisions of the preceding paragraph of this chapter, non-resident investment service providers shall establish and implement a policy in the field of order execution that includes, for each type of instrument, information on the various systems within which their clients' orders are executed, and on the factors that led them to choose a particular execution system.
