Non-resident lending institutions having the status of a bank are authorized to accept, from residents, in accordance with the regulations determined by the Central Bank of Tunisia, funds in dinars, regardless of their duration and form, provided that the funds collected by each non-resident lending institution do not exceed their financing in foreign currency to residents in the form of long-term loans and their contributions in foreign currency to the capital of resident institutions, excluding contributions to the capital of lending institutions as defined in the law relating to lending institutions.

Also taken into account, within the above-mentioned limits, are funds arising from:

- The proceeds of subscriptions to the capital of companies,
- Payments made pending the payment of installments of loans concluded with the aforementioned service providers,
- Payments made pending the completion of foreign trade operations.

Non-resident lending institutions having the status of a bank must at all times be able to mobilize sufficient foreign currency resources to meet withdrawal demands from depositors. They cannot in any event resort to refinancing or other facilities with the Central Bank of Tunisia, which can take any measure that ensures the security of depositors.
