Non-resident lending institutions are authorized to operate as non-resident banks or non-resident financial institutions by a decision of the Minister of Finance, based on a report from the Central Bank of Tunisia. The request for authorization is submitted to the Central Bank of Tunisia, which reviews it in conjunction with the Financial Market Authority if the requested authorization also includes the provision of investment services by the proposed non-resident lending institution. The Central Bank of Tunisia notifies all concerned parties of the Minister of Finance's decision. The agreement stipulated in Article 114 of this Code defines the procedures for cooperation between the Central Bank of Tunisia and the Financial Market Authority regarding the review of authorization requests.
