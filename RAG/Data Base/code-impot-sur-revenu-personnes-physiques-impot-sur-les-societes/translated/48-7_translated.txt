(Repealed and replaced by Article 29 of Law No. 56 of 2018, dated December 27, 2018).  To determine the tax due on resident or established entities in Tunisia that have a dependent relationship with other entities or that monitor other entities belonging to the same group, within the meaning of this Article, profits indirectly transferred to the aforementioned entities, whether by increasing or decreasing the prices of transactions used or by any other method, shall be included in the results of these entities.

The profits indirectly transferred shall be determined by comparison with the profits that could have been achieved in the absence of any dependent or monitoring relationship.

The condition relating to dependence or monitoring stipulated above shall not be required if profits are transferred to companies resident or established in a country or territory with a preferential tax system within the meaning of Article 14, number 12 of this Code.

Entities shall be considered to have dependent or monitoring relationships if:

a. One entity directly or indirectly through another person owns more than 50% of the capital or voting rights in another entity, or actually exercises decision-making power; or

b. The aforementioned entities are subject to the control of the same entity or the same person under the conditions stipulated in sub-paragraph "a" of this Article.
