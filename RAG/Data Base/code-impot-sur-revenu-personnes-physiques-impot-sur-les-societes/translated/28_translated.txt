I. Gross income from properties, whether wholly or partially leased, consists of the sum of gross receipts received by the owner, plus the amount of expenses normally borne by the owner and for which the lessee is liable according to the agreement, minus the amount of expenses borne by the owner on behalf of the lessee.

Gross receipts include, in particular, receipts derived from the leasing of suspension rights, the lease of ownership rights, or exploitation rights.

II. To determine the net income of built properties, 20% is deducted from the gross income for management expenses, security and insurance costs, depreciation, as well as justified repair and maintenance expenses, and the property tax paid on the rental value. (Amended by Article 21-1, Law No. 53 of 2015, dated December 25, 2015).

The net income of unbuilt leased properties is estimated by deducting from the gross income the amount of justified expenses incurred in generating the income, as well as the property tax paid on the unbuilt land.


III. The provisions of Articles 10 to 20 of this Code apply to persons who prove that they maintain accounting records in accordance with the accounting legislation for enterprises. (Amended by Article 76, Law No. 88 of 1997, dated December 29, 1997).

IV. (Amended by Article 47-2, Law No. 54 of 2013, dated December 30, 2013) For the application of the provisions of paragraphs 2 and 3 of Article 27 of this Code, the taxable capital gain is equal to the difference between the sale price of the aforementioned properties and rights, as declared or as increased following tax audits, on the one hand, and the acquisition cost or the cost of donation or construction, including the value of the land, as declared or as increased following tax audits, plus the amount of justified expenses and 10% for each year of ownership, on the other hand.

The cost price is determined, with regard to transfers of usufruct and ownership rights, on the basis of a portion of the property value, in accordance with the schedule provided for in Article 38 of the Code of Registration and Stamp Duties.

To enable beneficiaries of state lands that have lost their agricultural character to obtain a certificate of release of rights prior to the final transfer of these lands, the capital gain is calculated on the basis of the value determined by a state property expert. (Amended by Article 107, Law No. 122 of 1992, dated December 1992, and by Article 5 of Law No. 73 of 1998, dated August 4, 1998, relating to the simplification of tax procedures and the reduction of tax rates).

The cost price is determined, with regard to donations, compensation, and inherited properties, on the basis of the values declared in the donation or compensation deeds or in the declarations filed for transfer upon death. (Amended by Article 60-22, Law No. 90 of 2004, dated December 31, 2004).

The cost price is determined, with regard to transfers of donated properties between ascendants and descendants and between spouses, on the basis of their value on the date of acquisition by the original donor. In this case, the ownership period is calculated from the date of acquisition by the original donor. (Added by Article 4 of Law No. 69 of 2006, dated October 28, 2006, relating to the exemption of donations between ascendants and descendants and between spouses from the proportional registration duty, and amended by Article 47-3, Law No. 54 of 2013, dated December 30, 2013).
