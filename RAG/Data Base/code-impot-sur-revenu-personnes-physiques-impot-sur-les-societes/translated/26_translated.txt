I. To determine the amount of net income, the following deductions are subtracted from the gross amount of income referred to in Article 25 of this Code, including in-kind benefits:

- Compulsory deductions made by the lessor for the purpose of forming income, salaries, pensions, or for covering compulsory social security systems.

- Professional expenses, estimated at 10% of the remaining amount after deducting these compulsory deductions, without exceeding 2,000 dinars annually. (Completed by Article 14-2 of Law No. 78 of 2016 dated December 2016)

II. Pensions and retirement income benefit from a deduction equal to 25% of their gross amount for the purpose of calculating the tax thereon.

III. In-kind benefits are assessed according to their real value; however, individuals who legally benefit from a housing allowance and who occupy housing owned by the employer without benefiting from the allowance, are subject to tax based on the amount of the allowance they should have received.

The same procedure applies when a company car is used for personal purposes.
