Every person having the status of head of household is subject to income tax according to their own income and the income of their children considered under their guardianship for tax calculation.

A head of household is considered to be:

- The husband,
- The divorced person who has children under their guardianship,
- The widower,
- The adopter.

However, the wife is considered the head of household:

1. When she proves that the husband had no source of income during the year preceding the tax year.
2. When she remarries and retains guardianship of her children from a previous marriage.

Contrary to the provisions of the preceding articles, the head of household may request the taxation of their minor children who earn income, regardless of its type.
