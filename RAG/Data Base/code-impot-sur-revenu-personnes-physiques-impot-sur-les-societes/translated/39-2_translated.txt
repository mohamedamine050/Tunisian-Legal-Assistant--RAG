Added by Article 21 of Law No. 101 of 2002, amended by Article 27-4 of Law No. 66 of 2017 dated December 18, 2017. - Subject to the provisions of Article 12 bis of Law No. 114 of 1989 dated December 30, 1989, concerning the issuance of the tax code on the income of individuals and corporate tax, the amounts deposited by individuals in investment savings accounts opened with the Tunisian National Savings Fund or with a lending institution having the status of a bank are deducted from the income tax base for the year of deposit, provided that this deduction does not exceed 50,000 dinars annually (amended by Article 27-1 of Law No. 66 of 2017 dated December 18, 2017).

The amounts deposited in the accounts referred to in the above paragraph, and the surpluses or profits resulting therefrom, are frozen and cannot be withdrawn except for the purpose of creating new individual projects by the account holder or their children, which are eligible for the tax benefits provided for in the legislation in force, or for use in subscribing to the original capital of institutions that grant the right to deduct reinvested income or profits in accordance with the legislation in force concerning the encouragement of investments.

The deposited amounts, including surpluses or profits resulting therefrom, in investment savings accounts must be used by December 31 of the year following the end of the savings period. Any withdrawal of funds for a reason other than the creation of the projects mentioned in this article, or any project creation after the expiry of the aforementioned period, is subject to the payment of the tax due on the deposited amounts, including surpluses or profits resulting therefrom, which have not been paid; penalties calculated in accordance with the tax legislation in force are added.  However, late payment penalties are not imposed if the deposited funds are withdrawn due to unforeseen events as defined by the legislation in force.

The use of funds deposited in investment savings accounts for the creation of projects or for subscription to the capital of institutions does not grant the right to the deduction provided for in the tax legislation concerning the reinvestment of income.

The conditions for opening and managing investment savings accounts, the manner of their management, and the savings period are determined by a decision of the Minister of Finance.
