Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 44, thirdly, of this Code, the annual income tax on industrial and commercial profits, in the event of disposal by taxpayers under the estimated assessment system, of their business assets, shall be calculated based on the income tax schedule set forth in paragraph 1 of Article 44 of this Code.  However, the tax due on this basis shall not exceed the estimated tax due based on the turnover.  The taxable profit in this case shall be determined on the basis of the difference between receipts and expenses relating to the year in question, to which shall be added the capital gain resulting from the disposal of the business asset.
