Subject to the provisions of Articles 12 and 12 bis of Law No. 114 of 1989, dated December 30, 1989, relating to the issuance of the Income Tax Code for individuals and corporate tax, the excess of a company's assets over its liabilities is wholly deductible, within the limits of income or profit.  The company's capital is included among its debts at the end of the fiscal year.  Re-invested income or profits in subscribing to the original capital or increasing it for entities established by young graduates under forty years of age at the date of the company's formation, and who bear personal and permanent responsibility for managing the project (amended by Article 21-1 of Law No. 66 of 2017, dated December 18, 2017), are tax-exempt.

Benefitting from the aforementioned deduction requires meeting the conditions stipulated in Article 75 of this Code.
