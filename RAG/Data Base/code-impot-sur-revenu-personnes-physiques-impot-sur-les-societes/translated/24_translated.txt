Profit consists of the excess of a company's assets over its liabilities, incorporating the company's capital within its outstanding debts at the end of the fiscal year.  Net agricultural profit or profit from fishing is the positive difference between total receipts realized during the calendar year and the expenses incurred during the same year, considering the impact of inventories.

The provisions of Articles 10 to 20 of this Code apply to persons who demonstrate that they maintain accounting records in accordance with the accounting legislation for businesses (amended by Article 76 of Law No. 88 of 1997 dated December 29, 1997).

However, in the case of failure to maintain accounting records, farmers and fishermen are subject to an estimated tax, determined after consultation with experts in the field, taking into account the nature of activities and the relevant jurisdictions.
