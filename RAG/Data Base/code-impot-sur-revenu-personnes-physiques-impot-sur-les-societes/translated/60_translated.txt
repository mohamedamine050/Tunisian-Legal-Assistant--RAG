If the declarations relating to the determination of corporate tax for companies legally subject to an audit by an accountant are submitted before the annual general meeting of partners at which the accounts of the year in question are approved, or before the accounts of the year in question are approved by an accountant for single-person limited liability companies, they are considered provisional and may be amended within fifteen days following the date of approval or certification of the accounts, as the case may be, and by the twenty-fifth day of the third month following the latest deadline set in the previous sub-paragraph.
