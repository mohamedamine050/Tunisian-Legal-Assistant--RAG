The estimated tax is considered a credit against the value-added tax in the real system and against the income tax levied on industrial and commercial profits.  It includes the tax on entities with an industrial, commercial, or professional nature. However, it is deductible from the income tax or from the value-added tax for persons who are included in the real system following a tax audit.
