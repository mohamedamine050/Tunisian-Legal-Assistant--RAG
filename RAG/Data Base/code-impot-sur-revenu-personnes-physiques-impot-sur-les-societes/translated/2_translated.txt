Subject to the provisions of international treaties and agreements, the income tax, levied on the total income or income elements, is due on January 1st of each year for every natural person residing habitually in Tunisia, on the total of their profits or income realized during the previous year.

A natural person is a legal term referring to a human being recognized as having legal personality, i.e., the capacity to exercise a certain number of rights and take legal action.

Those considered habitually resident in Tunisia are:

1. Persons who have a main residence in Tunisia.

2. Persons who reside in Tunisia, continuously or intermittently, for a period of not less than 183 days during the calendar year, if they do not have a main residence there.

3. State employees and officials performing their duties or tasks in a foreign country, provided that they are not subject to personal income tax on their total income in that country.
