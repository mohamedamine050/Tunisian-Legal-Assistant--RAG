The gross net income constituting the tax base consists of the positive difference between gross receipts, including the value of gains and in-kind benefits, and the burdens and expenses incurred in obtaining and retaining the income.

This gross net income consists of the sum of the net incomes determined individually, according to the rules specific to each of the following types of income:

- Industrial and commercial profits,
- Profits from non-commercial professions,
- Profits from agricultural activities and fishing,
- Salaries, wages, grants, pensions, and annuities,
- Real estate income,
- Income from securities and transferable capital,
- Other income.

The income determined in this manner takes into account the loss incurred by one type of income, as shown by accounting compliant with the accounting legislation for institutions. If the gross income is insufficient to cover the entire loss, the remaining amount is deducted successively from the gross income of the following years, up to the fifth year inclusive (*).

The deduction does not include losses resulting from the deduction of income or profits according to the tax legislation in force. (Added by Article 37-2 of Finance Act No. 1 of 2012, dated May 16, 2012).

Losses that have not been deducted under the heading of the years recorded for income and subsequent to the year of recording the losses are not accepted for deduction, up to the limit of the realized income. (Amended by Article 31 of Finance Act No. 101 of 2002, dated December 17, 2002).
