If among the registered creditors there is a creditor who has the right to file a suit for rescission and wishes to do so, they must file their suit within twenty days of being notified, including all listed creditors. Failure to do so will result in the forfeiture of their right to file. The liquidation procedures shall commence upon the creditor's filing of the rescission suit. They are not subject to any form of appeal unless the creditor retracts their rescission suit or it is rejected by the Court.
