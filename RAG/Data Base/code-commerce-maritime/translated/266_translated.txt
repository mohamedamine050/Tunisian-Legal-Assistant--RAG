**English Translation:**

Damages sustained by the vessel, the cargo, or both, due to perils of the sea or other perils, including damages arising from sinking a vessel on fire to extinguish the fire that erupted on board, constitute general average losses. However, damages caused by the fire itself to the cargo or the vessel are not considered general average losses.
