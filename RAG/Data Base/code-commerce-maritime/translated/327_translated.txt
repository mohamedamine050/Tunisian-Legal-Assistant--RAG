## Insurance

**Contract**

The contract is a legally binding agreement that obligates the contracting parties and defines their obligations and rights with respect to the specific transaction. By this contract, the insurer undertakes to pay the insured or the beneficiary a sum of money, a periodic income, or any other monetary compensation in the event of the occurrence of the insured event, in return for premiums or other financial payments made by the insured to the insurer.

In the case of a ship, the insurer guarantees it without interruption wherever it may be and within the limits of the voyage, duration, and navigation stipulated in the insurance contract.
