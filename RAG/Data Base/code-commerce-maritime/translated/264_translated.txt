**English Translation:**

Losses that are considered "general average" include items thrown overboard from the vessel, as well as any damages sustained by the ship and its cargo as a result of such actions. The process of jettisoning cargo begins with the least essential items, those that are heaviest and have the lowest value. However, cargo discarded at sea is only deemed "general average" if it is disposed of in accordance with established commercial practice.
