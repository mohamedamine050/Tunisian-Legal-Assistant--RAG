Every registered or preferred creditor, opposing the sale, shall have the right to request, within twenty days from the date of the notification of the request by the new owner to sell the ship or a share thereof by public auction before the Court. This request shall be made by offering an increase in the purchase price agreed upon by the contracting parties, whether the increase exceeds or falls short of the sale price by ten percent. The creditor may submit the offer personally or through a representative acting in solidarity with him, and shall provide a guarantor for the payment of the purchase price agreed upon by the contracting parties, whether the increase exceeds or falls short of the sale price, and for the costs. Otherwise, the proceedings shall be null and void.
