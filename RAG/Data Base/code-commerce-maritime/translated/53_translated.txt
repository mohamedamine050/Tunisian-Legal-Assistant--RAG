Mechanically propelled vessels required to keep a logbook must also maintain an engine logbook.  This logbook shall record the quantity of fuel taken on board at the commencement of each voyage, the vessel's daily fuel consumption, all matters relating to the operation or maintenance of the engine, and any damage or technical malfunction that may occur. The logbook must accurately record the hours during which the engine is engaged in various maneuvers, particularly during entry into and departure from ports. The rules governing the numbering, signing, and deposit of the vessel's logbook shall apply to the engine logbook.
