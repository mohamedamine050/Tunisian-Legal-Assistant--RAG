A charter party is a contract entered into for the duration necessary to undertake the voyage or voyages contemplated. The contract may specify the type of goods to be shipped and their quantity, as well as the identity of the shipper. The freight may be determined in a lump sum or according to the quantity shipped. The lessee may be authorized to manage the ship's commercial affairs, and the lessor may undertake only the duties of a carrier or some of them.
