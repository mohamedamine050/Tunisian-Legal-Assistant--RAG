If multiple contracts of insurance are entered into without fraud, covering the same risks, and the total amount insured exceeds the value of the insured objects, the insured party shall exercise their rights against the different insurers in accordance with the priority of the dates of the contracts. The insured party claiming compensation for the damage sustained shall declare any insurance contracts they are aware of.

**Contract:** A contract is a legally binding agreement that obligates the contracting parties and defines their obligations and rights concerning the specific transaction. In an insurance contract, the insurer undertakes to pay the insured party or beneficiary a sum of money, a regular income, or any other financial compensation in the event of the occurrence of the insured event, in exchange for premiums or other financial payments made by the insured party to the insurer.

Any person who intentionally claims insurance compensation contrary to the priority of the dates of insurance contracts shall be punished as stipulated in Article 291 of the Penal Code. For the purposes of this article, anyone who violates its provisions, whether they are a tenant or entrusted with the management or operation of maritime exploitation institutions, regardless of their legal form, shall be considered an insured party and punished accordingly. These institutions shall be held civilly liable, and in particular, jointly and severally liable with the violators for the amount of fines, costs, and penalties.

If one of the insurers is designated as an agent for the insurance contract, the lawsuit can be filed against or by them alone, acting as an agent for the other insurers.
