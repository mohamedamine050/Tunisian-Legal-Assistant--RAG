If an insurance contract includes coverage for the risks of war, the insurer undertakes to indemnify the insured or the beneficiary for any damage or loss to the insured property resulting from acts of hostility, retaliatory acts, seizure, confiscation, detention, compulsion, or oppression by any government or any authority, whether recognized or unrecognized, and resulting from mines or other military instruments, even if there is no declaration of war or the war has ended. 

The contract is a legally binding agreement that obliges the contracting parties and defines their obligations and rights with respect to the specific transaction. 

The insurer undertakes to pay the insured or the beneficiary a sum of money, a regular income, or any other financial compensation in the event of the occurrence of the insured risk, in exchange for premiums or any other financial payment made by the insured to the insurer.
