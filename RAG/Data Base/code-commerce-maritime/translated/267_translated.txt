If a vessel is intentionally driven ashore and the circumstances conclusively demonstrate that had this measure not been taken, the vessel would have inevitably run aground or collided with rocks, then any damage or loss sustained by the vessel, cargo, or freight, or any combination thereof, as a result of such grounding shall not be considered general average. However, any damage or loss incurred to the vessel during the process of refloating it shall be considered general average. In all other instances where a vessel is intentionally driven ashore for the purpose of general safety, any damage or loss resulting therefrom shall be considered general average.
