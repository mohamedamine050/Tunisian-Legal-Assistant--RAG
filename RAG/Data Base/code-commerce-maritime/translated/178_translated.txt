In the event of force majeure that does not prevent the ship from sailing or continuing its journey except temporarily, the agreements remain in effect and there is no ground for penalty due to the delay. During the ship's stoppage, the lessee may request the unloading of his cargo at his own expense, provided that he reships it or pays the lessor the loss of the freight charge.
