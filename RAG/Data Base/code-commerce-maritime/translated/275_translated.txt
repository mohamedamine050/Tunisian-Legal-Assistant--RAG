If a vessel enters a port or place or remains in a port or place for the reasons set forth in Article 271, the wages and expenses of the master, officers, and crew, as well as the fuel and provisions consumed during the extension of the voyage from the beginning of the stoppage and deviation in the voyage to the time when the vessel becomes or should have become fit to resume its normal operations or continue its voyage, shall be considered as general average. However, if the vessel is deemed unseaworthy or if it discontinues its first voyage, the period of excessive stoppage shall be deemed not to exceed the day on which the vessel was deemed unseaworthy or on which it discontinued the voyage or the day on which unloading is completed if the unloading has not been completed. Fuel and provisions consumed during the period of excessive stoppage, as well as the expenses of the vessel's stay in that port, shall be considered general average, except for the costs of repairs that are not to be considered general average. Wages that are to be considered general average include all amounts paid to the master, officers, and crew, as well as all subsidiary expenses and charges due to them from the outfitter pursuant to applicable laws and agreements. While amounts paid to them for work during overtime to preserve the vessel or to carry out repairs shall not be considered general average, such amounts are nevertheless considered expenses that are partially compensated and that save expenses that would have been paid and considered general average if the work had not been done during overtime.
