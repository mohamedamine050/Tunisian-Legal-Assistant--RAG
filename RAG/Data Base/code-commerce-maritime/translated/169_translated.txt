**(Amended by Law No. 22 of 1998 dated March 16, 1998)** The stevedore is the person entrusted with the handling of goods transported by sea. This handling involves loading and unloading operations on the quay, at the terminals, in the port or harbor, or at sea. The stevedore is responsible for sorting, loading, stacking, unstacking, and unloading the goods. They take or place the goods on the quay, in a warehouse, or in a covered or uncovered space, and physically deliver them to their owners. They operate on behalf of the maritime carrier, who is solely obligated to deliver the goods. However, depending on the circumstances, the stevedore may become the agent of the shipper or consignee by a clause included in the charter party or bill of lading. They are required to issue a detailed inventory of the goods in a proc√®s-verbal (report) to those concerned. This inventory serves as evidence for or against the stevedore in their relations with the maritime carrier. This inventory must, upon request, specify the transport for which it was prepared. The stevedore enjoys the right of lien granted to a cargo superintendent.
