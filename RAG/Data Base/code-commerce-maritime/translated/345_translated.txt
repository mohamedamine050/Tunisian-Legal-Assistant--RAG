Contract

The contract is a legally binding agreement that obligates the contracting parties and defines their obligations and rights in relation to the specific transaction.
 Under this contract, the insurer undertakes to pay the insured or the beneficiary a sum of money, a regular income, or any other monetary compensation in the event of the occurrence of the insured event, in exchange for premiums or any other monetary payment made by the insured to the insurer.
 Insurance on goods may be effected either under a special contract that only applies to a single voyage or under a contract known as a running policy or a subscription policy.
