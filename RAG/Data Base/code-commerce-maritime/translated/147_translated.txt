## Responsibility

**Responsibility**

The obligation to respond to a person's actions before the law, or to compensate for damages caused.

**Carriers**

A carrier is liable for any damage, defects, or loss to goods during transportation, whether national or international, except in cases of fraud.

**Fraud**

Fraud refers to the deception committed with the intent to force a person to enter into a legal transaction, or to induce them to contract under more detrimental conditions.

The carrier's liability shall not exceed one hundred Dinars for each package or unit normally used as the basis for transporting goods, unless the shipper declares the nature and value of the goods before shipment. This declaration shall be included in the shipping document and shall constitute evidence against the carrier unless the carrier proves otherwise. If the carrier disputes the validity of the declaration at the time of its issuance, it may include in the shipping document its justified reservations regarding each package. In such cases, the burden of proof of the actual value shall fall upon the sender or recipient of the goods. The amount of one hundred Dinars may be modified by decree.
