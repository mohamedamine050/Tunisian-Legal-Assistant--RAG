**Amended by Law No. 22 of 1998 dated March 16, 1998**

The ship's agent is an agent, a person acting on behalf of another person, representing the maritime carrier in places where the carrier does not have an agency or branch.  The ship's agent enters into all contracts for the supply of the ship, accepts goods for shipment, issues bills of lading and cargo manifests, and other documents, and deals with stevedores.  The ship's agent accepts on behalf of the maritime carrier or the master all papers, summonses, or notifications relating to them, and manages their interests in the best way possible.  The ship's agent is not liable to shippers and consignees except in the case of personal fault.
