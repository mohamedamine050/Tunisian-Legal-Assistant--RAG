A change in a ship's nationality has no impact on the rights of the mortgagee.

A mortgage is a formal contract by which a creditor acquires a real right over a property designated to satisfy his debt, allowing him to take precedence over ordinary creditors and subsequent creditors in the order of priority in recovering his right from the proceeds of that property, regardless of whose possession it may be in.

The aforementioned rights remain subject to the law under which they were acquired until their expiry.
