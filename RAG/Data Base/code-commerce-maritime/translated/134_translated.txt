If the total amount of bodily injury damages exceeds forty dinars per gross ton, then each person holding a debt arising from such damages may, in order to recover their rights, claim a share in the amount of twenty-four dinars per gross ton stipulated in Article 1 of Chapter 133. If there are persons holding debts arising from material damages, they shall share in the distribution of the amount of twenty-four dinars per gross ton along with the creditors whose debts arise from bodily injury damages, claiming the difference between the full amount of their debt and what they have already received from the fine assessed at forty dinars per gross ton.
