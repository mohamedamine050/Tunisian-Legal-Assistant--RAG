If there is a discrepancy between the original and a copy of the bill of lading, the negotiable copy shall prevail. If there is a discrepancy between the lease agreement prepared by [the parties] and the bill of lading, the lease agreement shall govern the relationship between the lessor and the lessee. However, for the relationship between the maritime carrier and the shipper, only the bill of lading shall be considered, unless it expressly refers to the lease agreement prepared by [the parties] and includes the necessary provisions from it.
