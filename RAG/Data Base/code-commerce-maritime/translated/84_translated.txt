If the mortgage does not pertain to a share of the ship, the creditor is not permitted to seize and sell anything other than that specific share. However, if the mortgage covers more than half of the ship, the creditor may, after the seizure, sell the entire ship.  The creditor must invite the co-owners to attend this sale. In all forms of shared ownership, mortgages placed during the joint ownership by one or more owners on a share of the ship remain in effect after the division of the ship. In the case of a sale transaction, the rights of creditors whose mortgage only covers a share of the ship sold by their debtor are limited to the right of priority over the portion of the purchase price relating to the mortgaged share, provided that the agreed-upon price is not higher or lower than the actual value of the sold property. Similarly, any costs incurred for each share in the ownership of the ship are automatically transferred to the share of the purchase price that represents the value of the ship's share.
