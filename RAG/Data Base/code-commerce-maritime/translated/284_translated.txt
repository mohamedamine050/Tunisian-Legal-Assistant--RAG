Contribution to general average loss is the ratio between the contributory group and the contributing group. The contributory group includes all debts arising from sacrifices made and considered as general average loss. The contributing group includes the net real value, estimated on the day the joint venture terminates, of the saved goods and the goods sacrificed and considered as general average loss, as well as the value of the vessel after deducting any amount customarily deducted from the freight charges. Postal parcels, passengers' baggage, and personal belongings for which no bill of lading has been issued are not subject to any form of contribution to general average loss.
