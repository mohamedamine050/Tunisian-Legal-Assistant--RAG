If the trading or unloading expenses referred to in the preceding section are considered to be among the general average losses, then the costs of reloading and reshipping the vessel, as well as all warehousing expenses, including those required by every contract, shall be considered general average losses. 

A contract is a legally binding agreement that obligates the contracting parties and defines their respective obligations and rights regarding the specific transaction. 

An insurance contract reasonably entered into shall be considered a general average loss. However, if the vessel is deemed unseaworthy or if it ceases its initial voyage, then the warehousing expenses shall not be considered general average losses. The costs of reloading and reshipping shall be considered general average losses only until the vessel is deemed seaworthy or until the day the voyage is interrupted. If either of these events occurs on the day the unloading is completed, then the aforementioned expenses shall be considered general average losses up to the day the unloading is completed.
