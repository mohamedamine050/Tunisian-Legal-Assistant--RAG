The carrier shall be responsible for any damage, defect, or loss sustained by the goods due to the carrier's failure to exercise reasonable care, unless the carrier proves that such damage, defect, or loss resulted from:

1. The acts, negligence, or errors of the master, crew, pilot, or other employees of the carrier relating to navigation or the management of the vessel.
2. Latent defects in the vessel.
3. An act of God or force majeure.
4. A strike, lockout, or work stoppage or obstruction for any reason, whether partial or total.
5. A defect inherent in the goods or a defect in their packaging or marking.
6. Loss in the volume or weight of the goods during the voyage, taking into account their nature, the length of the voyage, the fluctuations in weather, and customary allowances.
7. Assistance, salvage, or attempted assistance or salvage, or a change in the vessel's course for such purposes.
8. Fire.
9. A change in the vessel's course, if justified, after obtaining the opinion of the officers or the master of the vessel.

However, in all of these excepted cases, the shipper shall have the right to prove that the damage or loss resulted from the fault of the carrier or the fault of its employees, except in the case of the first exception listed in this article.
