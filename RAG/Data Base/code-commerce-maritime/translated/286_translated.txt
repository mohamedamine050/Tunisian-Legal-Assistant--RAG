The contributions made by each interested party shall not exceed the limits of their legal obligation. The outfitter, however, shall not be obligated to pay more than the value of the ship, estimated summarily as determined in Article 133. Any interested party in the cargo may be relieved from the obligation to contribute by abandoning the contributed funds before receiving them. In the event of the insolvency of any party involved in the maritime voyage or their insurer, their share shall be distributed among the remaining parties.
