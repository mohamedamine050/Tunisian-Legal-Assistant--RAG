A maritime mortgage shall not be created except by a contract. It shall not be valid unless it is entered into with respect to a specific ship or ships and for the purpose of securing a specified amount.

The official mortgage is a contract by which the creditor acquires a real right over a property dedicated to the payment of his debt, entitling him to precedence over ordinary creditors and creditors ranking after him in the order of priority in the recovery of his right from the proceeds of that property, regardless of its holder.
