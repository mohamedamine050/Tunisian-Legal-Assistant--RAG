Any condition, whether the carriage is national or international, which contravenes the provisions of Chapters I, II, III, and IV of this Title, or seeks to reduce the carrierâ€™s liability below the limits stipulated therein, or to increase the grounds for legal exemption from liability, or to shift the burden of proof contrary to the provisions of the law, shall be null and void. Any condition by which the carrier is relieved of liability arising from insurance, a contract whereby the insurer undertakes to pay the insured or the beneficiary a sum of money, a periodic income, or any other pecuniary compensation in the event of the occurrence of the insured event, in return for premiums or any other financial payment made by the insured to the insurer, with respect to the goods, or any similar condition, shall be considered a condition of exemption. 

This Chapter shall not apply to the carriage of goods loaded on the deck of the vessel with the written consent of the shipper, or to the carriage of live animals. However, it shall apply in the case of carriage on the deck of the vessel, even if not authorized by the shipper, if such carriage is customary or if it concerns coastal navigation.
