The effect of the insurance contract continues.
The contract is a legally binding agreement that obliges the contracting parties and defines their obligations and rights in relation to the specific transaction.
By virtue of it, the insurer undertakes to pay the insured or the beneficiary a sum of money, a periodic payment, or any other financial compensation in the event of the occurrence of the insured event, in return for premiums or any other financial payment made by the insured to the insurer.
This applies under the same conditions as those under which the contract was concluded, even if there is a compulsory change in the course, route, or vessel. If, however, the change in the journey or route is voluntary, the insurer shall guarantee the risks that are proven to have occurred during the agreed portion of the journey.
