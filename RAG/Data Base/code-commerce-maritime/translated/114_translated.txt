An action for annulment or a claim for ownership shall be brought, by a writ from an attorney to an attorney, at least ten days before the appointed day for the decision to be made. The writ shall specify the date of the hearing before the Real Estate Registry Division of the court that ruled on the sale and the documents supporting the annulment or claim of ownership. Failure to do so will result in the forfeiture of the right to bring such an action. The attorney of the claimant shall respond to this with a report within five days. Bringing these actions does not suspend the sale proceedings. 

A ruling can only be appealed to the Court of Cassation, and the appeal must be filed within five days of the ruling being issued. The deadlines provided in Articles 185 and 186 of the Code of Civil Procedure are reduced by half. 

An action for annulment brought after the deadline mentioned in the first paragraph is considered void. An action for ownership brought after that deadline, or after the decision is made, shall automatically be transformed into an objection to the delivery of the proceeds from the sale, to be considered when the price of the property is distributed.
