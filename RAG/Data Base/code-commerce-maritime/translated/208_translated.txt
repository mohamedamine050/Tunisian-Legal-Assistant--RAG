A bill of lading may be issued to the bearer, to order, or to a named person. If the bill of lading is to the bearer, the goods may be delivered to anyone who holds the bill of lading. If the bill of lading is to order, it is transferable by endorsement, even in blank. If the bill of lading is to a named person, it may be transferred to another named person by way of assignment. This assignment may be stated on the bill of lading itself or by a separate instrument, without the need for informing the carrier. Prohibiting the negotiation of a bill of lading must be explicitly stated in a prominent manner on the document itself.
