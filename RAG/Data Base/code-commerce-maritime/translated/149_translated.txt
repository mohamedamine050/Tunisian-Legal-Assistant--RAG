Combustible, explosive, or hazardous goods that the carrier or its agent refuses to ship, or whose nature is unknown, may be unloaded, damaged, or rendered harmless from the vessel at any time and place, without any penalty being incurred by the shipper, who shall, in addition, be liable for all damages and expenses arising from the shipment of these goods. If the carrier is aware of the nature of such goods when it agrees to ship them, it shall not be entitled to unload, damage, or render them harmless unless they pose a risk to the vessel or cargo, and no penalty shall be imposed except for general average losses, if any.
