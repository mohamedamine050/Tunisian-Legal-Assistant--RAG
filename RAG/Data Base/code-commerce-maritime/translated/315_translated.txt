Any increase in the severity of risks during the term of the insurance contract shall result in the termination of the insurance contract.

**Insurance Contract**

An insurance contract is a legally binding agreement that obliges the contracting parties and defines their obligations and rights concerning the specific transaction. Under this contract, the insurer undertakes to pay the insured or the beneficiary a sum of money, a periodic income, or any other financial compensation in the event of the occurrence of the insured event, in exchange for premiums or any other financial payment made by the insured to the insurer.

If the insurer is not notified of the increase within five days of the insured becoming aware of it, and if the increase is not due to the actions of the insured, the insurance contract shall continue in effect. However, if the increase in the severity of risks is due to the actions of the insured, the insurer has the option of either terminating the contract immediately while retaining the right to the premium or demanding an increase in the premium proportionate to the increase in the severity of risks.
