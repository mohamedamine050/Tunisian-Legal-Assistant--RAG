The description of the goods delivered to the carrier in the bill of lading, including their apparent condition and packaging, must contain a precise statement of the marks, and as the case may be, the number of packages, articles, or goods, including their quantity, nature, and weight, all based on the written information provided by the sender before shipment. All general or customary reservations are deemed null and void. The marks must be sufficient to identify the goods and placed in a manner that allows them to be read easily throughout the journey. The carrier has the right to refuse to record the sender's information regarding the marks, number, quantity, nature, and weight of the goods in the bill of lading if it has serious reasons to doubt its veracity or if it is unable to verify it by ordinary means. However, in such cases, the carrier must state specifically and in detail the reasons for its doubt or the impossibility of verification. Otherwise, it cannot oppose its right to record. In that case, the burden of proof of damage, defect, or deficiency falls on the sender or the consignee if the reasons were serious or the impossibility was genuine.
