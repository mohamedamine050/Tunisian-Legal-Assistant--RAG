A carrier may not be exempted from all or part of its liability for failure to fulfill its obligations, for fulfilling them in a deficient manner, or for delay in fulfilling them, except if it is proven that this was due to force majeure or fault attributable to the passenger. Any clause contradicting this provision shall be considered null and void.
