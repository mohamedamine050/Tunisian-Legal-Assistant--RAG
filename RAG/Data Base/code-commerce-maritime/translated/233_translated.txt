A sale "by a specific ship" or "by a ship to be designated later" or "upon safe arrival" is a type of sale of goods by delivery, in which the seller is obliged to immediately or within a specific timeframe, designate the ship upon which the goods were or will be loaded. Any deficiency, loss, or defect occurring during the voyage shall result in the termination of the sale, to the extent of the damage, without any reciprocal compensation to the seller or reimbursement to the buyer. The buyer shall bear the consequences of the ship's delay. Acceptance of the goods occurs at the port of unloading unless otherwise agreed upon.
