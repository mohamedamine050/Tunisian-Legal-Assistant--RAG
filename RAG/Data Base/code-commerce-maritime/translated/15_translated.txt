Whoever constructs a vessel on behalf of another person remains its owner until its ownership is transferred to that person or to another, unless there is a contrary agreement recorded in the vessel's registration book. The maker shall inform the maritime authority of the region where the construction takes place of every vessel construction undertaken, pursuant to a written declaration signed by him and authenticated by his signature, in accordance with applicable legislation. If the construction concerns a fishing vessel, the declaration referred to in the second paragraph of this chapter shall be accompanied by the maker's license issued to him in accordance with applicable legislation.
