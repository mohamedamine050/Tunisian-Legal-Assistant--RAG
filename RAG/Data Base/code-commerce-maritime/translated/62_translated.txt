The captain is appointed and dismissed by the shipowner. The dismissal of the captain does not depend on the intervention of the maritime authority or on the licenses required by the procedures of public law for dismissal. The dismissed captain must comply with the orders of the shipowner and leave the ship immediately when required. These provisions do not apply to coastal navigation.
