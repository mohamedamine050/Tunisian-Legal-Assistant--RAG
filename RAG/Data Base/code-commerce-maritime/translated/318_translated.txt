If the insurance contract is concluded, it constitutes a legally binding agreement that obligates the contracting parties and defines their respective obligations and rights concerning the specific transaction.
 
In this contract, the insurer undertakes to pay the insured or the beneficiary a sum of money, a regular income, or any other financial compensation in case of the occurrence of the insured event, in exchange for premiums or any other financial payment made by the insured to the insurer.
 
If the insured sum exceeds the value of the insured object, the insurer may request its annulment, even if he was satisfied with that value, as long as it is proven that there was misrepresentation or fraud. In this scenario, the insurer remains entitled to the entire premium.
