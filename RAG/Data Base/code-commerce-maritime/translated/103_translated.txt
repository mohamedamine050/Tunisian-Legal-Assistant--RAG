If the ship charter includes the management of its navigation and the charterer is solely responsible for a maritime debt related to that ship, the claimant may proceed with an attachment.

This attachment, which empowers a creditor holding an enforceable instrument to place the tangible movable property in the possession of his debtor under the authority of the court, may be levied on the ship or any other vessel owned by the charterer. 

However, an attachment, which empowers a creditor holding an enforceable instrument to place the tangible movable property in the possession of his debtor under the authority of the court, may not be levied on any other ship belonging to the owner for that maritime debt. 

The provisions of the above paragraph also apply in all cases where a non-owner is liable for a maritime debt.
