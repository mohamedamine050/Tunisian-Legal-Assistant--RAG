The forfeiture of the ship does not result in the termination of any lease agreements previously entered into by the owner. The owner is obligated to disclose the lease agreements that they have entered into, and the buyer is bound, together with the previous owner, to respect the current lease agreements, or those of which they were aware, or which are registered in the Ship Registration Book.
