If a writ of attachment, which empowers a creditor holding an enforceable instrument to place the movable property in the possession of his debtor under the jurisdiction of the court, has been issued against a vessel, and the shipowner provides a guarantee that meets the maximum limit of the limited liability, then all creditors who are able to challenge that limited liability benefit from that guarantee, and the writ of attachment is lifted by virtue thereof. 

If another writ of attachment, which empowers a creditor holding an enforceable instrument to place the movable property in the possession of his debtor under the jurisdiction of the court, is executed against the vessel, the judge may decide to lift the attachment if the shipowner, within the court's jurisdiction, does not object and proves that he has provided a guarantee meeting the maximum limit of the limited liability, that the guarantee is satisfactory, that it is certain that the creditor will benefit from it, and that the matter concerns a debt arising from the same event that led to the formation of the limited liability fund. 

If the guarantee is less than the amount of the limited liability fund, or if multiple requests are made for the guarantee, the consequences of this will be settled by agreement between the parties or by the judge, to avoid exceeding the limit of liability. If multiple creditors are pursuing claims in courts of different countries, the shipowner may request a consolidation of all claims and debts in each court to avoid exceeding the limit of his liability.
