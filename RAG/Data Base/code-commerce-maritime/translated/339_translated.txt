If the insurance contract includes a clause concerning the notification of war, then it is permissible for the insured to abandon the ship if it is seized, detained, or stopped by an order of the authorities and the insured has not recovered control of it within four months. This period of four months shall commence from the date of notification of the incident to the insurer by the insured.

Notification, for the purposes of this clause, is deemed to be the signing of the notice by the defendant, or his agent in the presence of the relevant official, on the notice paper, or on the statement of claim for appearance at the designated time.
