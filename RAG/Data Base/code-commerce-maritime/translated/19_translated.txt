After negotiation, the management of the ship may be entrusted, by a majority of the partners, to an agent selected from among them or from others. The agent shall perform all the usual management tasks, and in particular, shall enter into all contracts for the transportation and insurance of the ship. The agent shall legally represent all the partners before the courts in all matters relating to the equipping and operation of the ship. However, the agent may not choose the captain, mortgage the ship, or undertake major repairs without the consent of a majority of the partners. The agent may not engage in any act of disposal. If the partners limit the powers of the agent, such limitation shall not be invoked against third parties who have contracted with the agent in good faith. The agent is liable to the partners for his errors and must submit a report on his activities. Each partner may discuss the agent's accounts, even after they have been approved by a majority of the partners, without reservation.
