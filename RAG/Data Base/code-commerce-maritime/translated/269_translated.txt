## Damage

**Damage** 

[1] Harm inflicted in violation of the law that affects a person's body, mental or psychological health, honor, property, or reputation. [2] The loss or damage inflicted on property, the deprivation of comfort, or the impairment of physical well-being, reputation, or the like. - In crimes and quasi-crimes, damage refers to the actual loss suffered by the claimant and the necessary expenses that he was or will be compelled to incur to repair the consequences of the act committed against him, as well as what he was deprived of in the ordinary course of the consequences of this act.

Damage resulting from the operation of machinery and boilers of a stranded ship in a dangerous situation, and arising from the efforts exerted to refloat it, shall be considered general average loss if it is proven that the purpose of such operation was indeed to refloat the ship for the sake of public safety, despite the expectation of such damage. However, if the ship is afloat, the damage or defect caused by the operation of the machinery and boilers, including damage or defect resulting from the release of the machinery or any similar means, shall not be considered general average loss under any circumstances.
