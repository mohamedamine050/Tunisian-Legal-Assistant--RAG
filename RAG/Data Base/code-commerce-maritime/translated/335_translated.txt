If the insurance contract is a binding legal agreement that obligates the contracting parties and defines their obligations and rights regarding the specific transaction. By this contract, the insurer undertakes to pay the insured or the beneficiary a sum of money, a regular income, or any other financial compensation in the event of the occurrence of the insured event, in exchange for premiums or any other financial payment made by the insured to the insurer for a specific period. The entire agreed-upon amount for the duration of the contract belongs to the insurer in the event of the insured peril or abandonment. If the insurer is not responsible for these perils, then the amount related to specific risks is only entitled to the period between the date of assuming the risks and the date of the event causing the peril or abandonment.
