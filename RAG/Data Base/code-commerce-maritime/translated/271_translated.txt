If a ship enters a port or place of refuge, or returns to its port of loading, due to an accident, sacrifice, or other exceptional circumstances that necessitated the adoption of such a measure for the sake of public safety, the expenses incurred in entering that port or place shall be considered as general average losses, as shall the expenses incurred in the departure of the ship from that port or place, along with its entire original cargo or a portion thereof. If the ship is at a port or place of refuge where repair is impossible, and it is transported to another port or place where it can be repaired, the provisions of this chapter shall apply to that second port or place. The provisions of Chapter 277 shall not apply to any extension of the duration of the voyage due to such movement.
