An insurance contract is not valid unless it is in writing, in the form of an insurance policy.

An insurance contract is a legally binding agreement that obligates the contracting parties and defines their obligations and rights with regard to the specific transaction. Under this contract, the insurer undertakes to pay the insured or the beneficiary a sum of money, a regular income, or any other financial compensation in the event of the occurrence of the insured event, in return for premiums or any other financial payment made by the insured to the insurer.

Any additions to the original contract, amendments to it, or applications thereof shall be drafted in the same form and shall be called a policy attachment. Prior to signing the policy or the attachment, a cover note can be issued to confirm the obligations of both the insurer and the insured to each other.
