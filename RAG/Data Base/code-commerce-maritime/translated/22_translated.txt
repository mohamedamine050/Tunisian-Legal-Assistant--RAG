The sale of the vessel is a transaction that may only be requested by a majority vote as stipulated in Article 18, unless there is an agreement to the contrary, and the court having jurisdiction over the vessel's home port shall rule on the matter. The sale shall be conducted by the court according to the forms relating to the forced sale of vessels, unless the partners agree on other forms, with all of them being summoned to the session. If there is no bidder, the opening price shall be reduced in the same session without delay to another session until a willing buyer comes forward.
