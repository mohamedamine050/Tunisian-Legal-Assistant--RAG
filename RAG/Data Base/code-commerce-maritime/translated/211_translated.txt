Upon delivery of the goods, a bill of lading may be issued under the heading "For Shipment" or "Received for Shipment," both of which attest to the delivery of the goods to the maritime carrier and their placement under its care, as a bill of lading under the heading "Shipped" can be issued attesting to its occurrence. In the first two instances, the shipper subsequently receives a "Shipped" bill of lading, or the aforementioned documents state that they will be converted into a valid bill of lading. If this is not done, these documents shall be considered as "Shipped" bills of lading, contrary to the provisions of the last paragraph of Article 209.
