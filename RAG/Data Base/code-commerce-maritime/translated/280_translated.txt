The amount that may be considered as general average loss due to damage shall be determined as follows:

[1] Injury caused in violation of the law affecting a personâ€™s body, mental or psychological health, reputation, property, or honor. [2] Loss or damage inflicted upon property, deprivation of comfort, harm to physical well-being, reputation, etc.  - In crimes and quasi-crimes, the loss is the actual loss suffered by the claimant and the necessary expenses that he was or will be obliged to incur to repair the consequences of the act that caused him harm. It also includes the benefits he was deprived of within the normal scope of the consequences of the act.

The damage to the ship, its machinery, and equipment, if repaired or compensated for, is the actual and reasonable value expended to complete the repair, taking into account the deduction for the difference between the old and the new, according to international custom, as well as considering the value of the wreckage. If repairs are not carried out, reasonable compensation shall be granted for the resulting loss, not exceeding the amount that would have been spent on repairs.

If the ship is completely lost or deemed lost, the amount considered as general average loss shall be the estimated value of the ship in its state before the damage, after deducting the estimated value of the repairs that are not eligible for general average loss, as well as the proceeds of any sale, if applicable.
