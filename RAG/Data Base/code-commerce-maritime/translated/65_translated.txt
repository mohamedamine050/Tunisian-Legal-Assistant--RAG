## English Translation:

The following is not subject to any form of appeal:

**Mortgage**

A formal mortgage agreement grants the creditor, over a property designated for the repayment of his debt, a real right that allows him to take precedence over ordinary creditors and creditors who rank below him in recovering his right from the proceeds of that property, regardless of who possesses it.

This does not apply to registered ships with a gross tonnage of ten cubic meters or more, regardless of whether they have been completed or are under construction. Creditors of the aforementioned ships derive their priority over each other from either maritime liens, maritime mortgages, or public law. Maritime liens are linked to the reason for the debt and always take precedence over maritime mortgages. Maritime mortgages, in turn, always take precedence over non-maritime privileges, whether general or specific.
