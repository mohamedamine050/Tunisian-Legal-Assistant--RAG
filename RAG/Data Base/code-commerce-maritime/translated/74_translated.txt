Debts related to a single voyage shall be considered preferential in accordance with their ranking as outlined in Article 71. Debts listed under the same number in Article 71 shall be ranked equally and shall be distributed proportionally based on the amount of each debt if the available funds are insufficient. The debts referred to in numbers four and six shall be paid for each type separately, regardless of the date on which they arose. Debts related to a single accident shall be deemed to have arisen simultaneously. Preferential debts arising from each voyage shall take precedence over preferential debts related to the previous voyage.
