If a Tunisian vessel, while on a voyage, is compelled to temporarily dock at a port, its captain must, according to the prescribed forms and to the authorities indicated, submit a declaration outlining the reasons for the docking, failing which the penalties stipulated in the preceding chapter shall apply. 

If a Tunisian vessel sinks and its captain alone, or together with some or all of the crew or passengers, survives, he must, whether in Tunisia or abroad, appear before the authorities indicated and submit his report. Furthermore, if he is in Tunisia, he must notify the maritime authority of the port of registration of the vessel of the accident within forty-eight hours, failing which the penalties stipulated in the preceding chapter shall be imposed. 

The authority that received the declaration, as well as, where appropriate, the authority of the port of registration of the vessel, may, on its own initiative or at the request of the captain or any other person with an interest in the matter, authorize a search to be conducted. During this search, the crew members, and if possible, the passengers, shall be required to participate. 

In any case, the maritime authority of the port of registration of the Tunisian vessel may, whenever it deems it necessary, authorize, on its own initiative, even in cases other than sinking, the conduct of such a search.
