(Amended by Law No. 22 of 1998, dated March 16, 1998) The cargo agent is the person appointed by the maritime carrier to receive the cargo after its discharge and to safeguard it until it is delivered to the consignees after they have been notified. Upon receipt of the cargo, the cargo agent must prepare a detailed inventory in the presence of the relevant parties. This inventory shall serve as evidence for or against the cargo agent in his/her dealings with the maritime carrier. This inventory shall be made available upon request to anyone involved in the transport for which it was prepared. The cargo agent shall not be liable to the consignees except in the case of his/her personal fault. He/she shall have the right to withhold the cargo for prior expenses incurred on behalf of the cargo owners.
