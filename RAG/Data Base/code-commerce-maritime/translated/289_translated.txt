If funds are paid to secure a contribution to the common losses, salvage expenses, or particular expenses, these funds shall be immediately deposited into a joint and special account opened in the name of a representative appointed by the depositors and another appointed by the provider, subject to the terms of the banks approved by both parties. If any dispute arises regarding the appointment of the representative for the depositors or the bank, it shall be decided by an urgent court order. The deposited funds, as mentioned, along with their accrued interest, if applicable, shall be kept to secure the rights of the rightful claimants. With written permission from the distributor entrusted with settling the common losses, installments may be paid from the account, or the deposited funds may be refunded. The deposit, payment of installments, and refund of the deposit shall not in any way affect the obligations of the parties.
