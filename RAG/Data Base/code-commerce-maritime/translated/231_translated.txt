The sale known as "CIF" (C. I. F) or "CAF" (C. A. F) is also a type of sale of goods by shipment, where the goods are specified by type and are free of all costs. In addition, they are insured and the transportation to the port of discharge is agreed upon. The seller is obligated to identify or distinguish the sold goods, as the case may be, and is also obligated to insure them and pay their transportation costs and take care of their shipment. The buyer's acceptance of the goods is deemed to occur at the port of discharge unless otherwise agreed upon.

**Contract**

A contract is a legally binding agreement that obligates the contracting parties and specifies their obligations and rights with respect to the specific transaction. Under this agreement, the insurer undertakes to pay the insured or the beneficiary a sum of money, a regular income, or any other financial compensation in the event of the occurrence of the insured event. This is in exchange for premiums or any other financial payment made by the insured to the insurer.
