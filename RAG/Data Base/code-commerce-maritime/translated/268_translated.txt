It is considered a general average loss any damage or defect occurring to the ship's sails and masts, or any part thereof, arising from efforts made to refloat a grounded vessel or bring it to a deeper part of the sea for the sake of general safety. However, if the vessel is afloat, any damage or defect affecting the ship, cargo, or freight, or any part thereof, for the purpose of releasing the sails, is not considered a general average loss.
