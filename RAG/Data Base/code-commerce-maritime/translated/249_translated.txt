The amount of the reward shall be determined by agreement between the parties, failing which it shall be determined by the court. The same applies to the distribution of the reward among the various vessels that participated in the assistance or salvage, or between the owners of each vessel that carried out the assistance or salvage operation and its captain and crew. The same applies in the case of the participation of several individuals or groups of individuals, each independently, in the assistance or salvage operation. In such a case, the court shall not determine the amount of the reward and its distribution except after including all those who are expected to claim a right based on assistance or salvage, as stated by the debtor of the reward.
