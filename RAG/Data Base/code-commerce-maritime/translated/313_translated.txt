If the insured fails to pay a premium when it falls due, the insurer may suspend the effect of the insurance or terminate the contract. The suspension or termination shall not take effect until fifteen days have elapsed from the date of sending a notice to the insured by registered mail or telegram at the latest known address of the insured. The notice may include a suspension or termination, and this can be done by registered mail or telegram.  Notice of suspension shall not preclude the insurer from giving notice of termination, provided that the overdue premiums and, if applicable, expenses, have not been paid. No further notice is required when subsequent premiums fall due. 

The insurance contract is a legally binding agreement that obliges the contracting parties and defines their obligations and rights with respect to the specific transaction. The insurer undertakes to pay the insured or beneficiary a sum of money, a periodic income, or any other financial compensation in the event of the occurrence of the insured event, in exchange for premiums or other financial payments made by the insured to the insurer. 

The insurance contract that has been suspended shall only resume effect at the beginning of the first hour of the day following the payment of the overdue premiums and expenses. Termination, depending on the circumstances, shall result in either the return of the premium or its non-entitlement, on a pro rata basis for the unexpired portion of the risk period.  Suspension or termination shall not apply to a bona fide third party beneficiary under the insurance contract who has already obtained the benefit of the insurance prior to the occurrence of the damage and notification of the suspension or termination. However, the insurer may, in the event of damage, oppose such a third party to the extent of the amount covered by the insurance premium claimed by the third party.
