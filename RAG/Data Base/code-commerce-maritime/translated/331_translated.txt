If the insured value of the vessel is an agreed value, neither party may substitute it with any other value, subject to the provisions of Chapter 318. However, this does not apply in the case of a claim for contribution to general average losses or a claim for salvage remuneration. The insured value includes the hull and machinery of the vessel together, as well as all equipment and appendages, including supplies and other expenses. Any insurance contract, regardless of its date, entered into separately for equipment and appendages, shall result in the insured value of such equipment and appendages being deducted from the agreed value of the vessel in the event of the vessel's total loss or abandonment.
