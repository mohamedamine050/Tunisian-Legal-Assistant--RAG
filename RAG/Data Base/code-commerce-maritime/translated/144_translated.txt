The maritime carrier, liable for any damage, loss, or defect pursuant to Article 131, who can avail themselves of the limitations of liability set forth in Articles 132 and 133, may further invoke, in the event of shipment of goods under a bill of lading, the following special rules. These rules shall apply from the time the master or the maritime carrier's crew takes possession of the goods until delivery to the consignee. If both a charter party and a bill of lading exist simultaneously, the aforementioned rules apply to the holders of the bills of lading, unless they specifically refer to the charter party.
