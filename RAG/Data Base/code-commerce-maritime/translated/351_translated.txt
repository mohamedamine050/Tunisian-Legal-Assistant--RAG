The value of the defect, damage, or deficiency is assessed by experts known as "Marine Loss Adjusters" appointed by the judge or the insurance contract.

**Insurance Contract**

A contract is a legally binding agreement that obligates the contracting parties and defines their obligations and rights in relation to the specific transaction. By this contract, the insurer undertakes to pay the insured or the beneficiary a sum of money, a regular income, or any other financial compensation in the event of the occurrence of the insured event, in return for premiums or any other financial payment made by the insured to the insurer, or by the mutual agreement of both parties.

The appointed adjuster(s) will conduct their inspections after inviting both parties and any interested parties to attend by registered mail with acknowledgement of receipt, specifying the type of disaster and its causes, if possible. Their report has probative value between the parties and for the judge. It does not have probative value for other parties concerned in the matter who were invited to attend the inspection process, unless they attended the process and were notified in the same summons of the consequences of their attendance.  Regardless of any contrary agreement, the fees of the marine loss adjuster(s) shall be borne by the insurer, except in cases of frivolous litigation.
