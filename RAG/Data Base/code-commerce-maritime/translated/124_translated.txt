The ownership of the vessel shall not be transferred by the act of sale unless it is followed by payment of expenses and securing the price.  The act of sale legally purges the vessel of all privileges, mortgages, claims for rescission, and any precautionary measures.  It also legally results in the removal of any impediment to the vessel's departure.
