(Amended by Law No. 22 of 1998 dated March 16) The shipper is the person who entrusts a maritime carrier to transport by sea, on their own behalf or on behalf of a consignee, a specific quantity of goods in exchange for a price known as "freight." The consignee or receiver is the person named in the charter party or bill of lading to whom the transported goods must be delivered upon arrival. The consignee may be "apparent" or "nominal" when the goods are not ultimately destined for them. The consignee is "actual" or "final" when the goods are ultimately destined for them.
