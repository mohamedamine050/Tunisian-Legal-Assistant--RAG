A precautionary annotation may be entered on the registration document in the following cases:

1. **Actions seeking a ruling** to invalidate, rescind, or reverse registered rights over a registered vessel, or to amend registrations made pursuant to a transfer by death, to annul a cancellation, to rectify the registration, or to cancel the registration. 
2. **Actions seeking the registration of all acts** requiring the transfer or assignment of a registered vessel.
3. **Extraordinary appeals against registered rulings.**
4. **Decisions ordering the attachment** of vessels for preservation purposes.

The aforementioned precautionary annotation may only be entered upon authorization, by way of a petition, issued by the President of the **Court of First Instance** in the maritime zone where the vessel is registered. A precautionary annotation may be made on the registration document even in the presence of an attachment. Registrations made thereafter cannot be contested by those benefiting from precautionary annotations, which are ranked according to their dates.

A precautionary annotation lapses after three years from its entry unless the President of the **Court of First Instance** in the maritime zone where the vessel is registered, upon a petition, authorizes its renewal.
