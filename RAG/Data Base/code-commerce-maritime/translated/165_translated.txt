**(Amended by Law No. 22 of 1998 dated March 16)** The lessor is the person who, by any legal means, places at the disposal of another person, known as the lessee, a whole ship or part thereof, for a specified date, duration, conditions, and purposes, as determined either by agreement between the parties or by this Code and maritime commercial law if the agreement does not contain sufficient details or is ambiguous. The lessee may carry his own goods, and he may also carry goods belonging to others, unless otherwise stipulated, in which case he acquires the status of a maritime carrier with respect to such others. The maritime carrier is the person who undertakes, in exchange for a fee, to transport passengers or specific goods by sea from one port or berth to another. All of these persons, as well as the ship's owner, are considered as being equipped within the meaning of Article 130.
