The insured is exempt from any claim based on the following reasons and their consequences:

a. **Defects inherent to the insured object**, including worms, insects, use of sanitary and disinfectant methods, the effects of heat, and changes in the taste of liquids stored in barrels, unless it is proven that these are due to one of the risks covered by the insurance contract.

b. **Damage** arising from **sins, sequestration, placing under credit, seizure, and measures taken due to breach of blockade, smuggling, or prohibited or clandestine trade**.

c. **Fines and other penalties** resulting from all types of bail or guarantees given to relinquish seized objects.

d. **Damages that do not directly result in damage or loss to the insured object**, such as unemployment, delays, price differences, various costs of staying in quarantine, winter quarters, or additional waiting, storage costs, damage resulting from export or supply bans, and all obstacles that prevent the insured from conducting his business or any commercial activity.

**Contract**

A contract is a legally binding agreement that obligates the contracting parties and defines their obligations and rights with respect to the specific transaction.

**Damage**

[1] Injury inflicted in violation of the law, affecting a person's body, mental or psychological health, reputation, property, or reputation.

[2] Loss or damage to property, deprivation of comfort, harm to physical well-being, reputation, or the like.

Damage in crimes and offenses similar to crimes is the actual loss suffered by the plaintiff and the necessary expenses that he was forced or will be forced to incur to repair the consequences of the act that harmed him, as well as what he was deprived of in the normal course of the consequences of that act.
