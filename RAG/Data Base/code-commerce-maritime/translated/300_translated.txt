It is permissible to conclude an insurance contract.

An insurance contract is a legally binding agreement that obligates the contracting parties and defines their respective obligations and rights in relation to the specific transaction. 

Under this contract, the insurer undertakes to pay the insured or the beneficiary a sum of money, a regular income, or any other financial compensation in the event of the occurrence of the insured event, in return for premiums or other financial payments made by the insured to the insurer.  

These payments may be made on behalf of a specific person or on behalf of whomever is entitled to receive them.
