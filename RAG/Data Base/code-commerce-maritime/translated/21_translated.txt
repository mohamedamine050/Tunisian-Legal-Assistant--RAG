Each partner in the ownership of a vessel has the right to transfer their share to a third party without the consent of the other partners, provided that the other partners have the right to claim the share within fifteen days following their notification of the transfer. If the transfer is made to a foreigner and it would result in the loss of the vessel's Tunisian nationality, it shall not be valid unless all the partners consent and a prior license is obtained from the Maritime Authority. If a foreigner becomes a partner in the ownership of the vessel through inheritance or will, and their share would lead to the loss of the Tunisian nationality of the vessel, then the heir or beneficiary shall transfer a sufficient portion of their rights to a Tunisian so that the vessel retains its Tunisian nationality, taking into account the right of the partners to claim the share as mentioned in the case of the will. If the heir or beneficiary does not do so within six months from the occurrence of the event that made them a partner, each of the partners and the Maritime Authority shall have the right within the following six months to request a ruling from the 
Primary Court 
Primary Court
The Primary Court is generally the first court to hear a dispute and make a decision
  in whose jurisdiction the Maritime Zone Center where the vessel is registered is located, for the sale of the exceeding share held by the heir or beneficiary to a Tunisian exclusively.
