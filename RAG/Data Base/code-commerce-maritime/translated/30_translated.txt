The following matters must be registered by inscription on the registration sheet:

1. All acts and agreements between living persons, whether gratuitous or for consideration, and all judgments obtained by virtue of a judicial decision, those acts, agreements, and judgments which result in the creation of a right over a vessel, its transfer, authorization, modification, expiration, or making the vessel non-transferable in whole or in part, or changing any other condition of its registration.

2. All ship lease agreements for a fixed term exceeding one year. The transfer of the mortgage by assignment, novation, or any other means must be stated on the margin of the registration of the mortgage. This statement empowers the assignee or the substitute to dispose of the registration and release it. If no such statement is made, the assignment, novation, or cancellation issued by the registered creditor may be challenged by the creditor to whom the secured debt has been transferred.
