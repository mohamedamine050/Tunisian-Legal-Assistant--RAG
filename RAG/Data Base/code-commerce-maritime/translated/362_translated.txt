## Insurance Contract

**Insurance Contract**

A contract is a binding legal agreement that obligates the contracting parties and defines their respective rights and obligations with regard to the specific transaction.

In an insurance contract, the insurer undertakes to pay the insured or the beneficiary a sum of money, a regular income, or any other financial compensation in the event of the occurrence of the insured event. This is in exchange for premiums or any other financial payment made by the insured to the insurer.

The expenses incurred for assistance or rescue services, up to the insured amount, shall include expenses incurred to assist or rescue the vessel in the event of an insured risk. This insurance has no effect unless the amount guaranteed by the insurance contract is insufficient for the vessel.
