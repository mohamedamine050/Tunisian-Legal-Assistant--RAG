Every act of assistance or rescue that results in a beneficial outcome entitles the rescuer to a fair compensation. No compensation shall be due if the act of assistance or rescue does not result in a beneficial outcome, unless otherwise agreed upon. In no case shall the amount payable exceed the value of the objects saved.
