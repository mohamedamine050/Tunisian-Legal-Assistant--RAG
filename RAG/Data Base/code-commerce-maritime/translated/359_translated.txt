If the right to a freight charge is not stipulated regardless of the circumstances, it shall be guaranteed only up to sixty percent. An insurance contract does not guarantee the freight charge within the limits of the insured amount except for the contribution of the freight charge to general average losses and its reimbursement if the ship is abandoned following an insured peril. This is subject to the condition that the shipper shall, in the circumstances stipulated in numbers 3 and 4 of Chapter 338, prove that he could not continue to direct the goods to the intended destination.
