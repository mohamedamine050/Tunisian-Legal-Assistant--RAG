In a sale of goods by discharge, the seller bears the expenses of shipping, transportation, and discharge, as well as the expenses of the port of shipment, its fees, and export taxes. However, the expenses of the port of discharge, its fees, and import taxes shall be borne by the buyer, unless the goods are purchased "free of charge". The acceptance of the goods shall be deemed to have taken place at the port of discharge, unless otherwise agreed upon.
