The bill of lading is a transport document issued by the carrier or master and delivered to the shipper. It serves as evidence that the vessel has received the goods and contains a description of the goods and, if applicable, a statement of their value. It is also a document that represents the goods. It is issued in triplicate: - the first copy is for the maritime carrier. - the second copy, which is the main bill of lading, is addressed to the maritime carrier's agent at the destination. - the third copy, which is negotiable, is delivered to the shipper. The maritime carrier is obliged, upon request, to deliver a copy of the bill of lading to any interested party for the purpose of completing administrative procedures.
