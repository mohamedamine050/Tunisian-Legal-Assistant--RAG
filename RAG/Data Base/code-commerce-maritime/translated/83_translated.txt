If the ship is lost or becomes unseaworthy, the mortgagee creditor exercises his rights over the salvaged items or the proceeds of their sale, even if the debt has not matured. He also exercises his rights over the compensation that the owner is entitled to for the damages sustained by the ship that have not been repaired. If these damages are considered to be general average losses, the creditor may intervene in the settlement of losses to protect his rights.  

The mortgagee creditor legally takes the place of the owner with regard to the amount of insurance compensation that the latter may be entitled to.
