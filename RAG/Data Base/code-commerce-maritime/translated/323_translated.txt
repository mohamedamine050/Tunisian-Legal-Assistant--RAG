A waiver shall not be partial or subject to a condition.  It results in the transfer of the insured's rights in the insured objects to the insurer, and the latter is obligated to pay the full amount of the insurance indemnity. The effects of this transfer take effect from the time the insured is notified of the waiver by the insured.

Notification shall be considered as such upon signature by the opposing party, or his agent, in the presence of the competent official, on a notification document, or on the summons to appear at the appointed time.
