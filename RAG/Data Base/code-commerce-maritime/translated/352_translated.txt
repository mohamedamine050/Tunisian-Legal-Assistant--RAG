Settlement by Abandonment may be effected in the following circumstances:

1. Disappearance of the vessel, in accordance with Article 2 of Chapter 338.
2. Unseaworthiness of the vessel, if the insured, within three months from the date of notification by the insured of the unseaworthiness of the vessel, does not commence the journey to transport the cargo to the intended destination by any means of transportation. This period shall begin on the day of service of notice.

**Service of notice shall be deemed to have taken place upon the signature of the defendant, or his agent, in the presence of the competent official, on the notice of service, or on the summons to appear at the appointed time.**

3. Authorization to sell the goods during the voyage due to material defects.
4. Subsequent loss or damage to the goods if they reach at least three-quarters of their value.

In the circumstances provided for in Articles 3 and 4, if the insurance contract provides for the guarantee of damage and loss resulting from certain causes, then abandonment shall not be admissible unless the disaster occurred as a result of one of these causes.
