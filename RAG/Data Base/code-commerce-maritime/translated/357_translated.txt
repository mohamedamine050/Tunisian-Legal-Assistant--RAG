The contract referred to as an insurance contract is a legally binding agreement that obligates the contracting parties and defines their respective obligations and rights with regard to the specific transaction. 

By this contract, the insurer undertakes to pay the insured or the beneficiary a sum of money, a fixed income, or any other financial compensation in the event of the occurrence of the insured event. This is in exchange for premiums or any other financial payment made by the insured to the insurer.

The insurance contract guarantees a maximum amount specified in the agreement, subject to deduction of the amounts insured for the declared goods subject to insurance in each policy.
