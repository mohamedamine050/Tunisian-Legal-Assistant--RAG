If the fault is shared, then the responsibility of each vessel shall be in proportion to the seriousness of the errors committed by it. However, if circumstances prevent the determination of the proportion, or if it appears that the errors are equal, then the responsibility shall be borne equally. The damages inflicted upon the vessels, their cargo, the crew members, passengers, or any other person found on board the vessel, their baggage, or other belongings, shall be borne by the faulty vessels in the aforementioned proportion, without joint liability between them towards third parties. The faulty vessels shall be jointly liable towards third parties for damages arising from death or injury.
