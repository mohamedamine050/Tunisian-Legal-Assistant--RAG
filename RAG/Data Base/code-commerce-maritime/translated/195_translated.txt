The term "additional waiting time" refers to the time used after the expiration of the "waiting period". In the case of "additional waiting time", the lessor is entitled to a lump-sum penalty without prior notice, unless the lessee proves that he did not cause the delay. The penalty is determined by the agreement of the parties, if any, otherwise it is determined by the port.
