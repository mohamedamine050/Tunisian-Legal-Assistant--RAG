The lessor shall accept the goods and stow them, with the lessee placing them alongside the ship. The lessor shall then unstow the goods and deliver them alongside the ship. The lessee shall bear the costs and risks of placing the goods on the wharf, both at the time of loading and unloading. The shipping of goods on the deck of the vessel shall render the lessor liable, unless it concerns goods customarily permitted to be shipped in this manner by maritime custom, or for coastal navigation between Tunisian ports.
