The insurer, in the event of settlement by way of compensation for damages, shall only pay the value of what was acknowledged as necessary to be replaced or repaired to restore the vessel's seaworthiness. No other penalty shall be borne by the insurer for any reduction in value, idleness, or for any other reason. The difference between the old and new value shall be deducted from the value of such replacement.
