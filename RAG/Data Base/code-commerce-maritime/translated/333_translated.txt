The insured may enter into supplementary insurance contracts without the consent of the insurer to guarantee their liability for damages caused by the vessel, which were not covered by the previous chapter or which exceed the insured amount stipulated in the insurance contract.  This contract is a binding legal agreement that obligates the contracting parties and defines their obligations and rights in relation to the specific transaction.  By this contract, the insurer undertakes to pay the insured or the beneficiary a sum of money, a regular income, or any other financial compensation in the event of the occurrence of the insured event, in return for premiums or any other financial payment made by the insured to the insurer. The aforementioned contracts have no effect on the damages covered by the previous chapter, unless the insured amount stipulated in the insurance contract covering the vessel is insufficient.
