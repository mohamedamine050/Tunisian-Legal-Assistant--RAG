The plaintiff, in the event of assistance, salvage, or collision, may file his claim either before one of the courts competent under the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, or before the court of the Tunisian port to which the ship in question has taken refuge. In the event that the assistance, salvage, or collision occurred within Tunisian territorial waters, the case may also be brought before the court within whose jurisdiction the assistance, salvage, or collision took place. Any provision to the contrary shall be null and void.
