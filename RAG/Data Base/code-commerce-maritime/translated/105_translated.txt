The judge who authorized the attachment may decide to lift it according to the conditions and procedures stipulated in Article 219 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The judge must authorize the lifting of the attachment immediately if a guarantor is provided, except in cases where the attachment was made pursuant to the debts stipulated in Article 14 of Chapter 101. In all cases, the judge may authorize the exploitation of the vessel by the party subject to the attachment if the latter provides guarantees such as a document whereby the owner guarantees the vessel or the seller guarantees the absence of defects in the sale and its continued fitness for use for a sufficient period of time or decides on the most appropriate method for managing the vessel during the period of the attachment. If the parties do not agree on the guarantor, the importance of the guarantee, or its type, the judge will appoint one. 

The request to lift the attachment in exchange for providing such a guarantee or such a guarantee does not constitute an admission of liability or a waiver of the right to enjoy the legal definition of the vessel owner's liability.
