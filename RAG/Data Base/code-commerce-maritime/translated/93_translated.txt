The new owner declares in this notice that he will pay to the dissenting preferred creditors and mortgagees their debts in the amount of the purchase price agreed upon by the contracting parties, unless it exceeds or falls short of the value of the property sold, or the value declared by them, without deducting any amount from it in favor of the seller or any other person. The new owner benefits from the terms granted to the original debtor and respects the terms stipulated for the latter unless the debt instruments stipulate otherwise. Debts whose due date has not yet arrived and whose amount is not considered to be part of the creditors' share become immediately due to the extent of that portion for the new owner, and in full for the original debtor.
