If temporary repairs are carried out on a vessel in a port of shipment, a port of call, or a port of refuge, for the sake of public safety or due to a defect that qualifies as general average, then the value of those repairs shall be considered general average. If temporary repairs are carried out following a fortuitous damage solely to enable the vessel to complete its voyage, then the value of those repairs shall be considered general average, provided that it does not exceed the amount of expenses saved that would have been paid and considered general average if those repairs were carried out at a different location. No amount shall be deducted for the difference between old and new for the value of temporary repairs that are considered general average.
