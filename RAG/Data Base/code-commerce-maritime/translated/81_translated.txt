**Registration Preserves the Mortgage**

The official mortgage is a contract by which the creditor acquires a real right over a specific property designated to satisfy his debt. This right entitles him to priority over ordinary creditors and subsequent creditors in the order of satisfaction of his claim from the sale proceeds of that property, regardless of who possesses it. 

The registration is valid for ten years from the date of its execution. The effect of the registration ceases if it is not renewed before the expiry of the aforementioned period. The renewal of the registration is effected by the creditor submitting a petition to the maritime authority during the aforementioned period, specifying therein with precision the registration to be renewed. Any petition submitted after the expiry of that period shall be considered as a request for a new registration.
