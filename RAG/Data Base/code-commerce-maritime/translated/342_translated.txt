##  Insurance Contracts

**Insurance**

**Contract**

A contract is a legally binding agreement that obliges the contracting parties and defines their obligations and rights in relation to the specific transaction. 

Under an insurance contract, the insurer undertakes to pay the insured or the beneficiary a sum of money, a periodic income, or any other monetary compensation in the event of the occurrence of the insured event, in return for premiums or other financial payments made by the insured to the insurer. 

Where a contract relates to multiple vessels owned by one outfitter, it shall be executed as if each vessel were owned by a separate outfitter. The outfitter's goods or other gains shall be treated by the insurer of the vessel as if they belonged to another party.
