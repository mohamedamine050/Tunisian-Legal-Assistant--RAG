Any declaration contrary to reality made by the insured, which could substantially diminish the insurer's assessment of the risk, can lead to the annulment of the insurance. 

**Insurance**

An insurance contract is one in which the insurer undertakes to pay the insured or the beneficiary a sum of money, a periodic income, or any other financial compensation in the event of the occurrence of the insured event, in exchange for premiums or other financial payments made by the insured to the insurer.

Even in the absence of an intention to deceive, any omission by the insured regarding matters they are required to disclose, which diminishes the insurer's assessment of the risk, can also lead to the annulment of the insurance. 

The insurer may claim annulment even if the false declaration or omission did not contribute to the damage or the loss of the insured object. 

However, the insurer retains the right to claim damages if the insured acted with intent to deceive. 

**Damage**
