In a charterparty for a fixed term, the charterer assumes the commercial management of the vessel, while the owner assumes its nautical management. In this arrangement, the charterer supplies the vessel with fuel and fresh water and bears the cost of overtime worked by the crew at his request, as well as port dues, pilotage, towage, and any other expenses required for the commercial exploitation of the vessel. The owner is responsible for equipping and maintaining the vessel, providing supplies, engaging crew members, feeding them, and paying their wages. He may also delegate the management of the vessel's navigation to the charterer.

If the charterer is simultaneously the manager of both the nautical and commercial affairs of the vessel, the loss of the vessel and general average losses, no matter how serious, shall be borne by him unless he proves they arose from a navigational hazard. However, if the charterer is solely the manager of the vessel's commercial affairs, such loss and losses shall be borne by the owner, unless he proves they arose from the charterer's fault.
