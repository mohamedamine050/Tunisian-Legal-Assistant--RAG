The provisions of this book aim to clarify and define the rights and obligations of the parties to insurance agreements, solely to prevent any deficiencies, ambiguities, or obscurities in such agreements or in the provisions that the parties refer to for application. The parties are free to enter into their agreements in any manner they deem fit, particularly by specifying the application of any foreign law, any model agreement, or by quoting from multiple laws or model agreements or by creating new model agreements, all with due regard for the restrictions and prohibitions contained in this code. The legal provisions relating to land insurance are not applicable to maritime insurance.
