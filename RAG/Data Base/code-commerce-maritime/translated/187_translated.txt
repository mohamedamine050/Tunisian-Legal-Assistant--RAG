The Lessee shall: 1.  Provide the shipment for which he has contracted. 2. Pay the agreed upon transportation fee. If the Lessee does not provide the entirety of the agreed upon quantity of goods, he shall nevertheless pay the full transportation fee. He shall be credited with the expenses saved for the vessel and three-fourths of the transportation fee for the goods that were shipped in place of his goods. If the Lessee ships more goods than agreed upon, he shall pay the transportation fee for the surplus based on the amount stipulated in the lease agreement. If the Lessee cancels the voyage before the departure of the vessel and before loading any goods, he shall be liable to the Lessor, as compensation, for half of the transportation fee agreed upon in the lease agreement for the entire shipment he intended to transport. If he cancels the voyage after loading some of the agreed upon goods and the vessel departs without the full shipment, the full transportation fee shall be paid to the Lessor.
