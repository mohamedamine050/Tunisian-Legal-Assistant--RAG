## English Translation:

Defendants, when confronted by the holder of a negotiable and endorsed bill of lading, may not raise defenses based on their personal relationships with the endorser or previous holders, unless the holder, upon acquiring the bill of lading, intentionally caused harm to the debtor. The endorser, without solidarity, guarantees the existence of the goods shipped and the validity of the contract of carriage.

**Contract**

A contract is a legally binding agreement that creates obligations for the contracting parties and defines their respective rights and obligations in relation to the specific transaction.
