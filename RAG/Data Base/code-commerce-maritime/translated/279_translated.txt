The amount considered as general average loss due to damage or deterioration shall be calculated based on the prevailing market price on the last day of discharge of the vessel or on the last day of the voyage if it ended in a place other than the original destination. If the damaged goods are sold, and no agreement has been reached to determine the amount of the damage, the loss considered as general average loss shall be the difference between the net proceeds of the sale and the net value on the last day of discharge of the vessel or on the last day of the voyage if it ended in a place other than the original destination.
