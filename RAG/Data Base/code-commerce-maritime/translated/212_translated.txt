The carrier, by the bill of lading, is obligated, before departure and upon commencement of the voyage, to exercise reasonable care to ensure the vessel is properly prepared for navigation. This includes equipping and supplying the vessel with appropriate equipment, personnel, and provisions, as well as preparing its holds, refrigerated rooms, and other compartments where goods are to be loaded, transported, and preserved. The carrier is also responsible for loading, handling, stowing, and unloading the goods in a proper and careful manner.
