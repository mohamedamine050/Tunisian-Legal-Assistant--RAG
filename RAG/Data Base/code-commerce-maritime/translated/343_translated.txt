The insurance contract continues.

The contract is a legally binding agreement that obligates the contracting parties and defines their obligations and rights in relation to the specific transaction. 

By virtue of this contract, the insurer undertakes to pay the insured or the beneficiary a sum of money, a regular income, or any other financial compensation in the event of the occurrence of the insured event, in exchange for premiums or any other financial payment made by the insured to the insurer.

The contract continues legally in the event of the sale or lease of the vessel, for the benefit of the new owner or lessee, provided that the insurer is notified within ten days and that the insured fulfills all his obligations to the insurer under the contract. The insurer may terminate the contract within one month from the date of notification of the sale or lease. This termination shall not take effect until fifteen days after notification. The seller or lessee remains obligated to pay the insurance premiums for the period prior to the sale or lease.
