## Contract

**Contract**

A contract is a legally binding agreement that obligates the contracting parties and defines their obligations and rights in relation to the specific transaction.

**Sea Transportation**

Sea transportation is an agreement by which a sea carrier undertakes, for a fee, to deliver a person and their belongings from a specific port to another port. It includes the necessary provisions for the accommodation of the passengers and their belongings on board the ship from the time they embark until they disembark, including the embarkation and disembarkation processes, excluding the accommodation of passengers and their belongings at seaports and docks. It includes, when necessary, their transportation by water or other land means to and from the ship, if the travel ticket includes the price of such transportation or if the means used for this sub-transport has been put at the disposal of the passenger by the sea carrier. Any term contrary to this is considered null and void.
