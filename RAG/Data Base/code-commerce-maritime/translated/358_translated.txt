It is permissible to insure against the cost of transportation, wages, preservation expenses, repatriation expenses, and anticipated profits, and generally against anything that can be valued in money and is susceptible to maritime risks. The insurance contract obliges the insurer to pay the insured or the beneficiary a sum of money, a regular income, or any other financial compensation in the event of the occurrence of the insured risk, in exchange for premiums or any other financial payment made by the insured to the insurer.
