Upon a petition submitted by a party having an interest in the transportation or its insurer, 
an authorization may be granted to appoint 
one or three experts. These experts shall be tasked specifically with examining the external and internal condition of the parcels and goods transported, inspecting their condition, identifying any deficiencies and assessing their value, describing any damages and estimating their value, and determining their causes. The parties shall be summoned to attend the examination by written notice or registered telegram. The aforementioned authorization or a subsequent authorization may decide to place the parcels or goods under sequestration and to transfer them to a public or private warehouse. However, authorization for their sale may not be granted except through an emergency court order.
