Registered veterinary surgeons are permitted to form partnerships to practice their profession, subject to the following conditions:

1. No partnership may consist of more than five partners.
2. Every partnership between veterinary surgeons must be governed by a written contract that respects the professional independence of each partner. This contract shall specify:
    a. The assets held in common by the partners.
    b. The rights and obligations of each partner.
    c. The registered office of the partnership.
    d. The prohibition of any partner or heir from transferring their share in the partnership to an outsider without the consent of the other partners.
    e. The conditions under which any partner may leave the partnership at any time.
    f. The procedures for resolving disputes between partners and for dissolving the partnership.
3. No provision shall be included in the contract that would give the partnership the character of a monopoly or a cartel directed against non-member veterinary surgeons.
4. Partnerships between colleagues residing in different localities may only be formed if they have been practicing in their respective localities for at least three years. In such cases, the location of their clinics may not be changed without obtaining a license from the Regional Council of the Veterinary Surgeons Order concerned.
5. The Regional Council of the Veterinary Surgeons Order must be notified of the professional terms of the partnership contract to ensure their compliance with the principles of this Law and the provisions mentioned above. The contract shall enter into force unless the partners are notified of the Regional Council's objection within three months of the notification.
