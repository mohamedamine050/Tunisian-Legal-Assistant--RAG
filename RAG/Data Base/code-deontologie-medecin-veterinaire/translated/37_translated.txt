Except where otherwise agreed upon by the parties concerned, a veterinarian is prohibited from establishing or partnering with a colleague, soliciting clients, or practicing as an assistant or replacement within a 20-kilometer radius of the veterinarian's clinic where he was employed for compensation, assistance, partnership, or training. The prohibition period begins on the day following the termination of such activity and lasts for two years if any of these activities were performed for a period of 30 to 90 days, and for five years if the period exceeds 90 days. A written contract must be entered into between the parties for any compensation or assistance exceeding six months, setting out the rights and obligations of the parties, particularly in the case of the compensated or assisted veterinarian who ceased practicing all professional activities at the place of compensation or assistance. The same provisions apply when the duration of assistance or compensation reaches six months.
