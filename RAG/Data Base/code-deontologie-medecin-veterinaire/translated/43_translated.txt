The owner of the animal may consult with another veterinarian of their own choosing. However, if the treating veterinarian does not approve of the consultation, they may withdraw from the case without providing an explanation. In the event of approval, the treating veterinarian must notify the consulting veterinarian(s) and agree on a day and time for the visit.
