A veterinarian may not request assistance or temporary compensation except from a person legally qualified to practice this activity. The veterinarian must inform the regional council of the veterinary medical order, which will examine whether the assistant or replacement possesses the necessary qualifications and ethics. The replacement or assistant is subject to the disciplinary authority of the veterinary medical order during the period of replacement or assistance. The veterinarian who is being replaced must inform the public administrations benefiting from his services.
