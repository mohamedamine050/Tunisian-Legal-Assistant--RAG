The National Council shall rule on the request for registration in the register within a maximum period of two months from the date of its receipt. It shall inform the concerned party of its decision by registered letter within the following week. The two-month period may be extended once for a maximum period of two months by a reasoned decision if it appears necessary to complete the information or if it is necessary to conduct a search outside of Tunisia. The concerned party shall be informed of the decision to extend within one week. In the event of refusal of registration, the decision shall be reasoned and subject to appeal. Upon the expiry of the notification period specified for the Council, its silence shall be considered an implicit refusal subject to appeal. 
The notification of the registration in the register shall be immediately communicated to the Minister responsible for Agriculture, the Minister responsible for Public Health, and the Public Prosecutor at the Court of Appeal in Tunis.
