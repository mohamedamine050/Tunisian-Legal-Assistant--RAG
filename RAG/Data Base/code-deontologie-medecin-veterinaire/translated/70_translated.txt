It is strictly forbidden for any veterinarian to perform diagnostic, preventive, or therapeutic actions on animals suspected of being infected with diseases that are subject to collective preventive treatment by order of the administration and under its supervision, in the event that another veterinarian has been assigned to perform these actions. This prohibition does not apply to biological diagnoses performed by laboratories or during legal examinations.
