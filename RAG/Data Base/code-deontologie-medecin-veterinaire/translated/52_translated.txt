Veterinary surgeons are prohibited from directly or indirectly reducing their fees below the minimum amounts set by the National Council. In all cases, setting a lump sum fee for the effectiveness of treatment is forbidden.  

In case of an objection, the National Council may intervene for arbitration upon request of the concerned party.
