In the event of an agreement between the treating veterinarian and the consulting veterinarian, the results of the consultation are presented to the owner by the consulting veterinarian. The presentation must acknowledge the efforts of the treating veterinarian. If a change in treatment is deemed necessary, the changes must be presented to the owner in a manner that does not imply a denial of prior work or constitute indirect criticism of previous prescriptions.
