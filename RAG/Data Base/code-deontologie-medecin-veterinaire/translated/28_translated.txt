A veterinarian is prohibited from opening veterinary clinics on their own account in commercial premises or their branches, particularly pharmacies, laboratories, drug stores, facilities for the manufacture or sale of pharmaceutical or food products, butcher shops, cafes, places selling beverages, animal trading establishments, facilities for cosmetics, and stores owned, rented, or operated by animal welfare organizations. Such clinics are also not permitted in veterinary shops or animal shelters, unless they are owned by the veterinarian. 

Providing open consultations to the public, whether free or for a fee, that benefit materially or morally any individual or legal entity not belonging to the profession is prohibited, except in the case of a non-profit organization whose primary activity is animal welfare. In this latter case, free consultations must be restricted to animals whose owners lack sufficient resources.

These obligations must be taken into account by the veterinarian or veterinarians attached to such associations through written contracts subject to the approval of the regional council of the relevant veterinary school. The council must ensure that these contracts comply with the provisions of this law, particularly guaranteeing the complete professional independence of the veterinarian.
