Every veterinarian, in the event of an unavoidable absence or illness, may rely on a nearby colleague to compensate for them free of charge, on the condition of reciprocity and reimbursement of the expenses incurred by their replacement.  These colleagues are to assess, to the best of their ability, the extent to which they can, without extravagance, request assistance.  Both the colleagues and those who have secured continuity shares are required to withdraw upon the return of the patient or the absent veterinarian to the practice of their duties, and to inform the latter of the nature and consequences of their interventions.
