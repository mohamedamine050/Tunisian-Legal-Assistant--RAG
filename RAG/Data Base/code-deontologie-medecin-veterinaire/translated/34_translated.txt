In the event of the death of a veterinarian, neighboring colleagues must place themselves at the disposal of the heirs or beneficiaries to address the requests of their deceased colleague's clients, in accordance with the provisions of Article 33 concerning absence or illness.  These colleagues, for a period not exceeding six months, must refrain from any attempt to solicit the clients of their deceased colleague to allow their heirs or beneficiaries to take all necessary steps to protect their interests. Veterinarians assigned by the competent authorities in place of their deceased colleague to perform meat inspection, market, and livestock slaughterhouse surveillance duties, must inform these authorities that they will not accept these tasks except on a temporary basis as an interim measure, pending the official appointment of another veterinarian to these clients. The competent authority retains the exclusive right to choose the veterinarian ultimately assigned to perform the surveillance duties. During the six-month period, no clinic shall be opened except in accordance with the provisions of Article 37 of this Order.
