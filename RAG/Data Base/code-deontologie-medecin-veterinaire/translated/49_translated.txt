Expert veterinarians employed by insurance companies shall not examine animals without notifying the attending veterinarian on the day of the visit, except in cases where their duties are limited to monitoring legal provisions. In such cases, they may act independently. However, they are required to inform the attending veterinarian of their visit after completing it.
