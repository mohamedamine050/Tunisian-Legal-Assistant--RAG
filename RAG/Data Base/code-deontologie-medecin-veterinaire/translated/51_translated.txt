A veterinarian who permanently ceases the practice of his profession must inform the President of the Regional Council of the Veterinary Surgeons Order concerned by registered mail with acknowledgement of receipt, and, where appropriate, designate a substitute who is qualified to practice this profession. The substituted veterinarian permanently loses the right to practice within the minimum distances set out in Article 37 for at least 30 years, unless the parties agree otherwise.
