(Added by Law No. 40 of the Year 2000 dated 5 April 2000).  The marketing of any pharmaceutical product or veterinary drug in the market, in addition to the authorization referred to in Article 11 of this law, is subject to obtaining, for each batch, a marketing authorization issued upon application from the producer or importer. The authorization shall be granted or refused by a decision of the Minister of Health, based on the opinion of a qualified body designated by an Order, after it has verified that all the conditions related to the quality specifications of the concerned substance are met. In the event of the withdrawal of a batch or the withdrawal of a license to use, the marketing authorization(s) issued shall become null and void. The granting of marketing authorization does not absolve the public authorities from their liability.
