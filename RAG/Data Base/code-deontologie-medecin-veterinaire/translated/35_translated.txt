The widow, heirs, or beneficiaries of a veterinarian, upon obtaining the approval of the Regional Council of the Veterinary Practitioners' Order, may ensure the needs of the clients by a substitute for a maximum period of one year from the date of death. If the deceased veterinarian has a Tunisian daughter or son who is studying at a veterinary school and expresses in writing, within six months of the date of death, their clear intention to take over their deceased father's clientele, the Regional Council of the Veterinary Practitioners' Order may grant them the necessary time.  Furthermore, an extension may be granted to children of veterinarians who have obtained their diploma and are fulfilling their military service or contractual obligations, for a period not exceeding two years. In all cases, compensation must be provided by any duly registered veterinarian in the Order.
