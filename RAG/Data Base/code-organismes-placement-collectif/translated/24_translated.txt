The constitutive contracts or internal regulations of collective investment institutions in securities may stipulate that:

The Board of Directors, the Collective Management Body, or the Manager may temporarily suspend repurchase operations, as well as issuance operations, if exceptional circumstances require it or if the interests of the shareholders or holders of shares so dictate, and after consulting with the auditor. These contracts or regulations must specify the conditions for taking the suspension decision, and must stipulate the obligation to inform the shareholders or holders of shares in accordance with procedures established by the constitutive contracts or internal regulations.

The Capital Market Authority must be notified without delay of the suspension decision and its reasons.
