## English Translation:

**Debt Collection by the Transferring Institution**

**Collection**

Collection is the process by which a creditor recovers the payment of a financial debt owed to him by his debtor.

The transferring institution collects debts according to the conditions set forth in an agreement entered into with the manager of the common debt fund, as stipulated in Chapter 44 of this Code.

However, a bank other than the transferring institution may be entrusted with the collection of all or part of the transferred debts. In this case, the debtor shall be notified by telegram, telex, fax or any other means leaving a written record, without any other formality. From the date of this notification, the debtor shall not be released from his obligation if he makes payment to the transferring institution.
