The net result of collective investment institutions in securities is made up of the total amount derived from:

profits, bonuses, gains, accruals, attendance bonuses, and any other income related to the securities comprising the portfolios of these institutions, as well as income from unused funds, after deducting expenses and commissions of exploitation and management.

The distributable funds consist of the net result and carried-over profits, with the addition or subtraction, as the case may be, of the balance of the income adjustment account related to the fiscal year ending.
