Management companies are companies with concealed names whose sole purpose is to manage the portfolios of collective investment institutions in securities. The capital of management companies cannot be less than one hundred thousand dinars upon their establishment. Management companies must also demonstrate at any time that their capital is not less than 5% of the total assets entrusted to them for management. This percentage requirement ceases to apply if the capital reaches five hundred thousand dinars.
