This supervision aims to verify that the activities of these institutions comply with the legal and regulatory provisions in force. The provisions of Chapters 41 to 44 and 48 to 52 of Law No. 117 of 1994 dated November 14, 1994, concerning the reorganization of the financial market, apply to them. To carry out this supervision, the Financial Market Authority may request all documents and instructions deemed necessary and conduct all on-site investigations.
