The assets of the collective employment institution in securities must be deposited with a custodian who is solely a bank within the meaning of the law relating to credit institutions or legal entities whose registered office is in the Republic of Tunisia and registered on a list established by a decision of the Minister of Finance.

The appointment of the custodian shall be specified in the constituent act or internal regulations.

The positions of manager and custodian cannot be held by the same person in the same collective employment institution in securities.

The custodian shall ensure, as the case may be, that the decisions taken by the officials of the collective employment institution in securities or the manager comply with the laws, regulations in force, and the constituent act or internal regulations of the institution. The custodian remains liable for the acts of the person before the law or for the compensation for the damage caused, even if they have delegated all or part of the assets entrusted to them.
