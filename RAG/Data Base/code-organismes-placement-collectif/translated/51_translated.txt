An auditor for Collective Employment Institutions shall be appointed from among the registered accounting experts listed in the Tunisian Register of Accounting Experts for a period of three years. Irrespective of their legal obligations, auditors of Collective Employment Institutions must:

1) Immediately inform the Financial Market Authority of any act that may pose a threat to the interests of Collective Employment Institutions, shareholders, and holders of shares.

2) Deliver to the Financial Market Authority, within six months following the closure of each fiscal year, a report on the audit they conducted.

3) Forward to the Financial Market Authority a copy of their report intended, as the case may be, for the general meeting of the Collective Employment Institution subject to their audit or for the manager of the Institution.

After hearing the concerned party, the Financial Market Authority may, against any auditor who breaches the obligations entrusted to him, issue a decision to deprive him from practicing his activity with Collective Employment Institutions, either temporarily for a period not exceeding three years, or permanently. The auditor shall be notified of the decision by telegram, telex, fax, or any other means leaving a written trace.

The decision of the Financial Market Authority may be appealed by the penalized auditor before the Court of Appeal in Tunis within twenty days from the date of notification of the penalty.
