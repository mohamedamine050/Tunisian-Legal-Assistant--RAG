The rights of joint owners are constituted by shares. Each share represents the same portion of the assets of the common fund for investment in securities. The fund shares are considered financial instruments.

Ownership of the shares is established by registration on a list maintained by the manager of the common fund for investment in securities referred to in Chapter 16 of this code. This registration results in the issuance of a certificate to the subscriber.
