The issuance or repurchase of shares or units shall be carried out at all times on the basis of the liquidation value after adding or subtracting the issuance or repurchase commissions as stipulated in the articles of association or by-laws.

The liquidation value shall be equal to the result of dividing the net assets of the collective investment undertaking in securities by the number of shares or units in circulation. The portion of the issuance or repurchase price representing the share or unit's portion of retained earnings shall be recorded in the retained earnings account, the portion representing the share or unit's portion of income received since the beginning of the fiscal year shall be recorded in the current fiscal year income adjustment account, and the portion representing the share or unit's portion of the fiscal year's profits shall be recorded in the terminated fiscal year income adjustment account, provided that the issuance or repurchase operation occurs before the distribution of these profits.
