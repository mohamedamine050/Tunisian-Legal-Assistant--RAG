The manager shall be a limited liability company whose sole purpose is to manage collective debt funds. The initial capital of debt fund management companies shall not be less than one hundred thousand dinars.

Moreover, debt fund management companies must prove at all times that their capital is not less than 5% of the total assets entrusted to them for management. This percentage requirement ceases to apply when the capital reaches five hundred thousand dinars.

The manager represents the collective debt fund in all legal proceedings, both in claiming and defending, as well as in all matters concerning its rights and obligations.

The depositor, who may hold the assets of the collective debt fund, can be a bank within the meaning of the law on credit institutions or legal entities whose registered office is in the Republic of Tunisia and whose names are listed in a register established by a decree of the Minister of Finance.

The depositor, who may be the assignor, bears the responsibility for:

*  ensuring the fulfillment of the obligations of the person before the law or providing compensation for any damage caused;
*  preserving the debt securities assigned to the collective debt fund and its available funds. 

The depositor is also responsible for verifying that the decisions made by the manager comply with the laws, regulations, and internal rules in force.
