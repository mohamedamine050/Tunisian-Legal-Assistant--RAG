The Common Debt Fund is a joint ownership whose sole purpose is to acquire sound debts held by banks or other institutions, which are regulated by order for the purpose of issuing shares representing those debts. The Fund's shares are issued in a single batch.

The nature and characteristics of the debts that the Common Debt Fund can acquire are regulated by order.

The risks of collecting debts acquired by the Common Debt Fund are covered by one or more of the following means:

- Transferring the debt amount to the Fund, exceeding the value of the issued shares.

- Issuing specific shares that bear the risk of debtors' default, provided that natural persons and collective investment institutions in securities cannot acquire this type of share.

- Obtaining a guarantee from a bank or insurance institution that cannot postpone payment under its terms.

- Providing suitable guarantees related to the acquired debts.

The Fund's internal regulations expressly specify the means of covering the risks of non-collection of debts acquired by the Fund.
