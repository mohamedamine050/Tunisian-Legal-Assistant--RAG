Every final judgment, being a written decision issued by a court resolving a legal or factual issue, convicting the managers of the common investment fund or the depositary, pursuant to the criminal provisions contained in this Code, shall obligatorily lead to the termination of their duties and deprivation of their eligibility to perform these duties.

The court before which the lawsuit is brought, pursuant to the liability provided for in Article 18 of this Code, may, upon the request of a shareholder, declare the dismissal of the managers of the fund or the depositary from their duties.

The depositary may also request the court to dismiss the managers of the fund, and the auditor must be notified thereof.

In these three cases, the court shall appoint a temporary manager until the appointment of new managers, or, if that is not possible, until the liquidation.
