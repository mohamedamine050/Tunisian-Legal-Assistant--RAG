The constitutive contracts of variable capital investment companies must expressly state that the capital can be increased by issuing new shares or decreased by the company repurchasing its own shares retrieved from their owners at their request.

Furthermore, they must specify that each shareholder has the right, at any time, to request the company to repurchase their shares at the price determined according to Chapter 25 of this Code, except in the case provided for in Chapter 3.
