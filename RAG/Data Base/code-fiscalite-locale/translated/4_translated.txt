The information on built properties concerning the property tax is extracted by the designated financial collectors through an annual "Collection Schedule" (*) prepared by the local municipality. This schedule may be updated during the year on the occasion of each inspection referred to in Article 21 of this Code.  It includes the following information: the name, title, and address of the taxpayer; the location of the built property; and the annual tax amount. The "Collection Schedule," signed by the Mayor of the local municipality, has executive effect and is used for the collection of the property tax for the entire period covered by the census, taking into account the updates and additions made by the local municipality in accordance with the provisions of the second paragraph of Article 21 of this Code. The collection of the tax for each taxpayer is tracked by means of an extract from the Collection Schedule, endorsed by the financial collector of the local municipality (added by Article 57 of Law No. 106 of 2005 dated December 19, 2005).  Collection is the process by which the creditor obtains payment of the debt owed to him by the debtor.
