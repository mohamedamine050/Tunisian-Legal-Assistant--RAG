Local authorities may monitor the permits referred to in Articles 14, 15, and 17 of this Code by relying on any official document or any other means of proof permitted by law.  For this purpose, by means of a registered letter with acknowledgement of receipt or a notice with a signed delivery receipt from the party concerned, they may request the latter to provide all explanations or justifications for all elements used to determine the property tax base on built properties. In the event that the requested explanations and justifications are not provided, local authorities may apply the provisions of paragraph III of Article 4 of this Code. Local authorities may, outside of census operations, add unregistered properties to the "collection register" (*), or amend the tax base for properties registered in the "collection register" (*). Based on the information provided by the local authority officers in charge of monitoring, new assessments may be made or previously levied taxes may be amended. In both cases, those liable for the tax shall be informed thereof by means of a registered letter with acknowledgement of receipt or a notice with a signed delivery receipt from the party concerned.
