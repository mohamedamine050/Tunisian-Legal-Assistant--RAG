I. Built properties located in areas under the jurisdiction of local municipalities are subject to an annual tax called "tax on built properties," except for properties intended for activities subject to the taxes referred to in Articles 35 and 41 of this Code.  II. The tax on built properties existing on January 1st of each year is due on that date.  It is also due on properties that are completed, extended, heightened, or that become subject to the tax on built properties during the year, by virtue of a change in their use, from the date of the aforementioned operations.
