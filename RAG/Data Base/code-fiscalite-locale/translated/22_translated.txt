Amounts paid in error or without cause as property tax on built properties, as well as related penalties, may be recovered following the submission of a request to the relevant local authority, until the end of the third year following the year in which the tax was erroneously or without cause paid.  The relevant local authority must respond to the recovery request within a maximum period of three months from the date of its submission.  Failure to respond within the timeframe stipulated in this article constitutes an implicit rejection of the recovery request.
