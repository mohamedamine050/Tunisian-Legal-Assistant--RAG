It is prohibited for any person qualified to draw up contracts to draft deeds relating to immovable property subject to property tax on built-up properties unless he/she is provided with a certificate attesting to the payment of the due tax on the date of drafting the deed, issued by the relevant local authority.  This certificate must be mentioned in the deed. The person qualified to draw up contracts shall be jointly and severally liable with those claiming the tax in the event of failure to comply with this requirement.
