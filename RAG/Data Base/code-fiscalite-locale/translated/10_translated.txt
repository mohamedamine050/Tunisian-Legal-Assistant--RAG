Every purchaser of a property subject to *maloum* must verify that the *maloum* levied on the property up to the date of sale has been paid.  In the event of non-payment, the purchaser becomes jointly and severally liable with the seller for any outstanding *maloum* due before the transfer of ownership. This procedure applies to purchasers of built properties transferred with the authorization of the courts.
