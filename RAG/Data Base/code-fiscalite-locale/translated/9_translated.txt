Owners must inform the relevant local authority, by means of a declaration provided by the administration, regarding new constructions, constructions that have been extended or raised, constructions whose vacancy period has expired, or constructions that have become subject to property tax on built-up properties.  Generally, this notification must cover all changes in the composition of buildings or their intended use, within thirty days following their completion, the end of their vacancy, or their entry into the scope of application of the property tax on built-up properties.
