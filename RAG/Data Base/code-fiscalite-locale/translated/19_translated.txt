Objections submitted to the review committee must be in writing, accompanied by all supporting documents, and deposited with the competent services of the local authority against receipt of a confirmation slip or by registered mail with acknowledgement of receipt.  A decision on all objections shall be made after hearing the claimants, who shall be summoned by registered mail with acknowledgement of receipt.  In the event that the claimant is unable to attend, he may appoint a representative.  The absence of the claimant or his representative shall not prevent the review committee from deciding on the objection. The review committee shall notify its decisions to the parties concerned by registered mail with acknowledgement of receipt or by notification with a signed receipt from the concerned party, before the completion of the census operations for objections received during the census operations, and within two months of the date of the objection for objections received outside the census operations.  The placement of the individual in the position must suit the conditions and requirements of the job in terms of qualifications and competences.
