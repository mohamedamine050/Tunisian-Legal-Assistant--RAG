Privileges that are not declared to be of public interest are renewable and may be renewed for the benefit of their holders, while retaining the possibility of introducing modifications deemed necessary by public or economic interests to the original terms of the privilege. At the end of the term of the privilege, the lands, buildings, and installations that constitute the real estate dependencies of privileges declared to be of public interest must revert to the state free of charge and in good condition and free of any encumbrances.
