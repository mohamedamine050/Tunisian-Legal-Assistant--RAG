If a landowner extracts water from his land through excavations or works carried out underground, authorized by a permit, then the owners of the lower lands are required to allow the water to flow in the most reasonable and least harmful direction. These owners have the right to compensation in the event they suffer any damage resulting from the flow of the aforementioned water.
