The banks of designated valleys, lakes, and marshes, as determined by order, shall be subject to a right of way known as the "free bank easement", extending three meters from the bank. This right is solely for the free passage of administrative personnel and equipment, and does not grant any right to compensation. No new construction, fences, or plantings shall be erected within the areas subject to the easement without prior authorization from the Minister of Agriculture.
