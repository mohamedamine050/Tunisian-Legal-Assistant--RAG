Urban sanitation projects must establish rapid and stagnation-free disposal networks for all human or animal waste that could cause putrefaction or foul odors. These networks must be located far from residential areas. Moreover, the implementation of these sanitation projects must not result in the contamination of groundwater, regardless of its type, as well as watercourses, lakes, and the coastline in a manner that poses a risk to residents of the residential community, other potential users, or personnel responsible for the maintenance and operation of the facilities.
