If the public interest so requires, authorization or acceptance may be granted for the connection of private subsidiary sewage networks or treatment plants, provided that they do not meet the characteristics of the receiving watercourse. This shall be done in accordance with the conditions set by the Minister of Agriculture. This connection may be contingent upon the contribution of the concerned private entity to the additional construction costs and, where applicable, to the operating costs resulting from the supply of wastewater. In the event that the works imposed on the entity are not completed within the deadline set for achieving the aforementioned connection to public facilities, the necessary works shall be carried out obligatorily at the expense of the party concerned after their assessment.
