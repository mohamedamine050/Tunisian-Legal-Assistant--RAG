The area of the protected zone for the exploitation of water channels, galleries, and their management is determined by the Minister of Agriculture. This area, whose boundaries are clearly defined on the ground, may be subject to:

* **Expropriation for public interest** or
* **Temporary occupation**.

In the latter case, the owners concerned must allow the construction of water channels, pipes, canals, or drains on their land in exchange for full compensation for the resulting damages. This is only applicable if the execution of these works cannot be carried out in another way without incurring exorbitant costs.
