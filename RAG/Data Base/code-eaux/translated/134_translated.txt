The discharge of non-domestic wastewater into public ditches shall be authorized by the Minister of Agriculture, after obtaining the opinion of the group that owns the facilities through which the wastewater passes before reaching the natural environment. This discharge, once authorized, may be subject to preliminary treatment on an individual basis or, as necessary, to collective treatment. In this situation, and if the implementation of the preliminary treatment facilities is found to be lacking, the administration reserves the right to undertake the construction of the aforementioned facilities at the expense of those concerned after issuing a warning to them. Furthermore, they are obligated to contribute to the costs of maintaining the facilities and their operational expenses.
