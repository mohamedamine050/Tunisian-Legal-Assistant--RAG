Every owner has the right to use and dispose of rainwater falling on his land. For this purpose, he may exercise the right of passage through lower lands according to the most efficient and least damaging method. If the use of these waters or the direction given to them exceeds the natural easement relating to the flow of water, a fine shall be paid to the owner of the lower land. Disputes arising from the establishment, exercise, and payment of fines due to lower landowners, as required, shall be submitted to the courts.
