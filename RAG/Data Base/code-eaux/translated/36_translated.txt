Any person, whether natural or legal, who desires to use water in which they have obtained a right of usufruct for the benefit of their property, may obtain passage for this water through underground channels in intervening lands, subject to the most restrictive conditions and those least damaging to the current and future exploitation of the lands, on condition that they pay a fair and advance compensation to the owners of the intervening lands. Disputes arising from the establishment of easement rights or those relating to the determination of the distance, size, and shape of the water channel, as well as the compensation to be paid, whether to the owner of the land traversed or the owner of the land receiving the water, shall fall under the jurisdiction of the courts. Disputes concerning compensation may halt the works. The same easement rights may be claimed, subject to the same conditions, for water used for irrigation, drainage, and sewage channels. However, these rights are excluded for homes, yards, courtyards, gardens, and stables adjacent to the inhabitants.
