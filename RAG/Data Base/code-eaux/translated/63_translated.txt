Licenses and concessions not declared to be in the public interest shall be subject to the payment of a fee to the state, calculated based on the number of cubic meters of water that can be deducted, as determined by an adjustable calculation table established by a joint decision of the Ministers of Finance and Agriculture.

In the event that the landowner does not exploit the land themselves, the collection of the fees shall be made from the exploiter. If the said exploiter is unable to pay, the collection shall be made from the owner.
