With regard to the construction of dams to protect private property from watercourses, the necessity of such construction is not to be proven to the administration, and the protected properties shall bear the cost of protection only in proportion to their interest in the aforementioned works. The State may grant a subsidy for the completion of these works, depending on the public interest involved, particularly on the feasibility of development from an economic standpoint, and the inclusion of the planned development within a wider framework, whether regional or national. The amount of the subsidy shall be determined by a decision of the Minister of Agriculture.
