Specifically, the right of usufruct may be modified by the implementation of a comprehensive program to revive irrigation in the concerned area, within the framework of maximizing the exploitation of cubic meters of water, prioritizing the satisfaction of drinking water needs. This revitalization program, initiated either by the administration or the usufructuaries, shall be subject to a thirty-day administrative review after consideration of observations or objections from the concerned interested group and then by the National Water Council. The revised program, if any, shall become binding on all parties after approval by the Minister of Agriculture. Disputes arising from the modifications made to the aforementioned rights of usufruct shall be referred to the competent courts, which may only issue judgments granting damages to the aggrieved parties.
