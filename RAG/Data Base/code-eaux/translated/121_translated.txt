A protection zone shall be established around every excavation, well, spring, or any other facility intended to supply cities and villages with potable water. The boundaries of the protection zone shall be determined by a decision of the Minister of Agriculture in each case, and shall comprise:

1) **A direct protection zone**, whose land shall be subject to complete ownership acquisition and shall be fenced by the entity responsible for water supply and distribution for the provision of potable water.
2) **A proximate protection zone**, within which deposits or activities that could directly or indirectly lead to the contamination of the water source are prohibited. The list of prohibited deposits and activities shall be determined by a decision of the Minister of Agriculture and the Minister of Health.
3) **A remote protection zone**, as needed, where the deposits and activities referred to in the previous two paragraphs may be regulated.  Direct protection zones for potable water supply facilities may be subject to eminent domain.  In the event that the restrictions stipulated in paragraphs two and three of this chapter actually prevent the use of land already developed, the owner shall be entitled to claim compensation.
