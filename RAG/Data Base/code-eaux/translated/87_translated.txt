(Repealed and replaced by Law No. 116 of 2001 dated November 26, 2001) - Water resources development is defined as operations aimed at adding water quantities to the national water stock by exploiting non-traditional sources. Water resource development can be achieved particularly through the following methods:

- Reusing treated wastewater for productive or service purposes.
- Using brackish water subject to compatibility with production elements and extracted products.
- Desalination of brackish, saline, sea, and brine water, among others, using technological models that minimize environmental pollution from production waste and salt concentration.
- Improving the quality of available water.
- Recycling wastewater in the direct activity and reusing it within the same establishment or by the same user.
- Artificial groundwater recharge, regardless of the source of the water.
