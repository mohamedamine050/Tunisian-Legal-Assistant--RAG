The discharge areas and points of wastewater originating from irrigated areas shall be selected in a manner that avoids the salinization and consequent spoiling of adjacent lands. In the event that technical constraints render such avoidance impossible, a fine shall be levied upon the owners whose lands have been spoiled, commensurate with the damage sustained.
