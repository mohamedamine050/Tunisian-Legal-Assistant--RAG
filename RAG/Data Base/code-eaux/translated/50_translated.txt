Neighbors of irrigation or drainage canals declared to be of public interest by the administration are obligated to allow the free passage and use of mechanical equipment intended for the works of the contractor on their lands and within a width of four meters from the bank of the drainage or irrigation canal. They must also allow the deposit of cleaning materials in certain areas. The area subject to the right of easement for the aforementioned purposes may extend to twice the width between the free banks of the irrigation or drainage canal. In the absence of a sale by mutual agreement, the expropriation of lands subject to the right of easement for deposit becomes mandatory.  New constructions, the erection of permanent fences within the areas subject to the easement relating to passage or deposit, as well as plantings, require prior authorization from the Minister of Agriculture.
