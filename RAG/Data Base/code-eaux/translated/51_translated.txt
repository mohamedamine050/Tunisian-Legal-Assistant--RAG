Any owner of land burdened with a right of deposit may at any time demand from the beneficiary of the aforementioned right to purchase the land. If no response is given to this demand within one year, the owner may file a lawsuit in court to obtain a written judgment from the court determining the amount of compensation. The amount of compensation is calculated in the same manner as expropriation for public interest.
