The reuse of treated wastewater for agricultural purposes is not permitted unless it has been adequately treated at the wastewater treatment plant and a decision is made by the Minister of Agriculture, following the approval of the Minister of Health.

The reuse of treated wastewater, even if it has been treated for irrigation or for watering vegetables that are consumed raw, is prohibited in all cases.
