Conservation areas may be designated by order taken after consulting with a committee, established through a formal process, to gather individuals with relevant expertise from across the public domain of water, concerning the water layers where the proportion and amount of current exploitation of water resources is feared to compromise the preservation of water both in terms of quantity and quality.  Drilling operations for underground water layers and their exploitation within these areas are subject to a license from the Minister of Agriculture, except for repair or exploitation works of existing facilities.
