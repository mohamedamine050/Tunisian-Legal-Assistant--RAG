Treated water may be discharged into the wadi if it does not contain any mixed, suspended, or dissolved substances that, upon discharge into the wadi, would result in the formation of deposits on the banks or in the wadi bed, or give rise to foul-smelling emissions that could cause injury or poisoning to persons, animals, or plants, or contribute to the growth of disease-carrying germs or harmful insects, or directly or indirectly impede the normal use of water downstream of the discharge point.
