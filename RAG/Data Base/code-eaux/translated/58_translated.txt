Concessions are granted within the limits of reasonable water availability, determined based on lists, measurements, inspections, statistics, and calculations available to the administration. The State shall not be subject to any penalty if the actual volume available does not reach the volume that is the subject of the concession and constitutes the maximum limit that should not be exceeded.
