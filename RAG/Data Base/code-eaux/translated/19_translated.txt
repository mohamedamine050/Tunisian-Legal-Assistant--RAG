Within a Water Resource Development Area, every owner or operator of facilities for diverting, confining, or collecting groundwater must submit a declaration notifying the authorities of their facility. It appears that certain types of facilities with minimal impact on the water system may be exempted from the aforementioned declaration. Such exemptions are determined by the order establishing the Water Resource Development Area, as stipulated in Article 16 of this Code.
