Notwithstanding the provisions stipulated in Chapters 107 to 123 of this Code, the conditions under which the pouring, flowing, casting, and depositing of water, directly or indirectly, or of other substances, and, more generally, the performance of any act that could alter the quality of water or the substances present in the subsoil, may be regulated or prohibited shall be determined by an order issued after consultation with the Higher Council for Public Health and the National Water Council.

The aforementioned order shall specify, in terms of technical characteristics, the physical, chemical, biological, and bacteriological standards that must be met by rivers, canals, lakes, dams, ponds, or any body of confined water, in general, particularly with respect to water intakes that ensure the supply of the population. It shall also specify the time frame within which the quality of each water-susceptible environment must be improved in a manner that meets the interests specified in Chapter 107 of this Code, balancing these interests. 

The order shall also clarify the conditions under which:

(1) The pouring, flowing, casting, and depositing of water, directly or indirectly, may be regulated or prohibited, taking into account the aforementioned provisions and, more generally, any act that could alter the quality of surface water or groundwater.

(2) The chemical, biological, and bacteriological characteristics of the resulting water and the pouring operations are monitored, particularly the conditions under which samples are taken and analyzed. This order shall specify, as needed, for each watercourse, canal, lake, dam, groundwater, and other confined water, the specific conditions to which the aforementioned provisions apply, as well as the deadlines for complying with the aforementioned provisions in relation to existing installations.

In all cases, the rights of third parties against polluters shall be preserved.
