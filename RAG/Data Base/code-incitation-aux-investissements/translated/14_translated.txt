The Authority proposes to the Council policies and reforms related to investment, in consultation with structures representing the private sector. It also monitors the implementation of these policies, disseminates relevant information on investment, and prepares evaluation reports on investment policy.

The Authority reviews requests for grant utilization and approves the allocation of these grants based on a technical report prepared by the relevant structure that monitors the progress of the investment. This report takes the form of a communication that is formulated in a near-final state for future access.

The Authority's relationship with structures involved in investment is governed by framework agreements approved by the Council.
