**Investment is free.**

Investment operations shall comply with the legislation governing the exercise of economic activities.

A government order shall establish, within a period not exceeding one year from the date of issuance of this law, a list of activities subject to licensing and a list of administrative licenses required to undertake the project, along with the timeframes, procedures, and conditions for their issuance, based primarily on the requirements of national security and defense, rationalization of support, preservation of natural resources and cultural heritage, environmental protection, and public health.

Any decision to refuse a license must be justified and communicated to the applicant within the legal timeframes, in writing or by any means leaving a written trace.

Silence after the expiry of the timeframes specified in the third paragraph of this chapter shall be considered as granting a license if the application meets all the required conditions. In this case, the authority shall issue the license after verifying that the conditions and timeframes have been respected in the event of silence after the expiry of the timeframes.

Some activities may be exempted from the provisions of the preceding paragraph by government order.
