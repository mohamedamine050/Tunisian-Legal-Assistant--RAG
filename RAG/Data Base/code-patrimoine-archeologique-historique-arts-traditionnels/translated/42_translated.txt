The Minister responsible for heritage may issue a precautionary decision to protect a built or unbuilt property whose preservation constitutes a public interest from a historical, scientific, archaeological, artistic or traditional standpoint, if the latter is exposed to certain risks that require immediate intervention to prevent collapse, demolition or serious disfigurement.

The Minister may also halt works that are detrimental to the property's structure, ornamentation, or authenticity.

The owner or occupant shall be informed of this decision.
