## English Translation:

Historic landmarks, as defined in Chapter 4 of this Code, are protected by a decision issued by the Minister responsible for Heritage, either upon his own initiative or upon a request from any person having an interest therein, after obtaining the opinion of the National Heritage Committee.

This protection decision may extend to built-up or unbuilt-up land belonging to private individuals or to public property adjacent to the historic landmarks, if the protection of such land is deemed necessary for the protection and preservation of the historic landmarks.
