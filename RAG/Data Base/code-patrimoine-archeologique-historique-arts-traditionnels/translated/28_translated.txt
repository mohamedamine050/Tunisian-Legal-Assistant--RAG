No work aimed at the restoration, repair, alteration, addition, or reconstruction of protected properties may be undertaken without prior authorization from the Minister responsible for heritage.

Furthermore, the total or partial demolition of protected properties is prohibited, as is the removal of any parts thereof. 

The relevant authorities must inform the Minister responsible for heritage if a protected building is in a state of collapse. Pending the necessary measures, any action that could lead to the partial or complete demolition of the building or any alteration thereto is prohibited, except for support work that must be carried out by the owner of the protected property to prevent imminent danger.
