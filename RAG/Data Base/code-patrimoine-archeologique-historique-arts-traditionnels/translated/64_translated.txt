No work aimed at the restoration, repair, alteration, addition, or reconstruction of protected properties can be undertaken without obtaining prior authorization from the Minister responsible for Heritage.  Furthermore, the demolition of protected properties, in whole or in part, is prohibited, as is the severance of any part thereof. The relevant authorities are required to inform the Minister responsible for Heritage if a protected building is in a state of collapse that poses a threat of falling. Pending the measures to be taken, any action that could cause the partial or complete demolition of the building or any alteration thereto is prohibited, except for support work to be carried out by the owner of the protected property to avert imminent danger.
