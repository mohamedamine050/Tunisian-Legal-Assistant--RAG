The owner of land has no right to excavate on it, nor does he have the right to claim ownership of any archaeological discoveries that may be found on its surface or in its depths. Furthermore, he does not have the right to enjoy these discoveries. 

Regardless of the provisions of Article 25 of the Real Rights Code, both the accidental discoverer and the owner of the land where the discovery was made, if they report the discovered objects to the relevant authorities of the ministry responsible for heritage, are entitled to a reward determined by a committee.  

This committee, constituted and regulated by an order, is a formal method of bringing together experts from different parts of the institution.
