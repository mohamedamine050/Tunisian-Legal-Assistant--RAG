For the purposes of this Law, "movable property" refers to movable cultural property that has been recognized as having national or international value due to its historical, scientific, aesthetic, artistic, or traditional character. (Repealed and replaced by the first article of Decree No. 43 of 2011, dated May 25, 2011)

Movable property consists of individual pieces or collections.

A collection is defined as an indivisible unit, either because its components share a common origin or because they are connected by choices or a methodology that expresses a particular thought, behavior, identity, taste, knowledge, art, or event.
