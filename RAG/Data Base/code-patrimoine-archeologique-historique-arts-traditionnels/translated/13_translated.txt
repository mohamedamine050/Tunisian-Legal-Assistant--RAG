The "Protection and Revival Example" includes a model for areas and regulatory provisions. These regulatory provisions are established by **administrative decisions of a general nature not related to any specific person**. They specifically regulate:  the activities authorized within each area, the conditions for engaging in those activities, and the specific easements for each area.  All types of work within the cultural site are subject to the **specific regulatory provisions established by the approval order**, effective from the date of approval of the Protection and Revival Example.  The **regulatory provisions established in Chapters 9, 10, 11, and 12 remain in effect.**
