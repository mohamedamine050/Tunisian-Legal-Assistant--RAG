Any artifact, relic, or tradition left behind by past civilizations or generations, whether discovered on land or at sea, is considered an archaeological, historical, or traditional heritage. This includes real estate, movable property, documents, or manuscripts related to arts, sciences, beliefs, traditions, daily life, public events, or other items dating back to prehistory or history, whose national or international value is established. Archaeological, historical, or traditional heritage is considered public property of the state, except for items where private individuals have legally proven their ownership.
