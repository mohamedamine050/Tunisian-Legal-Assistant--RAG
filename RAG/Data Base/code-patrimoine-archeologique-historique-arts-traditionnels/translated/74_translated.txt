Movable property belonging to private individuals is protected by a decision of the Minister in charge of Heritage, with the consent of the owner and after consulting the National Heritage Committee.  In the event of non-consent, the owner may be compelled to accept the protection by an order issued upon a petition from the Governor of the region where the owner of the movable property resides. In the event of its sale, the right of first refusal to purchase may be exercised in accordance with the procedures set forth in Article 89 of this Code.
