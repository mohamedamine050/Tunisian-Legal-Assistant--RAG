(Amended by Law No. 35 of 2001 dated April 17, 2001).

It is hereby stipulated that the transfer of the mortgage, a formal contract by which the creditor acquires a real right over a property designated for the satisfaction of his debt, enabling him to take precedence over ordinary creditors and subsequent creditors in the recovery of his right from the proceeds of that property, regardless of its possession, shall include mortgages registered by way of substitution or other methods in the land registry.


This stipulation empowers the assignee or the successor of the assignee the right to dispose of the registration and to lift the mortgage.


If this is not stipulated, substitution or discharge is an established mechanism in real estate mortgages, and its legal regime differs between registered and unregistered properties.  The discharge issued by the registered creditor can be challenged by the creditor to whom the secured debt has been transferred.
