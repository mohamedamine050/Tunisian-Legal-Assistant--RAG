Mortgage

The formal mortgage is a contract by which the creditor acquires a real right over a property designated for the satisfaction of his debt.  By virtue of this right, he may take precedence over ordinary creditors and creditors subsequent to him in rank in recovering his right from the price of that property, in whosoever's hands it may be.

The right established on a property follows the property into whichever hands it passes.
