If the mortgage is a formal mortgage, by this contract the creditor acquires a real right over a property allocated to the satisfaction of his debt, by virtue of which he may take precedence over ordinary creditors and creditors subsequent to him in rank in the recovery of his right from the price of that property, whichever hand it may be in.  If the mortgage consists of commercial papers or similar instruments payable at a certain date, then the creditor must collect the principal and appurtenances whenever the due date arrives and take all conservatory measures that the debtor cannot take personally due to not possessing the instrument.

The privilege is transferred to the collected assets or to the given thing upon its delivery.  If this thing is a property or a property right, the mortgagee creditor acquires a mortgage on that property or property right.
