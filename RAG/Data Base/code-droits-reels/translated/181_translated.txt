Easements are either continuous or discontinuous.

Continuous easements are those whose use, or potential use, is continuous without the need for any current human action, such as watercourses, gutters, and outlets, and the like.

Discontinuous easements are those whose use requires a current human action, such as a right of way, the right to draw water, and the like.
