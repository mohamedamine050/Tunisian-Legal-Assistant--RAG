(Amended by Law No. 10 of 1995, dated January 23, 1995).

Judgments of the Real Estate Court are not subject to any form of appeal.

However, a party may request a review of judgments issued by the Real Estate Court within two months of their issuance in the following instances:

1. The judgment relies on a law that has been subsequently repealed or amended, rendering it inapplicable.

2. The existence of a prior written court judgment resolving a legal or factual issue in a civil case that contradicts the Real Estate Court judgment, previously added to the registration file.

3. If the judgment did not consider documents that were part of the file and which have a direct impact that could alter the outcome of the case.

4. The existence of a prior written court judgment resolving a legal or factual issue in a case registered earlier that contradicts the judgment forming the subject of the review request.  The Real Estate Court may, in this instance, undertake the review on its own initiative without time limit.

Furthermore, any party with an interest may request a review of judgments based on evidence subsequently proven false or forged by a final judgment. A review request is not admissible after two months from the date of the final judgment, or if the acquisition of the property by a third party in good faith is established.

The review request shall be examined by the assembled chambers of the Real Estate Court, composed of the Court President or the First Deputy President and four Deputies who did not previously participate in the judgment.

The review request is submitted to the President of the Real Estate Court by an application filed by a lawyer admitted to the Court of Cassation or the Public Prosecutor in cases where the State is a party.  The application must include a statement of the reasons for the review request, supported by relevant evidence.

If the Court President deems the request serious, authorization will be given for its registration after the applicant provides a security deposit of 50 dinars and after notification to the Real Estate Registry Office for the entry of a provisional annotation on the land registry document. Otherwise, authorization will be given to suspend the execution of the judgment and this will be noted in the Court register in accordance with the provisions of Article 353 of this Code. The State and local authorities are exempt from providing the security deposit.

The Court clerk shall summon the interested parties to the hearing.

The assembled chambers shall rule on the request. If they find grounds for annulment, they shall examine the case itself; in case of rejection, they shall order the forfeiture of the security deposit and authorize the cancellation of the provisional annotation or the entry in their registers. Their decisions are final.
