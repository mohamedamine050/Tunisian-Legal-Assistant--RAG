If a river changes its original course and takes a new one, the owners of adjacent properties may acquire ownership of the old course, each in the area extending in front of their land up to a line presumed to be located in the middle of the river. The price of the old course is estimated by experts appointed by the President of the Court, a civil court under the judicial authority which must have its independence within the three branches of government, located in the place where litigation between the specialists takes place.  The President appoints the experts at the request of the Governor of the region.

If the owners of the adjacent properties do not express their wish to acquire ownership at the price determined by the experts within three months following the notification issued to them by the Governor, the old course is sold according to the procedures relating to the sale of state property.

The proceeds from the sale are distributed as compensation to the owners of the lands occupied by the new course, proportionally to the value of the land each has lost.  The price obtained from the sale shall be distributed according to what the contracting parties have agreed upon, whether it exceeds or falls short of the sale price.
