(Amended by Law No. 68 of 1997 dated October 27, 1997).

The bylaws governing the system of shared ownership shall not be established or amended except by a majority of the owners present or represented, each having a number of votes corresponding to their ownership share in the common areas.

However, if the ownership share of one owner exceeds one-half, then the number of votes of that owner shall be reduced to the total number of votes of the remaining owners.

In this case, as well as in other cases of a tie in votes, the tie shall be broken by the vote of the syndicate's president.
