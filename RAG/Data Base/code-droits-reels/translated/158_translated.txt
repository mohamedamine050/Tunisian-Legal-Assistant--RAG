The owner of the property requests the termination of the usufruct right due to the usufructuary's mismanagement of the property.

The usufructuary's creditors may intervene in the proceedings to protect their rights and may propose the repair of any damage and the provision of guarantees for the future.

The court, depending on the circumstances, may rule either on the termination of the usufruct right or on the surrender of the property to its owner, while imposing an annual payment to be made by the owner to the usufructuary or to the person to whom their right has been transferred, until the end of the usufruct term.
