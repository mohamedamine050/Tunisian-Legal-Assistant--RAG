If the branches of trees extend onto the neighbor's property, the neighbor has the right to compel the owner to cut them back to the boundary of his property, and any fruit that naturally falls onto his land belongs to him.

However, if the roots extend into his land, he may cut them himself up to the boundary of his property.
