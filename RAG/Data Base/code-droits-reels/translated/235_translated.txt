If the security is in danger of deterioration or destruction, the creditor must immediately inform the debtor, who may then recover the official mortgage, which is a contract whereby the creditor acquires, on a property allocated to the satisfaction of his debt, a proprietary right enabling him to take precedence over ordinary creditors and subsequent creditors in the recovery of his right from the price of that property, whoever may possess it, and be compensated with an equivalent replacement.

In the event of confirmation, the creditor must obtain authorization from the competent judicial authority to sell the official mortgage, which is a contract whereby the creditor acquires, on a property allocated to the satisfaction of his debt, a proprietary right enabling him to take precedence over ordinary creditors and subsequent creditors in the recovery of his right from the price of that property, whoever may possess it, after verifying its condition and valuation by an expert appointed for this purpose, and the judicial authority shall decide on any necessary measures in the interest of both parties.

The proceeds from the sale shall replace the official mortgage, which is a contract whereby the creditor acquires, on a property allocated to the satisfaction of his debt, a proprietary right enabling him to take precedence over ordinary creditors and subsequent creditors in the recovery of his right from the price of that property, whoever may possess it. However, the debtor may request its securing in a public fund or its recovery after providing the creditor with another security of equivalent value.
