If a part of the building is subject to a right of usufruct, then its holder shall be legally a member of the "Owners' Syndicate" under the same title and conditions as the owner of the freehold.

And if the usufructuary and the owner of the freehold disagree, then only the vote of the one obligated to actually contribute to the costs shall be considered.
