(Amended by Law No. 35 of 2001, dated April 17, 2001).

The State shall be liable for damages:

[1] Harm caused in violation of the law affecting a person's body, mental or psychological health, honor, property, or reputation; [2] loss or damage to property, deprivation of comfort, or impairment of physical well-being, reputation, or the like.  In crimes and quasi-crimes, damage is the loss actually suffered by the claimant, and the necessary expenses that he has been or will be compelled to incur to repair the consequences of the act committed to his detriment, as well as what he has been deprived of within the ordinary limits of the consequences of this act, resulting:

First: From the failure of the registration officer to forward documents, or delay in doing so, or failure to observe their order in forwarding them to the Real Estate Registry Administration, in accordance with the provisions of Article 394 of this Code.

Second: From negligence in recording the required registrations in the real estate registry records, in accordance with the law.

Third: From negligence in recording in the title deeds the data established in the land register.

Fourth: From failure to record in the land registers the registrations directly affecting ownership or encumbrances, and in the registers or certificates, the registration or multiple registrations, unless the Real Estate Registry Administration limited itself to the precise execution of the parties' wishes, or the failure to record resulted from a deficiency in data that cannot be attributed to it.
