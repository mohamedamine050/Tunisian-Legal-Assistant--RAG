If the secured party, who is entrusted with the formal mortgage, dies, the formal mortgage is a contract whereby the creditor acquires, over a property allocated to the satisfaction of his debt, a real right which enables him to take precedence over ordinary creditors and creditors subsequent to him in rank in recovering his right from the price of that property, whichever hand it may be in.  If that formal mortgage is deposited with another person appointed by both parties, or by the court in the absence of agreement between them.
