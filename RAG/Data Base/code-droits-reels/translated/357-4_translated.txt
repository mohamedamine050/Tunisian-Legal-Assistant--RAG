The Court of Cassation shall only consider the subject matter of the appeal and decide on its acceptance or rejection.  In the event of acceptance, it shall decide on the annulment of the judgment, wholly or partially, and in all cases, shall order the return of the case to the original or subsidiary Real Estate Court which issued the appealed judgment, for reconsideration of the matters annulled by a different panel.

The decision issued by the Court of Cassation annulling a judgment restores the parties to the situation they were in before the judgment that was annulled, with respect to the matters annulled.

If the referral court rules contrary to this, and this judgment is appealed on the same grounds as the initial annulment, the Court of Cassation, composed of its chambers in plenary session, shall consider the legal issue on which the referral court erred.

If the plenary session finds grounds for annulment, it shall refer the case back to the referral court, and its decision shall be binding.

If an appeal is lodged against a judgment and the Court of Cassation issues a decision of annulment and referral, the clerk of the Court of Cassation shall forward the decision to the President of the Real Estate Court, who shall refer it to the referral panel for reconsideration by a different panel.

If, however, the Court of Cassation issues a decision of rejection, the clerk shall forward the aforementioned decision to the President of the Real Estate Court, who shall forward it, along with the registration judgment, to the Real Estate Registry Office to effect the registration of the property.

The rules governing procedure before the Court of Cassation, as set forth in the Code of Civil and Commercial Procedure, shall apply to appeals of judgments issued in matters of land registration insofar as they do not conflict with the provisions of Chapter Six of this Code.
