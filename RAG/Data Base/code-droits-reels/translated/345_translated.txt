If the registration request is unacceptable with respect to the entire property, or if the registration request does not precisely include the legal status, the Real Estate Court shall authorize the amendment of the description and example, or the undertaking of a new registration process, with or without a survey.

The appeal deadlines are reopened pursuant to this registration, commencing from the date of its publication in the Official Gazette of the Tunisian Republic, or from the date of affixing the survey completion stamp, if the judgment orders such a survey.
