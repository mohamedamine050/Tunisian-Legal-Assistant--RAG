The creditor may not use the mortgage; the formal mortgage is a contract by which the creditor acquires a real right over a property designated for the repayment of his debt, allowing him to take precedence over ordinary creditors and those subsequent to him in rank in recovering his right from the price of that property, whichever hand it may be in.  He may neither mortgage it to a third party nor dispose of it in any other way for his benefit unless explicitly authorized to do so.

Should he contravene this, he shall be liable, even in the event of force majeure, without this precluding compensation for the damages suffered by the debtor or the mortgagor.
