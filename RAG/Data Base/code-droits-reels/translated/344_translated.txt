If the Real Estate Court authorizes a preparatory measure requiring expenses, such as examination, investigation, and site visit, the presiding judge shall estimate those expenses approximately, and the applicant for registration shall deposit them with the court clerk before the authorized measure is carried out.  The court clerk is a judicial officer responsible for maintaining the records and managing the court's documents.
