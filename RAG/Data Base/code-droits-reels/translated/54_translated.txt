The owner of movable property or the holder of a negotiable instrument may recover it from the possessor if it is lost or stolen from him.

If the possessor was in good faith at the time of possession, the claim for recovery lapses after three years from the time of loss or theft.

If the person in whose possession the stolen or lost item is found purchased it in good faith at a public auction or market, or purchased it from someone who trades in such items, he may claim from the person recovering the item the price he paid.  The price paid shall be the amount agreed upon by the contracting parties, whether more or less than the value of the goods.
