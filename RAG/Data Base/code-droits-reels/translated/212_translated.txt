Pledging takes place:

1) By mutual agreement of the parties on its contract.

2) And by the actual delivery of the pledged item to the creditor or to another person agreed upon by the parties.

If the item is in the possession of the pledgor before the contract, this is sufficient for the perfection of the pledge.

The formal pledge is a contract whereby the creditor acquires, on an immovable property allocated to satisfy his debt, a real right which allows him to take precedence over ordinary creditors and subsequent creditors in the same rank in recovering his right from the price of that property, whoever may possess it.  Mutual agreement of the parties is required. If the item is in the possession of a third party acting on behalf of the debtor, it is sufficient that the pledgor informs the person in whose possession the item is; and the third party becomes, from that date, a possessor on behalf of the creditor, even if he is not directly bound to him.
