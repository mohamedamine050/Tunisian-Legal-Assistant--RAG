If one of the heirs requests the appointment of a liquidator for the estate, the competent court president shall, by order based on a petition from the heirs, appoint a liquidator.  This liquidator shall be chosen by the consensus of the heirs or, as far as possible, selected from among the heirs.  The appointment should place a suitable individual in the position, commensurate with the qualifications and competencies required to perform the duties.
