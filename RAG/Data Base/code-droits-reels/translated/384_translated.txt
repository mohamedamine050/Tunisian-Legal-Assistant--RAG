All records kept by the Real Estate Registry administration must have page numbers and must be signed on their first and last pages by the President of the Primary Court.  The Primary Court is usually the first court to hear the dispute and render a decision within its jurisdiction, where the regional administration is located.  The number of pages in the register must also be stated on the first page and signed accordingly.
