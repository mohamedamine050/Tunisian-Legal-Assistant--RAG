If the property cannot be divided in kind, or if such division would cause a significant reduction in the value of the shared property to be divided, this shared property shall be sold by public auction.

The sale shall be conducted in accordance with the rules stipulated for the sale of movable property or the partition of immovable property in the Code of Civil Procedure.  This shall be done to the extent that it does not conflict with the provisions of this chapter and the nature of the partition.

If the partners who have the capacity to dispose of their rights agree to restrict the bidding among themselves, the sale shall proceed without the need for public announcement.

The proceeds shall be distributed among the partners according to their respective shares.
