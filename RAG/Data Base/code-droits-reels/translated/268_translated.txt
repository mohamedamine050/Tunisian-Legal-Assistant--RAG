The mortgage, an official mortgage, is a contract whereby the creditor acquires, over a property allocated to the satisfaction of his debt, a real right which allows him to take precedence over ordinary creditors and creditors subsequent to him in rank in recovering his right from the price of that property, in whichever hands it may be.  The mortgage follows the debt in all circumstances where the payment made to the creditor is declared void, while taking into account the rights acquired during that time and in good faith by a third party.
