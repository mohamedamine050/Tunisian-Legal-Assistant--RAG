The owner may build at any time at the boundary of his land, without being stopped by what his neighbor has constructed in terms of windows, unless they agree otherwise.

The distance specified in the previous section is calculated starting from the exterior face of the wall where the windows are located.  As for balconies and other projections, it is calculated starting from their outer edge to the dividing line between the properties.

Construction within municipal areas is governed by the relevant laws.
