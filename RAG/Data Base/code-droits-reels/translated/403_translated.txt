If the Real Estate Registry Administration omits to register in the land registry a right or several rights that should have been legally registered, then the property in question shall remain in the hands of the new owner free from those rights, and the State shall bear the responsibility where applicable. (This paragraph was amended by Law No. 35 of 2001 dated April 17, 2001).

However, the provisions of the preceding paragraph shall not affect the rights of mortgage creditors in the distribution according to their ranking, unless the buyer has not paid the price agreed upon by the contracting parties, whether it exceeds or falls short of the sale price, or unless the ranking of creditors has not been definitively determined.
