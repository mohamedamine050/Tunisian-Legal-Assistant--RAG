The costs of selling the mortgage are borne by the mortgagor.

The official mortgage is a contract by which the creditor acquires a real right over a property designated to satisfy his debt.  By virtue of this right, he is entitled to priority over ordinary creditors and subsequent creditors in the recovery of his right from the sale price of that property, regardless of the possessor. The debtor bears these costs.

The creditor bears the costs resulting from his fault or negligence.
