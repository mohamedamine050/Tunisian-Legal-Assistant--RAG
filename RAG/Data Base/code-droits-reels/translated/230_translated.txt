Whoever has mortgaged something does not lose his right to sell it, except that the sale issued by the mortgagor is subject to the fulfillment of the debt and its accessories, unless the creditor consents to such sale.  A formal mortgage is a contract by which the creditor acquires, over a property designated for the repayment of his debt, a proprietary right enabling him to take precedence over ordinary creditors and subsequent creditors in the recovery of his right from the proceeds of that property, regardless of possession. The sale is contingent upon the repayment of the principal debt and its accessories, unless the creditor waives this condition.
