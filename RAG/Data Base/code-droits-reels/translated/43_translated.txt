The usurper is a guarantor. [1]  A guarantor is one who undertakes the obligation of another while that obligation remains on the latter, or one who adds his own liability to that of another for what he owes, presently or in the future. [2] This means a person who provides or issues a guarantee, a surety bond payable on demand, a letter of guarantee, or any other form of guarantee, to secure the fulfillment of any obligation in favor of a creditor.  Therefore, if what he usurped is damaged or destroyed, even by a fortuitous event or force majeure, he is liable to pay its value on the date it came into his possession. If it is fungible, he must return an equivalent amount.

If it is only defective, he must return the difference between its value in its present state and its value in its original state. He is liable for the full value if it is rendered useless for its intended purpose.
