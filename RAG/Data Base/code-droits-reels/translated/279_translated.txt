With respect to unregistered real estate, registration in the land registry is replaced by specifying the official mortgage.  The official mortgage is a contract by which the creditor acquires a real right over a property designated to satisfy his debt; by virtue of this right, he may take precedence over ordinary creditors and subsequent creditors in the order of priority in recovering his right from the proceeds of that property, regardless of its possessor.  Registration of ownership is effected by two witnesses.
