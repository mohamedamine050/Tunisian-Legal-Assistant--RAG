If the creditor receives a formal mortgage, this contract grants the creditor, on immovable property designated to satisfy his debt, a real right allowing him to take precedence over ordinary creditors and creditors subsequent to him in rank in the recovery of his right from the price of that property, in whosever possession it may be.  If the creditor receives a movable property or a set of movable properties from someone who does not own it, he does not acquire the right of a formal mortgage on those things, even if he is acting in good faith.
