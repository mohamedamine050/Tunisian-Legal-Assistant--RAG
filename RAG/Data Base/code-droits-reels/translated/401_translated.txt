(Amended by Law No. 35 of 2001 dated April 17, 2001).

If the updated title deed is submitted, registration shall only be effected upon its presentation.

This shall not apply to judicial rulings and administrative instruments, except for those that are contractual in nature.  The Real Estate Registry Office shall enter these rulings and instruments in the land register, specifying the cancellation of the old deed, and inform the owner holding it by registered mail with acknowledgment of receipt, notifying him of the completion of registration and requesting him to return the deed in his possession to the Real Estate Registry Office.

The owner who fails to respond to the Real Estate Registry Office's request within one month of the date of receipt of notification shall be fined 1000 dinars, based on a report drawn up by the Real Estate Registry Office for this purpose and transmitted to the State Attorney at the court within whose jurisdiction the respondent resides.

The submission of the deed to the Real Estate Registry Office shall suspend any pursuit or enforcement of a non-final judgment.
