The costs of returning the mortgage are borne by the debtor, unless otherwise stipulated.

A formal mortgage is a contract by which the creditor acquires a real right over a property designated to satisfy his debt.  By virtue of this right, he is entitled to priority over ordinary creditors and subsequent creditors in the recovery of his right from the proceeds of that property, regardless of its possessor.
