The rules of the lapse of the claim apply.

[1] A claim is a request by one party to another for a right, in the presence of a judge; the requester is called the claimant and the requested party is called the defendant. [2]  A claim is the right of any party with a claim to bring it before the court for judgment on its subject matter.  For the opposing party, it is the right to present reasons for defense or arguments aimed at refuting that claim.

The statute of limitations stipulated in the Code of Obligations and Contracts applies to the lapse of the right to pursue the claim due to non-compliance with the deadlines.  This includes the acquisition concerning the calculation of the period and the suspension of the statute of limitations, and the invocation thereof before the court, and the waiver thereof.
