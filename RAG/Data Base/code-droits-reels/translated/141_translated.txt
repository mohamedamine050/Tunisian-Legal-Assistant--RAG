If the heirs do not agree on the division of the family papers or objects connected to the heirs' sentimental attachment to the deceased, the court shall decide either to sell these objects or to award them to one of the heirs, with or without deduction of their value from his/her share in the inheritance.  In doing so, consideration shall be given to established custom and the personal circumstances of the heirs.
