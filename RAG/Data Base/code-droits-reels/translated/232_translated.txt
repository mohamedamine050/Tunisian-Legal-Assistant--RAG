The creditor does not have the right to seize the mortgage.  The formal mortgage is a contract by which the creditor acquires, on a property designated for the repayment of his debt, a real right enabling him to take precedence over ordinary creditors and creditors subsequent to him in rank in the recovery of his right from the price of that property, in whosever hands it may be.  This is not for other debts incurred by the debtor before the formal mortgage, or after it, unless there is an agreement stipulating that the formal mortgage also secures those debts.
