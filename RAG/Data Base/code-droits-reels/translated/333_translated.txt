The court shall declare the acceptance or rejection, in whole or in part, of the registration application. However, it may authorize the registration of the entire or part of the delimited property in the name of the objector.

The procedure takes place during the court hearing as an attempt by the defense, or one of the parties to the case, often the defendant, to object. Objectors may do so if they so request and their rights are established.

In this case, authorization is always given for a supplementary publication, with or without a delimitation meeting, unless the registration application declares the objectors as co-owners of the property.
