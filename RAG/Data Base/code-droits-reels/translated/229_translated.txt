If a joint and severally liable debtor, or an heir sharing in an inheritance, pays his share of a common debt, he cannot claim the return of the corresponding share of the mortgaged property as long as the debt is not fully paid.

Similarly, a joint and severally liable creditor, or an heir sharing in an inheritance, who has received his share of the debt, cannot return the mortgaged property, lest he prejudice the remaining creditors or heirs who have not yet received their shares.
