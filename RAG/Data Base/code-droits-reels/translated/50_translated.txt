The claim is dismissed.  A claim is a legal procedure initiated by a claimant before a court against another party, which may be an individual or a private entity, wherein the claimant demands a right or compensation for a loss caused by the said party. The claim for ownership is extinguished by prescription. Prescription is the loss of the right to pursue a claim due to non-compliance with deadlines.  The gain is forfeited.
