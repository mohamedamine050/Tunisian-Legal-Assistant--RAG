Upon the debtor's receipt of the mortgage, the mortgagor shall pay the creditor the following:

Firstly: The necessary expenses incurred for the preservation of the mortgage, as well as public dues and costs paid by the creditor. The creditor may remove improvements made to the mortgage, provided this does not cause damage.

Secondly: Damages suffered by the creditor from the mortgaged property, unless such damages resulted from the creditor's fault.  A formal mortgage is a contract whereby the creditor acquires a real right on a property designated to satisfy his debt.  By virtue of this right, he shall have priority over ordinary creditors and creditors ranking after him in the order of preference in recovering his right from the proceeds of that property, whoever may be in possession of it.
