Publication of the judgment ordering the summoning of creditors for consultation on the debtor's proposals regarding the settlement.


Settlement [1] is a consensual contract intended to resolve a dispute and terminate litigation. This is achieved through mutual concessions by the parties involved, either by relinquishing part of their claims or by the delivery of money or rights. [2]  Settlement is a contract by which the parties terminate an existing dispute or prevent a potential one, each reciprocally relinquishing their rights.

The provisional or final judgment granting a protective settlement or a judgment of bankruptcy registered in the land registry prevents the registration of all deeds concluded before or after the cessation of debt payments by the bankrupt debtor or the debtor granted a protective settlement.  All registrations up to the date of this publication may be carried out notwithstanding any judgments contrary to this.
