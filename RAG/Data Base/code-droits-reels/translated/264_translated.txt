The mortgage is extinguished, regardless of the extinction of the original obligation, by the following:

1) The creditor waiving his right in the mortgage.

2) The destruction or damage of the mortgaged property.

3) The concurrence of the mortgage right and the ownership right in one person.

4) The mortgagor rescinding the mortgage right.

5) The expiry of the term or the fulfillment of the condition upon which the rescission of the mortgage is contingent.

6) The assignment of the debt without the mortgage.

7) The sale of the mortgage by a prior creditor with a valid sale.

A formal mortgage is a contract by which the creditor acquires, on an immovable property designated to satisfy his debt, a real right enabling him to take precedence over ordinary creditors and creditors subsequent to him in rank in the recovery of his right from the price of that property, in whosoever's hands it may be.
