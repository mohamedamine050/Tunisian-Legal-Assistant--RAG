Mortgage

The formal mortgage is a contract by which the creditor acquires, on a property designated to satisfy his debt, a real right which enables him to take precedence over ordinary creditors and creditors ranking after him in order of priority in recovering his right from the price of that property, whoever may possess it.  A mortgage registered to secure a future, potential, or conditional obligation, due on a future date or subject to a condition, ranks from the date of its completion by delivery of the mortgaged property according to the contract, even if the obligation is not fulfilled until after that date.

This ruling applies to a mortgage  conditional upon a future date or condition, and to a mortgage on the property of a third party, if valid.
