The partners may agree to enjoy the shared property by way of a usufruct.  In this case, each of them may dispose of his own share, with or without consideration, throughout the specified period allotted to him. He is then not required to account to his partners for what he has received. However, he may not do anything that would hinder or diminish the rights of his other partners during the specified period of their usufruct.
