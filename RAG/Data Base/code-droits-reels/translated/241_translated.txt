The creditor asks about the mortgage.

The official mortgage is a contract by which the creditor acquires a real right over an immovable property designated to satisfy his debt, by virtue of which he may take precedence over ordinary creditors and those subsequent to him in rank in the recovery of his right from the price of that property, in whosever hands it may be, according to its value on the day he receives it, plus damages.

Damage [1] is harm caused in violation of the law affecting a person's body, mental or psychological health, honor, property, or reputation; [2]  loss or damage inflicted on property, deprivation of comfort, or harm to physical well-being, reputation, or the like.  In crimes and quasi-crimes, damage is the actual loss suffered by the claimant, and the necessary expenses that he has been or will be compelled to spend to repair the consequences of the act that caused him harm, as well as what he has been deprived of within the normal limits of the consequences of this act, if any.
