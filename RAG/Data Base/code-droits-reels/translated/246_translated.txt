The following actions are extinguished after six months:

A.  Claims for compensation made by a debtor or a lender; claims relating to a mortgage; claims against a creditor due to defects or alterations in the mortgage. A mortgage is a formal contract whereby a creditor acquires a real right over a property dedicated to the repayment of his debt, allowing him to take precedence over ordinary creditors and subsequent creditors in the recovery of his right from the proceeds of that property, regardless of its ownership.

B.  Claims by a creditor against a debtor for necessary expenses incurred in relation to the mortgage; as well as for the removal of improvements which he is entitled to remove. A mortgage is a formal contract whereby a creditor acquires a real right over a property dedicated to the repayment of his debt, allowing him to take precedence over ordinary creditors and subsequent creditors in the recovery of his right from the proceeds of that property, regardless of its ownership.


This period runs from the day the debtor receives the mortgage for the debtor, and from the day the contract expires for the mortgagee creditor.
