Land that is displaced from its location due to an event caused by force majeure to lower-lying land, may its owner, if it is possible to identify it, claim it within the year following the incident. If the year elapses and he does not claim it, his right to claim is forfeited, unless the owner of the land to which it has shifted has not taken possession of it.
