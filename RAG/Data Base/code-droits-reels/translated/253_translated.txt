The proceeds of the sale shall legally belong to the creditor to the extent that they satisfy his debt, and he may recover the balance from the debtor if the proceeds do not satisfy the debt in full.

If the proceeds exceed the amount of the debt, the creditor shall return the surplus to the debtor or to the mortgagor.

A formal mortgage is a contract by which the creditor acquires, over a property designated for the satisfaction of his debt, a real right allowing him to take precedence over ordinary creditors and creditors subsequent to him in rank in recovering his right from the price of that property, regardless of who possesses it. This is subject to the rights of other mortgagees subsequent in rank.

In all cases, an accounting shall be carried out with the debtor, and the supporting documents shall be delivered to him. The creditor shall be liable for any consequences arising from his negligence or gross error.
