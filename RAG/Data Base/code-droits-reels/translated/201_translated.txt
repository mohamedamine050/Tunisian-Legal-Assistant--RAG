Contract

The contract is a binding legal agreement that obligates the contracting parties and defines their obligations and rights regarding the specified transaction.  By virtue of this contract, the debtor, or his representative, allocates a movable or immovable property or an incorporeal right to guarantee the fulfillment of an obligation, and grants the creditor the right to recover his debt from that property before other creditors if the debtor fails to fulfill his obligation.
