If the debtor fails to fulfill his obligation, even partially, the creditor may request the sale of the mortgage.

Formal mortgage is a contract by which the creditor acquires, on a property allocated to satisfy his debt, a real right which allows him to take precedence over ordinary creditors and creditors ranking after him in recovering his right from the price of that property, whoever may be in possession of it.  Notification is considered effective after eight days from service. Service is considered effected by the signature of the defendant, or his representative in the presence of the competent official, on a notification document or on the writ of summons to appear at the appointed time; or merely by a notice served by a bailiff to the debtor and, if necessary, to the mortgagor.

The debtor or the mortgagor may oppose this within the aforementioned period by a petition served on the creditor and including a summons for him to appear before the competent court; the sale is suspended due to such opposition.

If the deadline expires without any opposition, the creditor may request authorization by petition to sell the mortgage.

If the opposition is rejected, the creditor may sell the mortgage without needing to request authorization.

The sale shall be conducted according to the procedures provided for in the Code of Civil Procedure in the matter of the sale of tangible movable property.
