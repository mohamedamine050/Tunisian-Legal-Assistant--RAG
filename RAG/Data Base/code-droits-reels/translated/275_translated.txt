The official mortgage is a contract whereby the creditor acquires a real right over a property designated to satisfy his debt, enabling him to take precedence over ordinary creditors and subsequent creditors in the order of priority in recovering his right from the proceeds of that property, regardless of its ownership.  Real estate mortgage is only valid with a deed specifying the mortgaged property and the amount of the debt.
