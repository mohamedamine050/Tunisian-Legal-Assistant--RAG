The court shall determine the share of each partner and allocate that which can be distinguished from the joint assets, taking into account in this the interests of the partnership and the partners, and the possibility of exploiting each allocated share to the greatest advantage.

If it is impossible to distinguish each partner's full share in kind, a sum of money shall be awarded to him to adjust the division.
