The creditor is liable for damage to the mortgage.  The official mortgage is a contract by which the creditor acquires a real right over a property designated to satisfy his debt. By virtue of this right, he may take precedence over ordinary creditors and those subsequent to him in order of priority in the recovery of his right from the price of that property, in whomever's possession it may be. He is liable if the damage is due to his act or fault, or the act or fault of persons for whom he is responsible.

He is not liable for fortuitous events and force majeure, except if preceded by his delay and fault.  The burden of proving the fortuitous event and force majeure rests upon him. Any clause holding the creditor liable for fortuitous events or force majeure is void.
