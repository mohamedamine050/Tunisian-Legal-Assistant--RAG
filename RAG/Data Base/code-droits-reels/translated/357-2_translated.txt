An appeal by way of Cassation may be lodged against judgments ordering registration or registration resulting from a judgment of registration before the Court of Cassation in the following cases:

Firstly: If the judgment is based on a violation of the law, or an error in its application or interpretation.

Secondly: If the judgment was issued beyond the jurisdiction of the court that issued it.

Thirdly: If there is an abuse of power.

Fourthly: If the procedures or the judgment did not respect the formal requirements, the non-observance of which the law renders void or null and void.

Fifthly: If two or more judgments ordering registration of the same property were issued.

Sixthly: If the judgment was issued against a person lacking legal capacity without proper representation in the case, or if there was clear negligence in their defense, and this was the original or sole cause of the challenged judgment, taking into account the provisions of Articles 329 and 330 of this Code.

Seventhly: If the challenged judgment is based on evidence whose forgery or fraud has been definitively established by a final judgment; however, the appeal by way of Cassation is inadmissible if acquisition of ownership of the property by a third party in good faith is established.
