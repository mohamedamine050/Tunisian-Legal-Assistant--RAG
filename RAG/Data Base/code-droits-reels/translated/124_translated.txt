The co-sharers guarantee each other against any disturbance or claim arising prior to the division, each according to their share.  The value of the thing is assessed at the time of the division.

If one of the co-sharers is insolvent, the amount he is liable for shall be distributed among the beneficiary of the guarantee and all the other co-sharers.

There is no guarantee if the type of disturbance or claim is specifically excepted by an express condition in the division agreement, or if the disturbance or claim is due to the fault of the co-sharer.
