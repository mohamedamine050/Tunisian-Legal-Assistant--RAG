Regarding the Mortgage

The official mortgage is a contract by which the creditor acquires a real right over a property designated to satisfy his debt.  By virtue of this right, he is entitled to priority over ordinary creditors and subsequent creditors in the recovery of his debt from the proceeds of that property, regardless of its possessor.

The creditor may assert against the debtor all the debtorâ€™s means of defense, even if the debtor does not consent to it or waives such means, except for those relating to his person.
