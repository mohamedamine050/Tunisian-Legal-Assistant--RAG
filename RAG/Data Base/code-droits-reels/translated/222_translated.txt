If an agreement is reached on the delivery of the mortgage, the formal mortgage contract grants the creditor, on a property allocated to the satisfaction of his debt, a real right by which he may take precedence over ordinary creditors and creditors subsequent to him in rank in recovering his right from the price of that property, in whichever hands it may be.  If the person [to manage the property] is not appointed by the mortgagor and mortgagee, and the person has not been designated, the court shall appoint him from among the persons designated by both parties if they do not agree on his election.
