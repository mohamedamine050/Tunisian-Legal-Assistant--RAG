Creditors who were duly summoned but did not attend until after the division or sale of the property are not entitled to request its annulment. However, if insufficient funds were left to satisfy their debts, they have the right to recover their dues from the remaining undivided share of the property, if any. Otherwise, they may sue the partners.
