Real estate rights pertaining to abandoned property or property sold by forced sale pursuant to release from a mortgage, which the possessor enjoyed or bore prior to the transfer of the property, revert to their previous state after abandonment or forfeiture.

In registered land, if the erasure [of mortgage] occurs through a mixing of assets, then the rights do not revert to their previous state except by new registration, and it is incumbent upon the interested party to request this.  The erasure is a mechanism used in real estate mortgages, and its legal regime differs between registered and unregistered titles.
