Every person may request from the Director of Real Estate Registry, upon submission of the documents required by this Code, the registration of a real right, or the completion, deletion, or amendment of a registration.

However, this right shall not be registered unless it is directly transferred from the person in whose name it was previously registered.

If the real right is the subject of several successive transfers or agreements, the last transfer or agreement shall not be registered before the registration of the preceding transfers and agreements.
