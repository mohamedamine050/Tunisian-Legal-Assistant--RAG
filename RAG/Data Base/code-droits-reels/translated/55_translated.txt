The possessor, even if a usurper, who alters the movable property and increases its value significantly in relation to its essence, shall have the property confiscated, provided that he compensates for the value of the original material plus an amount to be determined at the court's discretion.  In such a case, the court shall consider the legitimate interests of the original owner, even if they are moral in nature. The rightful owner shall have the option of recovering the property in its altered state, provided he pays the possessor the amount added to its value by his work. In both instances, he shall have priority over other creditors.
