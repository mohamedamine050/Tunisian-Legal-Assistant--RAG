Judgments issued by the Real Estate Court rejecting registration requests are temporary in nature; they do not possess the binding force of judicial decisions and do not prejudice the rights of either party.  The applicant, in particular, may request registration anew based on new evidence establishing their rights.

In no case can a judgment rejecting a case filed before a court of general jurisdiction be relied upon.
