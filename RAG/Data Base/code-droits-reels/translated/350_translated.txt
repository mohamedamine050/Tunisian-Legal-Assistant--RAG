(Amended by Law No. 46 of 1992, dated May 4, 1992).

The Real Estate Court shall deposit deeds and agreements concluded during the period between the submission of the registration application and the original judgment, if the proprietary right contained therein is constituted only by registration in the land registry.

This judgment authorizes the registration of rights acquired after the submission of the registration application.

Rights acquired after the submission of the registration application which have not been deposited in accordance with the provisions of the first paragraph shall only be constituted by their registration in the land registry, and shall take effect from the date of such registration.
