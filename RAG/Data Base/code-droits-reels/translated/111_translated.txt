The party exercising the right of pre-emption must submit his claim accompanied by proof that he offered the buyer the full purchase price and the costs of the contract, or that, upon the refusal of the party benefiting from the pre-emption right, he secured this amount in a deposit and escrow account. This security is not subject to any form of appeal.

The contract is a legally binding agreement that obligates the contracting parties and defines their obligations and rights concerning the specific transaction.  Thereby, the insurer undertakes to pay the insured or the beneficiary a sum of money, a periodic income, or any other financial compensation in the event of the occurrence of the insured event, in exchange for premiums or any other financial payment made by the insured to the insurer.  This requires court authorization.

Any condition aiming to make the price, agreed upon by the contracting parties, unknown, whether exceeding or falling short of the value of the sale, shall be deemed void.
