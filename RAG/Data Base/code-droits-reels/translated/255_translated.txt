If the mortgage is a formal mortgage, by this contract the creditor acquires a real right over a property designated for the satisfaction of his debt, by virtue of which he may take precedence over ordinary creditors and those subsequent to him in rank in recovering his right from the price of that property, in whomever's hands it may be.  If the debt is owed by a third party, the creditor shall have the right to recovery, unless otherwise agreed.

Recovery is the process by which the creditor obtains repayment from his debtor of the financial debt contracted towards him. The creditor may recover the amount of the mortgaged debt to the extent necessary to satisfy his debt and proceed directly against the third party if necessary. The liability of this third party is not legally discharged except by payment of the mortgaged debt; and this payment entails the same consequences as payment made by the original debtor.

If there are multiple mortgage creditors, the right to recovery belongs to the one whose claim is earliest in date. This latter creditor must immediately inform the debtor of the debt collection or of any judicial proceedings undertaken.
