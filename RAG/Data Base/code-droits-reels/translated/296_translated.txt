Every registered creditor or party with an objection may lodge an objection.  The objection is a remedy available to the defaulting party to challenge a decision made in absentia.  It is stipulated that the objection must be filed within forty days of the date of notification of the request by the new owner to sell the property at public auction before the court. This is done by offering an increase in the price agreed upon by the contracting parties, whether it exceeds or falls short of the sale price, by no less than one-sixth. This must be done either personally or through a representative acting in solidarity with the objecting party, who must provide a guarantor for the payment of the price agreed upon by the contracting parties, whether it exceeds or falls short of the sale price, and the costs; otherwise, the proceedings are void.
