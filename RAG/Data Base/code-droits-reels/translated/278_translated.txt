(Amended by Law No. 46 of 1992, dated May 4, 1992).

A formal mortgage is a contract by which the creditor acquires a real right over a property designated to satisfy his debt, enabling him to take precedence over ordinary creditors and subsequent creditors in the recovery of his right from the price of that property, regardless of its possessor.

A real estate mortgage is only constituted after its registration, and the ranking of real estate mortgages is determined according to the rules stipulated in this Code.

Mortgages registered on the same day shall rank equally, and the registration shall last for the duration of the mortgage.
