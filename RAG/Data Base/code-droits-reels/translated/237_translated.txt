In the scenario stipulated in the previous article, as well as in all other scenarios where the creditor misuses the mortgage, the official mortgage is a contract by which the creditor acquires, on a property designated for the repayment of his debt, a real right which allows him to take precedence over ordinary creditors and creditors subsequent to him in rank in recovering his right from the price of that property in whichever hands it may be.  If the creditor abuses the mortgage, neglects it, or exposes it to risk, the debtor shall have the choice between three options:

A.  To request that the mortgage be placed under the care of a custodian, while retaining the right to recourse against the creditor.

B.  Or to compel the creditor to restore the situation to what it was at the time of the creation of the mortgage.

C.  Or to recover the mortgage after payment of the debt, even before its due date.
