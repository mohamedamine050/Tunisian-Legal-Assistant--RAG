(Amended by Law No. 68 of 1997 dated October 27, 1997).

The syndicate president may, on his own initiative or at the request of at least one-third of the owners, convene a general meeting to consider matters relating to the administration of common areas or whenever the interest so requires.

The convocation shall be made by registered letters with acknowledgment of receipt or by written summonses served directly on those concerned against their signatures on receipts.

The general meeting shall not be legal unless half of the owners are present in person or by representation.

Decisions shall be taken by the majority stipulated in Article 91 of this Code.  If it is impossible to convene the meeting with the aforementioned majority, a second convocation shall be addressed within fifteen days of the date set for the first general meeting.

Decisions shall be taken during the second general meeting by a majority of those present, whatever their number and the proportion of their representation of the remaining owners.

The general meeting shall decide on the delegation of such powers as it deems fit to the syndicate president for the management of the property in accordance with the participation system stipulated in Article 90 of this Code.

Furthermore, the head of the local municipality within whose jurisdiction the property lies may authorize the syndicate president or the temporary president appointed in accordance with the provisions of paragraph three of Article 97 of this Code, to convene the general meeting of owners whenever necessary.
