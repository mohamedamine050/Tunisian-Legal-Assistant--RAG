The liability of the creditor to respond to the debtor's actions before the law, or to compensate for the damage caused, ends if the debtor, having fulfilled the debt, notifies the creditor of the receipt of the mortgage.

The official mortgage is a contract by which the creditor acquires, on a property designated for the repayment of his debt, a real right allowing him to take precedence over ordinary creditors and creditors subsequent to him in rank in the recovery of his right from the price of that property, in whichever hand it may be.

The subject matter remains under the responsibility of the creditor, or if the debtor requests the creditor to keep the mortgage under his custody. In these two cases, the creditor is only liable as a trustee.
