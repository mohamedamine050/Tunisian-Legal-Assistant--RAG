If the subject of the mortgage is a specific share of a movable thing, then it is only valid upon delivery of the entire thing to the creditor.

And if the thing is jointly owned by the debtor and others, then it suffices for the validity of the official mortgage that the creditor takes the place of his debtor in possessing the thing.  An official mortgage is a contract by which the creditor acquires, on an immovable property allocated to satisfy his debt, a real right which enables him to take precedence over ordinary creditors and creditors subsequent to him in rank in recovering his right from the price of that property, in whichever hands it may be.
