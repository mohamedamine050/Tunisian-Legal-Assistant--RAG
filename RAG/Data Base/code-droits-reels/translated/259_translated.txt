The ranking among competing mortgage creditors is determined by the date of the contract creating the mortgage.

If they are equal in rank, they shall share the proceeds proportionally to their debts,  based on what the contracting parties agreed upon, whether it exceeds or falls short of the sale price, unless otherwise agreed.
