The mortgage, a formal contract, grants the creditor, on property designated to satisfy his debt, a real right. By virtue of this right, he shall take precedence over ordinary creditors and subsequent creditors in the satisfaction of his claim from the proceeds of that property, in whomever's hands it may be.  This right legally extends to the fruits and appurtenances of the mortgaged property from the time it comes into the creditor's possession, such that the creditor has the right to retain it, along with the principal, as security for the debt. If the mortgaged property is movable, the creditor is authorized to collect its surplus and profits and to retain them as he would the principal.

All of this, unless otherwise stipulated.
