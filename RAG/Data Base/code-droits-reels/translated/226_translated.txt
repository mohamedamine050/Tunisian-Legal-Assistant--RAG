The official mortgage is a contract by which the creditor acquires, on a property allocated to the repayment of his debt, a real right which allows him to take precedence over ordinary creditors and creditors subsequent to him in rank in recovering his right from the price of that property, in whose hands so ever it may be.

In addition to the principal debt, the following are included:

1) Accrued interest.

2) Expenses necessary for the preservation of the mortgage, within the limits stipulated in Article 245.

3) Expenses necessary for the sale of the mortgage.

And damages; [1] harm inflicted in violation of the law affecting a person's body, mental or psychological health, honor, property, or reputation; [2] loss or damage inflicted on property, deprivation of comfort, or harm to physical well-being, reputation, or the like. - In crimes and quasi-crimes, damages are the losses actually suffered by the claimant, the necessary expenses that he has had or will have to incur to repair the consequences of the act that caused him harm, as well as what he has been deprived of within the normal limits of the consequences of this act.  The damages that the creditor can claim, as well as the expenses incurred in pursuing the debtor, are considered a debt owed by the latter, which the creditor can claim according to the law.
