If, among the registered creditors, a creditor has the right to bring an action for rescission and chooses to do so, then he must file his claim within twenty days of notification, including all creditors referred to; otherwise, his right to do so shall lapse.

The purification procedures are suspended from the time the creditor initiates the action for rescission and cannot be appealed except after the creditor withdraws the action for rescission or after its rejection.
