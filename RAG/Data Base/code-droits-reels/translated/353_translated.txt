(Amended by Law No. 10 of 1995 dated January 23, 1995).

During the period between the issuance of the registration judgment and the establishment of the land registry,

the land registry is an official document that proves ownership of the property.  The judgment may be invoked before the courts.

Until the establishment of the land registry,

the land registry is an official document that proves ownership of the property. The court clerk,

a judicial officer responsible for maintaining records and managing court documents, shall accept all instruments and agreements that the parties deem necessary to submit for the preservation of their rights.  He shall then forward them, along with the file, to the land registry keeper to examine and register them upon fulfillment of the legal requirements, according to the order in which they were deposited with the court registry.
