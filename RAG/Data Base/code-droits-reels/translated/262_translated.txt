If the mortgaged property is removed from the possession of the mortgagee without his consent, he is entitled to recover it from the debtor or any other possessor, in accordance with the conditions stipulated in Article 316 of the Code of Obligations and Contracts.  A formal mortgage is a contract by which the creditor acquires a real right over a property designated to satisfy his debt; by virtue of this right, he takes precedence over ordinary creditors and subsequent creditors in the recovery of his right from the proceeds of that property, in whosever possession it may be.
