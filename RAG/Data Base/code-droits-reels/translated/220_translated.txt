The pledging of promissory notes may be effected by delivering the note endorsed in the name of the creditor or to his appointee, provided that such endorsement specifies that the note was delivered as security.  If the endorsement is limited to transferring ownership of the note without specifying that its delivery was as security, then the endorsee becomes the owner of the note.
