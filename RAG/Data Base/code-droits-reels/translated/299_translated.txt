If none of the creditors entitled to do so requests the public auction of the property within the prescribed time and in accordance with the legal procedures, the value of the property shall remain definitively assessed at the price stipulated in the contract or declared by the new owner.

Unless it reaches a rank eligible for participation in the price, the price agreed upon by the contracting parties, whether exceeding or falling short of the sale price, shall be deleted with respect to the excess.

The effect of the order of creditors prepared either by agreement or by litigation in accordance with the Code of Civil Procedure remains.

The new owner shall be released from mortgages either by paying the debts that have become due or those he is at liberty to pay to the creditors with a rank eligible for participation, or by securing payment sufficient to cover those debts.

He shall remain subject to mortgages with a rank eligible for participation in the debts that have not yet become due and which he does not wish or cannot settle.
