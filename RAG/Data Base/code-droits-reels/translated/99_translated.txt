(Amended by Law No. 68 of 1997 dated October 27, 1997).

If the building comprises floors or apartments, and at least two of them are owned by two or more different owners, then cadastral plans are extracted from the original cadastral plan, or from the unified cadastral plan.  The cadastral plan is an official document that proves ownership of the property. These cadastral plans will depict the individual sections based on engineering examples prepared by the Land Survey and Mapping Department or by an approved land surveyor, in accordance with the applicable legal procedures.

The entitlement ratio in the common areas for each individual section is determined by the title deed and according to the applicable technical rules.

The original plan of the divided building, after the extraction of the individual sections, remains inclusive of the common areas.
