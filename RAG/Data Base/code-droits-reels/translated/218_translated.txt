The privilege on debts is established:

A. By delivery of the debt instrument.

B. By informing the debtor whose debt is mortgaged of the mortgage, or by the latter's acceptance thereof by means of a document with a fixed date.

The notification must be made by the original creditor or by the mortgagee after obtaining authorization from the former.

A debt not established by an instrument cannot be validly mortgaged.
