It is not permissible to plant trees or shrubs near a neighbor's land except at the distance specified by the relevant laws or customary practices.  If there are no laws or customary practices, the distance must be two meters from the boundary line between the lands for plantings that exceed two meters in height, and half a meter for plants less than that height.

Trees and shrubs may be planted and trained on both sides of the wall separating two lands without regard to distance, but it is not permissible for them to extend beyond the top of the aforementioned wall.
