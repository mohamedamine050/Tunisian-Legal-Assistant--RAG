If a building or group of buildings is owned by several persons and comprises several floors, apartments, shops, offices, or others, and each is owned by one or more persons, they shall be considered partners in the ownership of the land on which the building is erected and in its common parts not intended for the exclusive use or benefit of one of them.

The parts of the buildings, as well as the land, spaces, passages, walkways, equipment, ducts, guard houses, elevators, staircases, roofs, antennas, and other parts and elements intended for the use or benefit of all or some of the partners, shall be considered common, unless otherwise stipulated in the title deed.

The partitions separating two apartments or shops shall be jointly owned by their owners.

These provisions and those that follow apply to real estate complexes that constitute an integrated architectural unit with common parts and facilities, within the meaning of the second paragraph of this chapter.
