No partner may do anything to the shared property without the express or implied consent of the others.  Should this occur, the following rules apply:

1. If the shared property is divisible, it shall be divided. If the alteration made does not fall within the purview of the one who made it, the partner has the choice between obligating his partner to remove what he has done at the latter's expense, along with compensation for damages. [1] Harm caused by violation of the law affecting a person's body, mental or psychological health, honor, property, or reputation [2] Loss or damage to property, deprivation of comfort, or harm to physical well-being, reputation, or similar. - In crimes and quasi-crimes, damage is the actual loss suffered by the claimant, necessary expenses incurred or to be incurred to repair the consequences of the act committed to their detriment, as well as what they were deprived of within the normal limits of the consequences of that act.  If necessary, this includes the cost of materials and labor, without regard to any possible increase in the value of the property due to the alterations.

2. If the shared property is indivisible, the remaining partners have the same choice. If they choose to pay the cost of materials and labor, each shall pay their share in the property. If the remaining partners disagree, the majority shall decide based on the value of the shares.
