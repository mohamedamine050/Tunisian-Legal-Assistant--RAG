Civil Provisions

The material aspects of civilization, such as infrastructure, communication, and entertainment, are complemented by the intellectual, spiritual, and ethical aspects of civilization.  Benefits accrue daily, with the beneficiary's share proportionate to the duration of their enjoyment.
