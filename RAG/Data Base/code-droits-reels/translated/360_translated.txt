If a property is divided as a result of a partition or division process, then each part thereof shall be individually identified by a sworn engineer who shall specify this process by means of a plan.

A separate and independent plan shall be prepared for each subdivided part of the property.

However, if a part of the property is transferred, there is no need to prepare a new plan for the part not included in the transfer and retained by the owner; and it is permissible to retain the previously submitted plan and the example added thereto after specifying what needs to be specified therein.
