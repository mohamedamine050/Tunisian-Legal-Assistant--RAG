Following the established path is considered public property unless a deed or marker indicates otherwise.

A sign of private ownership of the path is the presence of a structure or, at a minimum, connecting arches between the walls erected on its sides.

If the structure or arches built on the path collapse due to age, accident, or other causes, the owner may not rebuild them except with special permission.

Ownership of the upper part of the path is private ownership, implying joint ownership of the wall on which the arch or structure is built, unless a deed indicates otherwise.
