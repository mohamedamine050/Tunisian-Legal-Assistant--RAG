If there are multiple intercessors for a single property, their ranks are determined as follows:

Firstly: The owner of the land in relation to the owner of its airspace, and vice versa.

Secondly: Joint heirs in an inheritance.

Thirdly: Those sharing in common ownership or in a house, in the manner stipulated in Article 104.

With respect to the latter two categories, the owner of the larger share in the property is given precedence.

If the shares are equal, the order is determined by lot.
