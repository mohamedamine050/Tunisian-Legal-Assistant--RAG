If the mortgage—the official mortgage—is a contract whereby the creditor acquires, over a property designated for the satisfaction of his debt, a real right which allows him to take precedence over ordinary creditors and creditors subsequent to him in rank in recovering his right from the price of that property, in whichever hands it may be.  Different things were [the subject of] the creditor’s right to sell whatever the debtor chooses if it is sufficient to satisfy the debt; otherwise, the creditor must begin by selling what incurs the least benefit to the debtor, to the extent that it satisfies the debt.  He is not permitted to sell except what is necessary to satisfy the debt, and the sale of the surplus is void, in addition to compensation for any harm suffered by the debtor.

The mortgagee creditor must notify the debtor at least forty-eight hours before the appointed time, specifying the day, time, and place of the sale, as well as the opening bid; otherwise, the sale is void.
