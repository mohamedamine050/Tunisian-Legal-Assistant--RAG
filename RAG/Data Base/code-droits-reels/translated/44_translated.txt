Whoever possesses the property of another with a semblance of right is not obligated to return of the produce except that which was extant at the time of the claim by its rightful owner and what accrued to him from that date.

He is, however, entitled to the expenses of preservation and utilization.

Possession with a semblance of right is possession in a manner that the possessor is unaware of its defect.
