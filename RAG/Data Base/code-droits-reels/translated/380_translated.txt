(Amended by Law No. 68 of 1997 dated October 27, 1997).

The Real Estate Registry Office maintains, in addition to the Land Registry records:

1. A register of lodged applications for registration or cancellation.  Cancellation is a mechanism used in real estate mortgages, and its legal regime differs between registered and unregistered charges.  This register records, according to their date of receipt and upon their receipt, the judgments of the Real Estate Court issued for registration, and the documents submitted for registration, and generally all deeds and instruments intended for the completion of registration, annotation, or cancellation.

2. A deposit register recording a summary of the transactions accepted for registration and the date of registration.

The Real Estate Registry Office shall stamp the registers of lodgement and deposit daily.
