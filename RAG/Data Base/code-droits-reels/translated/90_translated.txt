(Amended by Law No. 68 of 1997 dated October 27, 1997).

The owners' association shall adopt a system called "Shared Ownership System" which includes the detailing, defining, and identification of the common areas, and ensures the proper use and management of the shared property.

This system is binding on all owners and all those who have derived a right from them in the property, according to a model system approved by order based on a proposal from the Minister in charge of real estate affairs.

Specific rules responding to the characteristics of the shared property may be added to the Shared Ownership System. These are approved by the group of owners by the majority stipulated in Article 91 of this Code and the procedures specified in the Shared Ownership System.

A copy of the Shared Ownership System shall be deposited at the headquarters of the local municipality in whose district the property is located. Another copy shall be deposited with the Real Estate Registry if the property is registered, to be noted in the relevant property registers.

Arbitration may be stipulated with regard to disputes arising from the application of this system.
