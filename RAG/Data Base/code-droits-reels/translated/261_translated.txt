The secured creditor may not oppose the seizure of the mortgage.  A formal mortgage is a contract whereby the creditor acquires, on property designated to satisfy his debt, a proprietary right which allows him to take precedence over ordinary creditors and creditors subsequent to him in rank in recovering his right from the proceeds of that property, regardless of possession. Or its judicial sale by other creditors.

However, it is permissible to proceed with the seizure, which empowers the creditor holding an executory instrument to place the tangible movables in the possession of his debtor under the control of the court, or under the control of the secured creditors to the extent necessary to satisfy his debt, until he is able to exercise his priority on the proceeds of the sale.

He may also oppose the seizure or sale if the value of the mortgage is insufficient from the outset, or subsequently becomes so, to satisfy the secured creditor.
