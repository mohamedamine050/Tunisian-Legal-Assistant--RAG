It is permissible that the mortgage be official. An official mortgage is a contract by which the creditor acquires a real right over a property designated to satisfy his debt.  By virtue of this right, he may take precedence over ordinary creditors and creditors ranking after him in recovering his right from the price of that property, in whomever's hands it may be.

The mortgage may be cash, bearer bonds, or fungible things, provided that they are delivered in a sealed envelope.

If the cash is delivered in an unsealed envelope, the rules of consumption loan shall apply. However, if bearer bonds are delivered in an unsealed envelope, the creditor may not dispose of them except with the express and written permission of their owner.
