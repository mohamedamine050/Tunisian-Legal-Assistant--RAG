The official mortgage is a contract by which the creditor acquires, on a property allocated to the repayment of his debt, a real right which allows him to take precedence over ordinary creditors and creditors subsequent to him in rank in recovering his right from the price of that property, in whichever hands it may be.  Legally, if the mortgaged property is defective or destroyed, the mortgage extends to what remains of it or its appurtenances, and to what is received as compensation for that defect or destruction.

This also applies to compensation received for its expropriation for the public interest, and the creditor may take any measures deemed necessary to preserve his right to the compensation.
