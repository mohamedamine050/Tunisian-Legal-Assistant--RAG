If a person constructs buildings, plantings, and installations on the land of another without his consent, using his own materials, then the owner has the choice between leaving those things on his land or obligating the constructor to remove them.

If the landowner requests the removal of the things, the costs of removal shall be borne by the constructor, and he shall have no right to any compensation; however, he shall compensate the landowner for any damage that may have been caused.

If the landowner requests that those things remain, he is obligated to reimburse the cost of the materials and the labor costs, without regard to any increase in the value of the land due to those constructions.

If the buildings, plantings, and installations were constructed by a person who has relinquished possession of the land and was a possessor in bad faith, the owner is not entitled to request the removal of what is mentioned, but rather he has the choice between reimbursement of the cost of the materials and labor costs, or the payment of an amount equal to the increase in the value of the land due to those constructions.
