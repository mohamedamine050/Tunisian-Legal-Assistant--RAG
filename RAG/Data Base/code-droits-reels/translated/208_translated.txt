Mortgage

The formal mortgage is a contract by which the creditor acquires a real right over a property designated for the satisfaction of his debt.  By virtue of this right, he may take precedence over ordinary creditors and creditors subsequent to him in rank in recovering his right from the proceeds of that property, regardless of possession.  It is indivisible and remains in its entirety on each part of the thing that is its subject matter, and it secures the entire debt.
