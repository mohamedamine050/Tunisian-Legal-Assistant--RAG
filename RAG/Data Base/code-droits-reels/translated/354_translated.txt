(Amended by Law No. 35 of 2001, dated April 17, 2001).

The Real Estate Registry Office shall place the word "Annulled" on the deeds submitted in support of the registration application and retained by it.

However, if these deeds relate, in addition to the registered property, to another separate property, the Real Estate Registry Office shall, in the joint deed, include the word "Annulled" specifying the registered property based on the judgment issued for registration, and the Real Estate Registry Office shall deliver it to the parties concerned.
