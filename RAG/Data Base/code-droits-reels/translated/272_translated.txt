The mortgage includes the mortgaged property itself, and all its appurtenances and any improvements added to it.  The official mortgage is a contract by which the creditor acquires a real right over a property designated for the satisfaction of his debt.  By virtue of this right, he is given priority over ordinary creditors and those subsequent to him in rank in recovering his right from the price of that property, whomever may possess it.

The registration guarantees three years' interest with a privilege of the same rank as the principal debt, provided that the interest rate is specified in the contract and in the registration.

The various interest and appurtenances are allocated by privilege over others when distributing the proceeds of the sale.

The *aqala* (attachment) which empowers a creditor holding an enforceable instrument to place the tangible movable property in the possession of his debtor under the authority of the court is an enforceable measure that cannot exceed the legal limit.
