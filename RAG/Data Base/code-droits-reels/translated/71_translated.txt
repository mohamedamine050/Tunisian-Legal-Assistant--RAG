No one shall be compelled to remain in co-ownership.  Each co-owner has the right to request partition. Any stipulation to the contrary shall be null and void.  However, the co-owners may agree in writing not to partition for a specified period. The court has the right to rule on the dissolution of the agreement and to proceed with the partition if there is a valid reason.

The term of the agreement shall not exceed five years. If it exceeds this period, it shall be reduced to five years. This term shall not be renewed upon its expiry except by a further written agreement.
