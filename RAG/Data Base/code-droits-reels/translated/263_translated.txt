Reasons for the nullity or extinction of the principal obligation result in the nullity of the mortgage.

The official mortgage is a contract by which the creditor acquires, over a property designated for the satisfaction of his debt, a real right allowing him to take precedence over ordinary creditors and subsequent creditors in the order of priority in recovering his right from the proceeds of that property, regardless of its possessor.

And what results from the lapse of the obligation is subject to Article 390 of the Code of Obligations and Contracts.
