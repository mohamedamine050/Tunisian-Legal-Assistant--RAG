The determination of the rights of minors or other incapacitated persons is initiated by their legal representatives.  If they do not request it, the Public Prosecutor's Office shall undertake it. The Public Prosecutor's Office is the body responsible for defending the interests of society and applying the law before the courts. This may also be initiated by a district judge, relatives, friends, or the incapacitated persons themselves.
