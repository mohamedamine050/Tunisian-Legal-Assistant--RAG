(Amended by Law No. 68 of 1997, dated October 27, 1997).

The Real Estate Registry Office may only refuse or postpone the registration, deletion from registration, reduction of registration, or amendment of registration legally requested, or refuse or postpone the delivery of the ownership deed or documents held by it to the rightful party, or refuse or postpone the delivery of certificates or copies of plans to those requesting them, if there is a legal impediment. (This paragraph was amended by Law No. 35 of 2001, dated April 17, 2001).

A decision of the Real Estate Registry Office to refuse or postpone such actions is subject to appeal before the Real Estate Court within one month from the date of notification.  The silence of the Real Estate Registry Office after four months is considered a refusal. The Real Estate Court shall decide on the appeal after hearing the opinion of the Real Estate Registry Office and, if necessary, shall authorize the performance of the requested procedure. Its decisions are exempt from any notification and are immediately enforceable, while the rights of the parties concerned remain preserved regarding the principal matter.

The appellant may request permission from the President of the Real Estate Court or his representative to provisionally record his appeal. The request shall be referred to the Real Estate Registry Office for its opinion.  If the Real Estate Court authorizes the provisional recording, it shall order its registration.
