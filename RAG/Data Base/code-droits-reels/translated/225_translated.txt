If the mortgaged property is destroyed or impaired by the act of the debtor, the mortgagee may immediately demand payment of the debt, even if it is not yet due, unless the debtor offers another mortgage of equal value or adds another mortgage.  A formal mortgage is a contract by which the creditor acquires a real right over a property designated to satisfy his debt, enabling him to take precedence over ordinary creditors and subsequent creditors in recovering his due from the sale proceeds of that property, regardless of its possessor.
