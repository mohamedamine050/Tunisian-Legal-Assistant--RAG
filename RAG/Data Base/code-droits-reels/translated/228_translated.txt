The creditor is not obligated to return the mortgage.

A formal mortgage is a contract by which the creditor acquires, on a property designated to satisfy his debt, a real right which allows him to take precedence over ordinary creditors and creditors subsequent to him in rank in recovering his right from the price of that property, in whomever's possession it may be.

This is applicable unless the parties agree otherwise, even if divisible.

However, if several independent things are mortgaged, each guaranteeing a part of the debt, the debtor who pays part of the debt has the right to recover the corresponding mortgaged things.
