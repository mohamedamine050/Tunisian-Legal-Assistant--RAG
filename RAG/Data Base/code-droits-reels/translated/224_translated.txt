If the mortgage is challenged,

the official mortgage is a contract by which the creditor acquires, over a property allocated to the satisfaction of his debt, a real right allowing him to take precedence over ordinary creditors and subsequent creditors in the order of priority in the recovery of his right from the price of that property, in whichever hand it may be.

Because of a reason not attributable to the creditor, he could not request an increase in the security unless there is an agreement to the contrary.
