No one may acquire ownership by adverse possession contrary to the instrument by which he obtained possession; therefore, he may not unilaterally alter the structure of his holding for his own benefit.

However, he may acquire ownership by adverse possession if the nature of his holding changes, either by the act of a third party or by his opposition to the owner. In this case, the running of the statute of limitations does not begin until the date of this change.  The statute of limitations is the loss of the right to pursue a claim due to failure to comply with deadlines.
