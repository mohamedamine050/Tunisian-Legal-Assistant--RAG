(Amended by Law No. 46 of 1992, dated May 4, 1992).

The following matters must be registered by way of registration of ownership:

Firstly: All deeds and agreements between living persons, whether gratuitous or for consideration, and all judgments that have acquired the force of res judicata, whether such deeds, agreements, and judgments relate to the creation of a real right, its transfer, declaration, modification, extinction, rendering it inalienable, restricting its free movement, or altering any other condition of its registration.

Secondly: Deeds and judgments ordering the transfer of a right of co-ownership. This provision applies to the subdivision of real estate, including partitioning and division, even if the subject matter is an inheritance.  Heirs or legatees may not legally dispose of a real right included in the inheritance or legacy, as the case may be, before the registration of the transfer of ownership upon death.

Failure to register the matters set forth in the aforementioned paragraphs shall result in the real rights contained therein not being admissible as evidence between the parties concerned themselves, and the unregistered matters shall only give rise to personal obligations.


The following matters must be registered by way of registration of ownership in order to be opposable to third parties:

Firstly: Real estate lease agreements exceeding three years in duration, as well as lease agreements of shorter duration or renewal agreements, if they grant the right to use the property for a period exceeding the end of the third year from the date they were concluded. Lease agreements exceeding three years which have not been registered may be opposable to third parties until the expiry of the three-year period running from the date of registration of the deed or judgment pursuant to which the right to use the property was granted.

Secondly: Deeds and judgments establishing the payment or transfer of a sum exceeding a specified annual rent whose payment date has not yet fallen due.

Thirdly: Deeds and judgments establishing the payment or transfer of a sum exceeding a specified annual installment whose payment date has not yet fallen due.
