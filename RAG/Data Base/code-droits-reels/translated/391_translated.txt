(Amended by Law No. 46 of 1992 dated May 4, 1992).

If an omission or error occurs in the registration of ownership or in the surveys, the interested parties may request its correction.

The Keeper of Real Estate Registry may also, on his own initiative, correct the errors made by him and remedy material errors in the deeds issued by him or by the officials of the Real Estate Registry administration entrusted with this task.

In all cases, the original surveys must be kept as they are, and the correction must be completed with its date.

In the event of refusal by the Keeper of Real Estate Registry, the President of the Real Estate Court, if requested, may authorize the correction as mentioned above. He may also, if necessary, authorize the delivery of the title deed or certificate of its content. (Amended by Law No. 10 of 1995 dated January 23, 1995).
