The owner of the property burdened with an easement may not do anything that would restrict the exercise of the easement or make it more onerous.

If the continued existence of the easement in its current location becomes excessively burdensome to the owner of the burdened property, or prevents him from undertaking beneficial improvements, he may offer the owner of the property benefiting from that right an alternative location, without causing any greater burden than previously existed.  In this case, the beneficiary cannot refuse this offer.
