The new owner declares in this document that he is prepared to pay the debts secured by mortgage and the associated costs up to the price agreed upon by the contracting parties, whether it exceeds or falls short of the sale price or the declared value, without deducting any amount thereof in favor of the seller or any other person.

The new owner benefits from the deadlines granted to the original debtor and respects the deadlines stipulated for the latter, unless the debt instruments stipulate otherwise.

Debts whose due date has not arrived, and of which only a portion is considered in the distribution among creditors, become immediately due to the extent of that portion for the new owner, and in their entirety for the original debtor.
