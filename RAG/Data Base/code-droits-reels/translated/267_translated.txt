If the mortgagor does not have a formal mortgage contract by which the creditor acquires a real right over a property designated for the repayment of his debt, allowing him to take precedence over ordinary creditors and subsequent creditors in the recovery of his right from the price of that property, regardless of its possessor.  Except for a right subject to rescission, then this formal mortgage is a contract by which the creditor acquires a real right over a property designated for the repayment of his debt, allowing him to take precedence over ordinary creditors and subsequent creditors in the recovery of his right from the price of that property, regardless of its possessor. It is extinguished by the rescission of the mortgagor's rights.

However, the mortgagor's voluntary relinquishment of the right or thing subject to a rescindable right does not prejudice the secured creditors.
