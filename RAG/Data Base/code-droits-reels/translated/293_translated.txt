If it becomes apparent that a prior registration of an objection has occurred, the objection is a remedy available to the defaulting party to challenge a decision made in absentia.  However, contrary to the rules governing this objection, the new owner may register their ownership after notifying the objecting party at their chosen address and other registered creditors, as stipulated in the preceding section.

No further registration shall take place before the completion of the purging procedures or the withdrawal of the objection.
