The official mortgage is a contract by which the creditor acquires a real right over a property designated to satisfy his debt.  By virtue of this right, he has precedence over ordinary creditors and those subsequent to him in rank in recovering his right from the proceeds of that property, whomever may possess it.  The real estate mortgage is only subject to the following real rights:

1) Ownership subject to sale and purchase.

2) The right of usufruct for its duration.

3)  Easement (or servitude of right of way).

4) Emphyteusis for its duration.

5) Air rights.
