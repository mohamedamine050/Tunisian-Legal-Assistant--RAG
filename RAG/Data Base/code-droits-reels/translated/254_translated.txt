If the mortgage is an official mortgage, it is a contract by which the creditor acquires a real right over a property designated for the satisfaction of his debt.  By virtue of this right, he may take precedence over ordinary creditors and creditors subsequent to him in rank in recovering his right from the price of that property, in whosever hands it may be.  If the money was for the creditor to use in discharging his debt, he is not required to account to the debtor except for any amount exceeding his debt.
