If the secured creditor authorizes the sale of the mortgaged property as per the preceding article, the mortgage passes to the proceeds of the sale if the debt's due date has not yet arrived.  However, if the debt's due date has arrived, the secured creditor may exercise his priority right on the price agreed upon by the contracting parties, whether it exceeds or falls short of the sale price, while retaining the right to recourse against the debtor for the remaining balance if the debt is not fully satisfied.  A formal mortgage is a contract by which the creditor acquires a real right on an immovable property designated for the satisfaction of his debt; by virtue of this right, he is entitled to priority over ordinary creditors and subsequent creditors in the recovery of his right from the price of that property, regardless of its ownership.
