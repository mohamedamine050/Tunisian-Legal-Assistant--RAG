Whoever possesses a movable thing or a portion of movables is presumed to own it rightfully, and it is incumbent upon anyone claiming otherwise to prove it.  The presumption of ownership does not apply if the possessor knew, or should have known, upon receiving the movable thing, that the transferor lacked the right to dispose of it.
