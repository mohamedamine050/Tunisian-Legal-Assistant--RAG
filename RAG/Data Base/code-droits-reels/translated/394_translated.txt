(Amended successively by Law No. 68 of 1997 dated October 27, 1997 and by Law No. 35 of 2001 dated April 17, 2001).

Anyone requesting registration, cancellation of registration, amendment of registration, or reduction of registration must submit to the registration officer, in exchange for a receipt, the deed in the required number of copies and necessary supporting documents, along with the title deed if previously submitted.

The registration officer must carry out the registration procedures in accordance with the provisions of the Registration and Tax Stamp Code, collect the Land Registry administration fee, and forward the aforementioned documents within a maximum period of seven days from the date of receipt to the regional Land Registry administration having jurisdiction over the land register.

The registration officer must take into account the order in which the documents were submitted to the registration office when forwarding them.

The date of the requested operation is only considered from the date the Land Registry administration receives these documents.

All registration, cancellation, amendment, or reduction operations requested by the state for its benefit in properties and property rights it owns are exempt from the Land Registry administration fee.
