The required process may only be implemented directly if the right to be registered or provisionally recorded is among those rights recognized by this Code and which must be publicized.

Furthermore, the Director of Land Registry must verify that the registration, provisional recording, or cancellation is a recognized mechanism in mortgage law, and that its legal regime differs between registered and unregistered titles.  The request must not conflict with the data entered in the land register, and nothing prevents the concerned party from disposing of the right that has been transferred or created, and the submitted documents permit the implementation of the required process.
