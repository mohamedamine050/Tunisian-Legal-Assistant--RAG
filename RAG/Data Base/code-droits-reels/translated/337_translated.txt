(Amended by Law No. 10 of 1995 dated January 23, 1995).

Any person whose rights have been harmed by a registration or recording resulting from a written court decision resolving a legal issue or fact, which has become final by registration, cannot challenge the property itself. However, in the case of error, such person has the right to pursue a personal action against the beneficiary of the registration for compensation of damages.
