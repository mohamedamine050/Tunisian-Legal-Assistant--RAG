* The designation of the appropriate individual for the position, who meets the qualifications and competencies required to perform the duties.
* The address of the individual in the city where the court is located.

The summons shall be served upon both the accused and the public prosecutor. Failure to serve the summons shall result in the dismissal of the prosecution.

The time between the summons and the appearance before the court shall be twenty days. However, the time for appearance shall be reduced to 48 hours in cases of slander or defamation directed at a candidate for an elective office during the electoral campaign.
