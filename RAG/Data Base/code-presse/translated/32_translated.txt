The deletion of a response from one of the editions of the issue in which it was supposed to be published shall be considered as refusal to publish. The perpetrator shall be punished with the same penalties, regardless of any claim for damages.

A claim is a legal action brought by the complainant before the court against another party, whether an individual or a private institution, in which the complainant demands a right or compensation for a loss caused by the defendant.

The court shall rule within ten days following the date of filing the case or the receipt of the summons in the complaint relating to the refusal to publish. The court may decide that the judgment issued in the authorization to publish – but only in relation to the publication – shall be enforced upon its drafting, regardless of any objection or appeal. In the event of an appeal, the court shall rule on it within ten days following the notification submitted to the court registry.
