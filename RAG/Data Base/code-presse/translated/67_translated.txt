If a written judgment or decision from a court resolves a legal or factual matter and results in a conviction, courts may, in the instances outlined in Articles 43 to 47 of this Code and Article 81 of the Military Judiciary Code, order the seizure of writings, printed materials, posters, drawings, advertisements, films, discs, magnetic tapes, or any other items that are the subject matter of the investigation. The court may also order, in all cases, the confiscation, annulment, or destruction of all copies available for sale, distributed, or publicly displayed.

However, the deletion or destruction may only encompass certain parts of each copy among the seized copies.

Any written judgment or decision from a court resolving a legal or factual matter that imposes punishment for the offense of threatening defamation shall lead to the suspension of the periodical publication that is the subject of the investigation, regardless of the provisions of the Criminal Code concerning the misdemeanor of threatening defamation.

Printing, reproducing, manufacturing, offering for sale, or distributing a publication that has been ordered to be deleted is punishable by a fine ranging from 120 dinars to 1200 dinars.
