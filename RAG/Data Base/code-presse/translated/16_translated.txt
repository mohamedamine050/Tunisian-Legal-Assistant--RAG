Every publication must have a manager, and this manager must be a Tunisian national with actual residence in Tunisia. They must also enjoy their civil and political rights.

If the periodical publication is issued by a legal entity with its own legal personality, special resources, and independent financial assets separate from the financial assets of its members or shareholders, the manager must be chosen, as the case may be, from among the members of the Board of Directors or the management body.

In the event that one natural person owns the majority of the share capital of the entity publishing a periodical publication, that person must be the manager of the publication.
