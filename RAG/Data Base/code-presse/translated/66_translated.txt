No action for defamation or disparagement shall be brought against any statement made in good faith in judicial pleadings, speeches delivered in court, or written submissions made to courts.

However, the judges hearing the case may, in their discretion, order the deletion of any statements containing defamation, disparagement, or insult, and may, if appropriate, impose a fine on the person responsible.

The injured party may, however, bring a civil action for defamation outside of the context of a lawsuit if the courts have preserved their right to do so, and any third party may bring a civil action in all cases.
