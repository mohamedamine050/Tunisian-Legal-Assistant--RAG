The publication of indictments and other documents related to criminal proceedings is prohibited before they are read aloud in an open court session. Anyone who violates this provision shall be punished with a fine ranging from 120 to 1200 Dinars.

The same penalty applies to anyone who publishes, through any means of transmission whatsoever, particularly by photographic reproduction, engraved plates, drawings, pictures of persons, or films, all or part of the circumstances surrounding any of the crimes or misdemeanors defined in Chapters 201 to 240 of the Penal Code. 

However, there is no crime if the publication is made pursuant to a written request from the judge in charge of the investigation. The aforementioned request shall be added to the judicial investigation file.
