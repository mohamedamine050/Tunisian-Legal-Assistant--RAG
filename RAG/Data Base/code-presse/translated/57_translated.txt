Libel may be proven by the usual means if it relates only to the plan, provided that it is attributed to official bodies or to the land, sea, or air forces, or to public administrations, or to all persons concerned in Section 52 of this Code.

Libel may also be proven if it relates only to the plan and is directed against managers or administrators of any industrial, commercial or financial institution that openly relies on savings or loans.

Libel may not be proven in the following cases:

(a) If the matter attributed relates to the person's private life.

(b) If the matter attributed relates to events that have occurred more than ten years ago.

(c) If the matter attributed relates to a crime that has been extinguished by amnesty, prescription, or a sentence that has been the subject of restitution of rights.

In the cases provided for in the first and second paragraphs of this Section, a counter-argument may be presented. If libel is proven, the prosecution is halted.

If the matter attributed is subject to criminal prosecution at the request of the Public Prosecutor or on complaint by the suspect, the proceedings for prosecution and trial for the offense of libel are suspended pending the completion of the necessary investigation.
