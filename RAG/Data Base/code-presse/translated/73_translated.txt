The Minister of the Interior, after consulting the Secretary of State for Information under the Prime Minister, and notwithstanding the penalties provided for in the current legislation, may issue a permit to seize any issue of a periodical whose publication is likely to disturb public order. Where appropriate, damages may be claimed in accordance with the provisions of the applicable laws. 

In the event of proceedings pursuant to Articles 43, 44 and 46 to 49 of this Code, the court hearing the matter, after hearing the parties concerned and within eight days, may decide, by way of a summary procedure, to suspend the publication of the periodical in question for a period exceeding three months in the case of daily periodicals and for a period not exceeding six months for other periodicals.

The decision of the court shall be enforceable immediately and subject to appeal. The Court of Appeal shall rule on the appeal within ten days from the date of the filing of the request with the court.

The suspended periodical shall cease publication and shall be considered to continue to be suspended even if it is published under a title other than its original title, if the factual circumstances, particularly the involvement of all or some of the persons working for the suspended periodical, or the distinctive characteristics of that periodical, show that it is in fact a continuation of the suspended periodical.

This suspension shall not affect employment contracts that existed between the publisher, who shall remain liable for all contractual or legal obligations arising from the said contracts.

Any person who continues to publish the periodical shall be punished by imprisonment for a term of sixteen days to six months and a fine of sixty (60) to six hundred (600) dinars.
