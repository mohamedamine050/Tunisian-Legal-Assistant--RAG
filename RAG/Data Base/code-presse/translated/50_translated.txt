Any claim or attribution made publicly that is likely to harm the honor or reputation of an individual or official entity shall be considered defamation.

The public declaration of such a claim or attribution, whether directly or through transmission, shall be punishable, even if it is presented in the form of a possibility or if it is intended for an individual or official entity that is not explicitly named, provided that the content of the statements contained in the speeches, calls, threats, writings, publications, notices, drawings, advertisements, or other materials in question makes it easy to identify the intended target.
