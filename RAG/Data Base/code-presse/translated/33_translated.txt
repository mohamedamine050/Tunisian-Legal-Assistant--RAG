However, during the electoral period, the three-day period stipulated in Article 27 for inclusion is reduced to twenty-four hours in respect of daily newspapers, and the reply must be delivered at least six hours before the printing of the newspaper in which it is intended to be published. Once the electoral period commences, the newspaper manager is obligated to notify the Public Prosecutorâ€™s Office of the time he intends to begin printing his newspaper during the aforementioned period, failing which he will be subject to the penalties stipulated in Article 27.

The deadline for the summons before the Court of First Instance to refrain from inclusion is reduced to twenty-four hours, and the summons may be served from one hour to the next with permission issued by the President of the Court of First Instance. The judgment ordering inclusion - and only concerning inclusion - is enforceable upon the drafting of the judgment, regardless of any objection or appeal.  In the event that the ordered inclusion does not occur within twenty-four hours of the date of the judgment, the newspaper manager shall be subject to a prison sentence of sixteen days to three months and a fine of two hundred to two thousand four hundred dinars, or either of these penalties alone.
