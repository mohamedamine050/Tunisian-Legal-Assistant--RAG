If the directors of publications or publishers are subject to prosecution, the authors shall be prosecuted as participants.

Similarly, prosecutions may be conducted in the same capacity and in all forms against all persons who may be subject to Article 32 of the Criminal Code. However, this Article shall not apply to the printer in relation to printing works.

The printer may, however, be prosecuted as a participant if a 
**judgment** 
by the court finding the director of publication not liable 
**criminally** 
is issued. In such a case, prosecution must be initiated within three months of the date of the crime, and no later than three months from the date on which the non-liability of the director of publication is established.
