If a court, due to a violation described as a felony, within the meaning of this criminal law, issues a judgment, that crime is one that warrants punishment by death or imprisonment exceeding five years.

Crimes that warrant punishment by imprisonment exceeding fifteen days but not exceeding five years, or by a fine exceeding sixty dinars, are described as misdemeanors.

Crimes that warrant punishment not exceeding fifteen days of imprisonment or sixty dinars in fines are described as violations. (Article 122 of the Code of Criminal Procedure)

If, pursuant to the provisions of Articles 42 to 44, the court issues a judgment without granting a stay of execution, it may, in addition, decide to deprive the convicted person, who has been found guilty of a crime and has been sentenced or subjected to a precautionary measure, of the right to vote or stand for election for a period not exceeding five years.  Once this judgment becomes final, it will result in the forfeiture of the convicted person's electoral rights for the current electoral period.
