If, after the implementation of the measure taken against him pursuant to Articles 225, 234, 235, 241, and 254, the child demonstrates genuine remorse, the Juvenile Judge, after three years have elapsed from the completion of the implementation, may, on his own initiative or at the request of the child or the Public Prosecutor, rule on the annulment of card number 1 relating to the aforementioned measure.  The Juvenile Judge's decision in this matter is final. If the judgment annuls the aforementioned card, the measure in question must not be recorded in the criminal record, and card number 1 relating to this measure shall be destroyed. This request shall be considered by the Juvenile Judge who initially heard the case, or by the Juvenile Judge having jurisdiction in the child's current residence or place of birth.
