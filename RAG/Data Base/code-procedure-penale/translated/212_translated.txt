The appeal request is submitted to the registry of the court that issued the judgment, either orally with immediate written recording, or by written notification. The appellant must sign it; if the appellant refuses to sign or is unable to do so, this must be stated. If the appellant is detained, the chief prison warden shall receive the request and forward it without delay to the court registry.
