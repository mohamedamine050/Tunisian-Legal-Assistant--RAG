The court responsible for the reconsideration request shall, in an open hearing, first consider the admissibility of the request in terms of form.  Then, it shall set another hearing for the merits of the case without requiring the refiling of the claim.  It may rule on the admissibility and merits of the appeal in a single judgment if the parties have completed their submissions on the merits.
