The Investigating Judge, appointed by the judiciary or the Public Prosecution to investigate the case, shall, with the assistance of his clerk, hear witnesses and interrogate the suspect.  Suspicion, in this context, means the presumption of committing a crime before the charges are filed.  He shall conduct on-site inspections, search houses, and seize items relevant to uncovering the truth. He shall order the carrying out of tests and complete all actions leading to the revelation of evidence proving or refuting the charge. The Investigating Judge, appointed by the judiciary or the Public Prosecution to investigate the case, shall sign, along with his clerk and the court reporter, each page of his minutes. Writing between the lines is not permitted.  Erasures and deletions shall be authenticated and signed by the Investigating Judge, appointed by the judiciary or the Public Prosecution to investigate the case, his clerk, and the court reporter. Erasures and deletions that have not been authenticated are considered null and void, as is writing between the lines.
