If imprisonment is concluded for any reason, it may not be carried out again, neither for the same debt nor for prior penalties before its execution, unless these penalties, due to the sum of their amounts, result in imprisonment for a longer period than that already served. In this case, the previously served imprisonment period must be deducted from the new imprisonment period.
