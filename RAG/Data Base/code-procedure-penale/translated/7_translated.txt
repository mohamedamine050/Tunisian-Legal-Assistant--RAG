The Claim

[1] A claim is a request by one party for another to fulfill their right in the presence of a judge; the requester is called the claimant and the party requested to fulfill the right is called the defendant. [2] A claim is the right of any party with a claim to submit it to the court for a judgment on its subject matter.  For the opposing party, it is the right to present defenses or arguments aimed at refuting that claim.


Civil

The material aspect of civilization, such as infrastructure, means of communication, and entertainment, as opposed to the intellectual, spiritual, and ethical aspects of civilization.  Every person who has personally suffered harm directly resulting from a crime has the right to claim compensation. This can be done concurrently with a public claim or individually before the civil court. In the latter case, consideration is stayed until a final judgment is rendered in the public claim. The party who has previously filed a claim with the civil court may not file it with the criminal court unless the latter court is authorized to do so by the Public Prosecutor's Office before the civil court renders its initial judgment.


Public Prosecutor's Office

The entity responsible for defending the interests of society and enforcing the law before the courts.
