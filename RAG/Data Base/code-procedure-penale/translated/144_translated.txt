The court shall, of itself, hear anyone whose testimony it deems useful.  The Public Prosecutor, responsible for defending the interests of society and applying the law before the judicial courts, and the party with standing and the suspect, may request the hearing of their witnesses. They are required to specify the identity of those witnesses and state the subject of their testimony. The court shall assess the validity of this request and, in the event of refusal, shall issue a reasoned judgment.
