The deliberation shall be confidential and shall leave no written record.  Only the judges who attended the hearing may participate. When a majority is reached, a legal document, submitted by one of the litigants personally or through a lawyer to clarify their claims, defend their rights, or respond to the opponent's allegations in the judgment and its supporting documents, shall be drawn up and signed by the judges who participated in the deliberation. This document does not acquire its final form until it is declared in an open session attended by all the judges who signed it. If a judge is prevented from attending the declaration session of the judgment after the deliberation and signing of the document due to a serious health impediment, the judgment shall be declared in the presence of the remaining judges. However, if the absent judge did not sign the document, or if the reason for his absence relates to the termination of his judicial capacity, the deliberation must be dissolved and the case must be reheard.
