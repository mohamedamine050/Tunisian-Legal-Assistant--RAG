The consideration of extradition requests is a characteristic of the prosecution department at the Court of Appeal in Tunis.  This court is a place where litigation takes place between specialists; it is a civil court under the judicial authority, which must have its independence within the three branches of government. The foreign national must appear before it within a maximum of fifteen days from the date of notification of the arrest warrant. Then, he shall be interrogated, and a record of this interrogation shall be drawn up. The representative of the Public Prosecution, the body responsible for defending the society's interest and applying the law before the courts, and the person concerned shall be heard. The latter may be assisted by a lawyer, and he may be granted provisional release at any stage of the proceedings, in accordance with the provisions of this law.
