If the suspect (suspect meaning suspicion of committing a crime before the charge is filed) is absent, or in any of the circumstances set forth in Article 85, the Investigating Judge may issue an arrest warrant against him. This warrant shall be dated, signed, and sealed, and shall identify the suspect (suspect meaning suspicion of committing a crime before the charge is filed)  with complete identification, stating the subject of the charge and the applicable legal provisions.  It shall also authorize any member of the public security forces to arrest and bring him before the Investigating Judge (the person assigned by the judiciary or the public prosecution to investigate the case). If the suspect (suspect meaning suspicion of committing a crime before the charge is filed) cannot be found, the arrest warrant shall be presented to the head of his residence or to the sheikh of his place of residence, who shall acknowledge receipt. If, for the execution of the arrest warrant, a judicial police officer must detain the suspect (suspect meaning suspicion of committing a crime before the charge is filed), he must immediately present him to the Investigating Judge, and in any case, within a maximum period not exceeding forty-eight hours. In this case, the judicial police officer may not undertake any preliminary investigation work other than drawing up a report including the identification of the person against whom the arrest warrant was issued.  He must comply with the provisions of Article 13 bis of this Code regarding medical examination and inclusion of identification in the medical record, and with the provisions of Article 13, fourthly, concerning the right to visit his lawyer.
