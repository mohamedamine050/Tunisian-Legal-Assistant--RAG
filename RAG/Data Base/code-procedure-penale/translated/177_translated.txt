The appellant may bear the costs of the proceedings. The judgment, a written decision of the court resolving a legal or factual matter, acquitted him.  The judgment is not subject to any form of appeal.  An action taken during the trial may be undertaken by the defense, or one of the parties to the suit, often the defendant, to object to the judgment.
