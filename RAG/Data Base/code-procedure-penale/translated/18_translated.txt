Optional complaints and reports may be lodged orally with a judicial officer, who must include them in a report signed by him and the complainant or informant. If the latter refuses to sign or is unable to do so, this must be stated in the report.  Complaints may also be submitted in writing; in this case, they must be signed by the complainants, their agents, or their legal representatives.  The complaints must include the acts that constitute the basis for prosecution, as well as the means of proof.
