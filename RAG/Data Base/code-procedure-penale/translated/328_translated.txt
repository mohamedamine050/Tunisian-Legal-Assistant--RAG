The Examining Chamber shall decide whether all or some of the documents, securities, funds, and other seized items should be surrendered to the requesting State. This surrender may be effected even if the surrender of the requested person is impossible due to their escape or death. The Examining Chamber shall authorize the return of the aforementioned documents and other items that are unrelated to the offense attributed to the foreign national.  It shall also decide, as necessary, on the claims of third parties holding such items and other persons entitled to them. The decisions provided for in this chapter are not subject to any form of appeal.
