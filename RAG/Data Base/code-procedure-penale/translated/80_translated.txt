After questioning the suspect, the Investigating Judge may issue a detention order.  "Suspect" refers to the suspicion of committing a crime before the charges are filed.

The detention order is prepared, dated, signed, and stamped by the Investigating Judge. It clearly states the name and title of the Investigating Judge, the name of the suspect, the suspect's approximate age, profession, place of birth, residence, and the subject of the accusation, specifying the applicable legal provision.  The order includes the Judge's instruction to the chief prison warden to accept and detain the accused in prison after obtaining the opinion of the Public Prosecutor, if the act warrants imprisonment or a harsher penalty.

If the Investigating Judge's decision is contrary to the Public Prosecutor's request, the latter may appeal the decision to the Court of Appeal within four days of being notified of the decision, which must be communicated to him immediately.  "Investigating Judge" refers to the person entrusted by the judiciary or the Public Prosecutor's Office to investigate the case. "Public Prosecutor" refers to a person acting on behalf of another.
