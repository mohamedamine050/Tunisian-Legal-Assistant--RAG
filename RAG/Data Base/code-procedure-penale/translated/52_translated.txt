The case is assigned to the Investigating Judge whose jurisdiction covers the place where the crime was committed, or the place where the suspect resides.  Suspicion, in this context, means the presumption of a crime having been committed before the charges are filed, or the place of his last residence, or the place where he was found. If the crime falls under the purview of a court—a court being a place where litigation between parties takes place, and is a civil institution falling under the judicial authority which must have its independence within the three branches of government—of exceptional nature, then the Investigating Judge, the person appointed by the judiciary or the Public Prosecutor's Office to investigate the case, carries out the investigative procedures. Upon completion, he decides whether to relinquish the case.
