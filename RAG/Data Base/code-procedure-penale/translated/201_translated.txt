The defendant shall attend the public hearing in person, and may be represented by a lawyer or another person by means of a special power of attorney. However, if the judge deems the defendant's personal presence necessary, he may order his recall for a hearing, the date of which he shall specify. If, within the specified time limit, the defendant who has been recalled fails to appear, as mentioned, the judge shall not await his presence and shall issue a judgment that shall be considered as rendered in his presence.
