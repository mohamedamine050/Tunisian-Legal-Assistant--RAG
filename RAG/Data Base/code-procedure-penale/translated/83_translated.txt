(Amended by Law No. 70 of 1987 dated 26 November 1987). - Non-compliance with legal forms in drafting judicial cards does not result in their nullity, but this shall entail disciplinary sanctions and a fine where appropriate.  Any dispute concerning the subject matter of the card or the extent to which it affects individual liberty falls solely within the jurisdiction of the judicial courts.
