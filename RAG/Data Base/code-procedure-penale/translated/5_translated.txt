The claim is extinguished by the lapse of time under the following conditions: ten full years if arising from a felony; three full years if arising from a misdemeanor; and one full year if arising from an infraction.

A felony is a serious crime punishable under the law by severe penalties such as imprisonment.  Misdemeanors are crimes punishable by imprisonment exceeding fifteen days but not exceeding five years, or by a fine exceeding sixty dinars. Infractions are crimes punishable by imprisonment not exceeding fifteen days or a fine not exceeding sixty dinars.  This time period begins from the day the crime was committed, provided that no investigation or pursuit took place during that period.  The statute of limitations is suspended by any legal or material impediment preventing the prosecution of the claim. [1] A claim is a request by one party for their right from another in the presence of a judge; the requester is called the plaintiff, and the party against whom the claim is made is called the defendant. [2] A claim is the right of anyone with a demand to bring it before the court for judgment on its merits.  It is, with respect to the opposing party, the right to present grounds of defense or arguments aimed at refuting that claim.

The general statute of limitations applies, except for exceptions provided by law, and except for impediments resulting from the will of the accused.  In the case specified in Article 77, the accused not held in prison benefits from the running of the statute of limitations during a period of suspension of investigation due to insanity.  The statute of limitations does not apply to the crime of torture.
