If the agent of the Republic, the suspect, the civilly liable party, or the party asserting a personal right, contends that the case should be removed from the purview of the Investigating Judge, the Investigating Judge shall rule on this matter.  The decision rendered in rejecting this request may be appealed to the Court of Appeal (Dائرة الاتهام) within four days from the date of notification for the Agent of the Republic, and from the date of information for all others.  The appeal does not prevent the continuation of the investigation.
