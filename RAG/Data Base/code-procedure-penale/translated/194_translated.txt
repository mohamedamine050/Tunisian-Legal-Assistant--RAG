Copies of the following may be provided to the parties at their own expense: 1) a copy of the complaint or denunciation, or of the final decisions issued by the Investigating Judge, the Public Prosecutor's Office, or the Court of First Instance;  upon their request. 2) Copies of the remaining case files, after obtaining authorization from the Attorney General. If the request is from a non-party, authorization from the Attorney General is required regardless of the document requested. If the documents belong to a file deposited with the Court of Appeal registry, then the authorization must be issued by the Public Prosecutor. Refusal to grant authorization must be reasoned and notified administratively; it can only be challenged before the immediate superior of the refusing official.  Criminal case files may be referred to the courts for review if a decision to that effect is issued. They may also be referred to the Ministry of Justice for the same purpose.  The court clerk will then prepare a list of the documents accompanying the transferred files.
