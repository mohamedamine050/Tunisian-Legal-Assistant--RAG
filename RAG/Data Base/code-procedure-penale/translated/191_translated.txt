Judicial costs shall be borne by the defendant.  The defendant is an accused person against whom a judgment has been rendered. A judgment is a written decision of the court resolving a legal issue or a matter of fact. The judgment determined his responsibility for a crime and imposed a penalty or precautionary measure upon him. If the judgment is rendered against multiple defendants for a single crime or for related crimes, the costs shall be borne by them jointly and severally. If the costs cannot be specified in the judgment, the court clerk is authorized to issue an enforcement writ after their determination by the presiding judge, without the need for new procedures.
