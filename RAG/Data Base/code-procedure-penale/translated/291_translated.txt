The amendment takes place between the judges if a crime occurs and is handled by two courts, considering it falls under the jurisdiction of each, or if both courts decide it falls outside their jurisdiction, or if a court decides on its lack of competence to consider a case referred to it by the investigating judge.  The investigating judge is the person entrusted by the judiciary or the Public Prosecution to investigate the case. A dispute arises from what has been mentioned; a dispute being the existence of a legal conflict between two parties.  A court, a place where litigation takes place between the parties, is a civil entity subordinate to the judicial authority, which must have its independence within the three branches of government.  The conflict over jurisdiction hindered the course of justice due to the contradictory decisions issued in the same case, undermining the authority of the judiciary.
