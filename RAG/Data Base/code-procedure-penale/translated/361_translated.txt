Court clerks must record in a special register the names, titles, professions, ages, and residences of all persons convicted of felonies or misdemeanors, along with a summary of the case and the judgment rendered.  They must then, within a maximum period of eight days each week, send a copy of these registers to the authority responsible for maintaining the criminal record. Court clerks must also maintain a special alphabetical register, not accessible to the public, listing all decisions relating to children, including decisions taken in urgent matters concerning supervised liberty and in review cases concerning the child's status, guardianship, or handover to a guardian.  They must then, within the same timeframe, send copies of judgments rendered against children over the age of thirteen to the aforementioned authority.
