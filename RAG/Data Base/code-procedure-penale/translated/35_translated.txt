The Investigating Judge within his jurisdiction may, in cases of flagrant offenses, personally carry out all the acts authorized to Public Prosecutors by law, in addition to his own specific duties. He must immediately inform the Public Prosecutor.  Specifically, he may hear witnesses without prior summons and arrest, upon oral authorization, any suspect present. He himself orders the execution of his decisions.  Afterward, he sends his reports to the Public Prosecutor, who decides on them as he sees fit.
