An application for reconsideration shall only be accepted to rectify a material error that prejudiced a party.  A judgment is a written court decision resolving a legal or factual issue.

Felony: A felony is a serious crime punishable under the law and subject to severe penalties such as imprisonment.

or

Misdemeanor:  Misdemeanors are crimes punishable by imprisonment exceeding fifteen days but not exceeding five years, or by a fine exceeding sixty dinars.

An application for reconsideration may be submitted in the following circumstances, regardless of the court that rendered the judgment and the penalty imposed:

First: If, after judgment for murder, documents or evidence are presented from which sufficient indications are deduced that the alleged victim was alive.

Second: If a judgment was rendered against a person for an act, and another judgment was subsequently rendered against another person for the same act, and there is an irreconcilable contradiction between the two judgments proving the innocence of one of the convicted parties.

Third: If a judgment was rendered against a person, and after the judgment, one of the witnesses who testified against him was prosecuted for perjury.  This convicted person, a defendant against whom a judgment determining his responsibility for a crime and imposing a penalty or precautionary measure was rendered, may not be heard in the new trial.

Fourth: If facts occur or appear after the judgment, or documents are presented that were not known at the time of the trial, and these facts or documents would prove the innocence of the convicted person, or show that the crime committed is less serious than the crime for which he was tried.
