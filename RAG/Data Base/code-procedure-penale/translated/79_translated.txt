The Investigating Judge, the person entrusted by the judiciary or the Public Prosecutor's Office to investigate the case, shall, upon the apprehension of a suspect—suspect meaning a person suspected of committing a crime before the charges are filed—by virtue of a summons—summons being the order issued to law enforcement officers to bring a specific person for questioning or to hear his statement—interrogate him within a period not exceeding three days from the date of his detention in prison. Upon expiry of this period, the chief prison warden shall present the suspect—suspect meaning a person suspected of committing a crime before the charges are filed—to the Public Prosecutor who shall request the Investigating Judge—the person entrusted by the judiciary or the Public Prosecutor's Office to investigate the case—to immediately interrogate him.  If the Investigating Judge—the person entrusted by the judiciary or the Public Prosecutor's Office to investigate the case—refuses to conduct the interrogation or if it proves impossible for him to do so, the President of the Court or a judge designated by him shall conduct the interrogation. If this interrogation does not take place, the Public Prosecutor shall order the immediate release of the suspect.
