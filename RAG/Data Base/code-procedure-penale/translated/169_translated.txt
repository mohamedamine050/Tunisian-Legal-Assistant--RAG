If it appears that the crime falls under the jurisdiction of another court, a court which is a place where litigation takes place between specialists, and is a civil court that falls under the judicial authority which must have its independence within the three branches of government, the court shall issue a ruling dismissing the case and shall forward the file to the Public Prosecutor; the Public Prosecutor being the body responsible for defending the interests of society and applying the law before the judicial courts.  The Public Prosecutor may, if necessary, issue a detention order.  The detention order is prepared, dated, signed, and stamped by the investigating judge.  It shall clearly state the name and title of the investigating judge, the name, approximate age, profession, place of birth, and residence of the suspect, the subject of the charge with a statement of the applicable legal text. It shall include the order issued by the judge to the chief prison warden to accept and detain the accused.  The Public Prosecutor may also issue a decision against the suspect or authorize his temporary release with or without bail.
