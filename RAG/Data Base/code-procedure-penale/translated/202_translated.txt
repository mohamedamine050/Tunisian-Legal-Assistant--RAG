The judge may keep the suspect under his order by virtue of a detention order.  The detention order is issued, dated, signed, and sealed by the investigating judge. It clearly states the name and title of the judge, the suspect's name, approximate age, profession, place of birth, residence, and the subject of the charge, specifying the applicable legal text.  The order includes the judge's instruction to the chief prison warden to accept and detain the accused. This is permissible if the suspect is intoxicated, unable to identify himself, has no fixed address, or if his release is feared to cause disruption. In no case may the suspect be kept in custody for more than eight days.
