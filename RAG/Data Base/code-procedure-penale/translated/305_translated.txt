A Tunisian citizen may be prosecuted by Tunisian courts if they commit, outside Tunisian territory, a felony or a misdemeanor.  A felony is a serious crime punishable under the law, subject to severe penalties such as imprisonment.  A misdemeanor is defined as a crime punishable by imprisonment exceeding fifteen days but not exceeding five years, or by a fine exceeding sixty dinars.  A Tunisian citizen may be punished under Tunisian law unless it is established that the country where the crime was committed does not punish it, or the accused proves that the matter was definitively judged abroad, and in the event of a sentence being handed down, that the sentence has been served, that the punishment has lapsed due to the passage of time, or that it has been pardoned. The provisions of the preceding paragraph apply to an individual who only acquired Tunisian citizenship after the date of commission of the attributed acts. (The third paragraph was repealed by Article 103 of Law No. 75 of 2003, dated December 10, 2003, concerning support for international efforts to combat terrorism and prevent money laundering).
