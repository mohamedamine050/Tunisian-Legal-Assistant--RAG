The decision issued by the Indictment Chamber ordering the referral of the accused to the Criminal Court or to the District Judge is not subject to any form of appeal before the Court of Cassation, except if the aforementioned Chamber acts of its own motion or at the request of the parties in a matter relating to jurisdiction, or if its decision contains final provisions which the court to which the case is referred has no right to amend.  The Court of Cassation is the highest court in the judicial hierarchy; its justification lies in the principle of cassation to oversee the proper application of laws by the courts of first instance.
