If the punishment is not executed, the punishment—a sanction and remedy imposed in the name of society upon a person criminally responsible for a crime committed based on a judicial ruling—its execution shall be legally stayed from the date the request is referred by the Minister of Justice to the Public Prosecutor's Office, the body responsible for defending the interests of society and applying the law before the courts.  And if the convicted person, against whom a judgment—a written decision of the court resolving a legal or factual issue—has been rendered, determining his responsibility for a crime, and imposing a penalty or precautionary measure, is in detention, the execution may be stayed with the authorization of the Minister of Justice until the court rules on the request. Subsequently, and if necessary, pursuant to the decision issued by the court regarding the acceptance of the request.
