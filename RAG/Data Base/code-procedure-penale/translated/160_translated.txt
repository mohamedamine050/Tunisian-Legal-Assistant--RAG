The individuals referred to in Article 63 may be heard at the hearing for guidance purposes only, without taking an oath.  The oath, administered by one party or litigant to another to resolve the dispute between them, is permissible only if the party lacks evidence permitted by law to prove their claim, relying on the conscience, integrity, and religious belief of the other party. This is unless the Public Prosecutor, the body responsible for defending the interests of society and applying the law before the judicial courts, or the accused objects.
