The Primary Court undertakes the following:

Firstly: By direct referral from the Public Prosecutor, if it appears to him unnecessary to refer the case for investigation, or from public administrations and financial branches in cases where the law authorizes them to initiate public action directly, or from the injured party when the Public Prosecutorâ€™s representative refrains from pursuing the case on his own initiative.  The party initiating proceedings in this case must summon the other parties.

Secondly: By referral from the Investigating Judge for investigation into the case, or from another court.

In this case, the Public Prosecutor authorizes the bringing of the suspect and the summoning of those exercising civil action and those civilly liable to the nearest possible hearing.

Thirdly: By referral of the suspect to the court by the Public Prosecutor after a simple interrogation in the case of a crime caught in the act. If there is no hearing that day, the Public Prosecutor may authorize the placement of the suspect in detention by virtue of a detention order.  He is required in this instance to bring him to the nearest possible hearing.

If the case is not ready for judgment, the court shall adjourn it for further investigation to the next hearing and shall confirm the detention order; or, if necessary, release the suspect with or without bail. The court also has the right to drop the case, and the Public Prosecutor may take whatever action he deems appropriate in this regard.
