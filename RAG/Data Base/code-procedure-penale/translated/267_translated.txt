The Court of Cassation is considered the highest court in the judicial hierarchy.  This is justified by the principle of review to oversee the proper application of laws by the courts of first instance.

It holds its sessions and issues its decisions in the deliberation room.  Lawyers may be permitted to attend and plead at the session if they request this in writing. They may only plead on points raised in their written appeals. The court issues its decision after deliberation.  The draft decision is signed by all the judges who issued it.
