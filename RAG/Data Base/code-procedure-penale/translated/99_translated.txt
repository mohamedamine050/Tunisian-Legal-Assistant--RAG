The Investigating Judge may authorize the seizure of all correspondence and other dispatched items if he deems it useful for uncovering the truth.  The Public Prosecutor, even outside the context of a flagrant offense or misdemeanor, may issue an order to search for and seize correspondence addressed to or emanating from a suspect.  Suspicion, in this context, refers to the presumption of committing a crime before the charge is filed. He must not examine them unless there is an imminent danger.
