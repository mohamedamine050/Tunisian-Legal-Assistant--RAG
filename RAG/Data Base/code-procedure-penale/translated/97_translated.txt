The Investigating Judge

The Investigating Judge, a person delegated by the judiciary or the Public Prosecution to investigate a case, shall search for and seize any documents or objects that may aid in uncovering the truth.  A list of the seized items shall be drawn up in a report.

Suspicion, in this context, refers to the presumption of the commission of a crime before charges are filed.

A report, being a form of information delivery, is drafted in a near-final form for transmission to the recipient. The report shall be drawn up in the event of seizure.  Seized objects shall, depending on the circumstances, be placed in a sealed container or file, or a document indicating the date of seizure and case number shall be affixed to them.  Except in cases of felonies or misdemeanors committed in flagrante delicto, judicial officers shall not have the same powers as the Investigating Judge to perform the aforementioned actions, except in cases of imminent danger.
