The summons shall be served on the defendant himself, his agent, his servant, or on any person residing with him, provided that such person is legally competent. If the bailiff finds none of these persons, or if those found refuse to accept service, the summons shall be served on the head of the household, the village elder, the police station chief, or the National Guard commander within whose jurisdiction the defendant resides.
