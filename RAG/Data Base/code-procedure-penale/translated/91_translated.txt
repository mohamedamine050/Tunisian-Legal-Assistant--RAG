If the suspect,  where "suspect" refers to the suspicion of committing a crime before the charge is filed, fails to attend all investigative proceedings and the execution of the judgment against him, and his absence is without a legally acceptable excuse, then the first part of the guarantee shall become the property of the State. However, if the case is dismissed  (dismissal meaning the proceedings are stayed by order of the Public Prosecutor) or a judgment of acquittal is issued, the decision or judgment may stipulate the return of the guarantee money to the suspect or to a third party.  In the event of a judgment against the suspect, the second part of the retained guarantee shall be allocated to cover costs and fines, according to the order set out in the previous article; any surplus shall be returned.
