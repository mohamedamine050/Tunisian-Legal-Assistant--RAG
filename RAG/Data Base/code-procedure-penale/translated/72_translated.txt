The Investigating Judge, the person entrusted by the judiciary or the Public Prosecutor's Office to investigate the case, begins by questioning those suspected of a crime.  Suspicion, in this context, means the presumption of committing a crime before the charges are filed.  They are questioned individually, then confronted with each other or with witnesses, as necessary. The questions, answers, and any incidents arising from the interrogation are recorded in a report drawn up immediately. This report is read to the suspect. Suspicion, in this context, means the presumption of committing a crime before the charges are filed. Then it is signed by the Investigating Judge, the person entrusted by the judiciary or the Public Prosecutor's Office to investigate the case, the clerk, the person questioned, and, if necessary, the lawyer and the translator. Each page must be numbered and signed. If the suspect refuses to sign or is unable to do so, this is noted with a statement of the reason. A suspect may not be interrogated without the presence of their lawyer, unless they explicitly waive this right or the lawyer fails to appear despite being summoned at least twenty-four hours before the interrogation. The lawyer may examine the investigation proceedings one day before each interrogation. They have no right to speak unless the judge permits it; if permission is refused, this is noted in the report, as are the lawyer's statements. The judge may determine whether it is appropriate to conduct any supplementary procedures requested for the purpose of uncovering the truth.
