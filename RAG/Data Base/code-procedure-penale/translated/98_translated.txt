If the seized property is of a nature that risks deterioration or if its preservation entails significant expenses, the Investigating Judge, after obtaining the opinion of the Public Prosecutor and informing the party whose property has been seized, may authorize its sale by public auction as soon as the requirements of the investigation permit.  Any party proving entitlement to the seized property may claim the proceeds within the time limit stipulated in Article 100.
