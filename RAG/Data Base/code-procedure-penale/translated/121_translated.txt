If the Investigating Judge, the person entrusted by the judiciary or the Public Prosecutor's Office to investigate the case, or the Indictment Chamber decides that there are no grounds to prosecute an accused person charged with a criminal offense, then he cannot be prosecuted again for the same act unless new evidence emerges.  New evidence includes witness statements, documents, and reports that could not be presented to the Investigating Judge, or the Indictment Chamber, and which are capable of either strengthening the evidence previously deemed insufficient or introducing new developments in the acts that help to uncover the truth.  A request for appeal is a legal procedure that allows the chosen party to request a review of the judgment issued by the previous court.  The request for a further investigation due to the emergence of new evidence is a characteristic feature that belongs exclusively to the Public Prosecutor or Attorney General.
