The appeal request shall be submitted in writing or orally to the Investigating Judge. If the appellant is detained, the Chief Prison Warden shall receive the appeal request and immediately forward it to the Investigating Judge.  The consideration of the appeal request is within the purview of the Indictment Chamber.  An appeal is a legal procedure that allows the chosen party to request a review of the judgment issued by the previous court.  The suspect in detention shall remain in prison until the appeal is decided, and in all cases until the appeal period expires, unless the Public Prosecutor authorizes immediate release. The aforementioned Chamber shall consider the subject matter of the appeal, and its decision in this regard shall be immediately enforced.
