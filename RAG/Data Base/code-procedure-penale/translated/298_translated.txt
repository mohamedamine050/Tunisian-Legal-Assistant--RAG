The act of disparagement is not admissible.  Disparagement is conduct that incites or instigates hatred, disgust, contempt, or severe mockery on account of a person's race or religion.  The judge is not subject to any form of appeal from the opposing party who, knowing the reason for the disparagement—conduct that incites or instigates hatred, disgust, contempt, or severe mockery on account of a person's race or religion—proceeded to undertake procedural actions or submit observations in the case without engaging in disparagement.
