The investigating judge or judicial police officer must be accompanied by a trustworthy woman when conducting a search of residential premises, if necessary.  If the suspect's presence is impossible or unnecessary at the time of the search, the investigating judge—the person entrusted by the judiciary or the public prosecution to investigate the case—shall have two witnesses present at the procedure. If residents of the premises are unavailable, the witnesses shall be chosen from the neighbourhood.  Their signatures are required on the report.
