(Amended by Law No. 90 of 1999 dated August 2, 1999). â€“ The term of imprisonment is reduced by half, and this term, provided it does not exceed one year (1), may be replaced by work for the public good at the request of the convicted person.

The convicted person is a defendant against whom a judgment has been rendered determining his responsibility for a crime, and imposing a penalty or precautionary measure.  This applies in the following cases: 1) If the convicted person submits a certificate of poverty issued by the governor of the region of his habitual residence attesting to his inability to pay; 2) If the convicted person reaches the age of sixty.  These two reasons cannot be combined.
