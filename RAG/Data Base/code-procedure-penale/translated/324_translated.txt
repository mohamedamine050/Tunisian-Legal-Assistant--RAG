If the opinion of the Prosecution Department is to accept the extradition request, the Government may grant or refuse extradition. If it is decided to grant extradition, the Secretary of State for Justice shall submit to the President of the Republic an order to that effect. If the requesting Stateâ€™s agents fail to receive the person whose extradition is sought within one month of notification of the extradition order, that person shall be released, and their extradition cannot thereafter be sought on the same grounds.
