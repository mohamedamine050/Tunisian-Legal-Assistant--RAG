The Investigating Judge may, accompanied by his clerk, whenever the necessity of the investigation requires it, proceed to areas within the jurisdiction of courts adjacent to the court where he performs his duties to conduct investigative actions, provided that he informs the Public Prosecutor of the relevant jurisdiction beforehand of his intended visit and includes the reasons for this visit in the investigative report.  He must also inform the Public Prosecutor assigned to the court to which he belongs.  If the latter is not present, he shall proceed with the necessary actions without waiting for his presence.
