The statute of limitations is suspended by any legal or material impediment preventing the execution of the punishment, except for impediments resulting from the will of the convicted person.

The convicted person, a defendant against whom a judgment—a written decision from the court resolving a legal issue or fact, determining his responsibility for a crime, and imposing a penalty or precautionary measure—has been rendered, the statute of limitations is interrupted by the arrest of the convicted person, a defendant against whom a judgment—a written decision from the court resolving a legal issue or fact, determining his responsibility for a crime, and imposing a penalty or precautionary measure—has been rendered, in the case of a sentence involving imprisonment or the competent authority undertaking an act of execution in the case of a fine. In no case may the statute of limitations be extended to more than double its original length.
