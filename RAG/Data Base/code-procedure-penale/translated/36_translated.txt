A person acting on behalf of another.

The Republic does not prevent the aggrieved party from bringing an action.

Action
[1] A request by one party from another in the presence of a judge; the requestor is called the plaintiff and the party requested is called the defendant. [2] An action is the right of every claimant to bring a claim before the court to obtain a judgment on its subject matter.  As regards the defendant, it is the right to present reasons for defense or arguments aimed at refuting that claim.

The public prosecutor, on his personal responsibility, in this instance, may, through the exercise of his personal right, either request referral of the case for investigation or proceed directly before the court.
