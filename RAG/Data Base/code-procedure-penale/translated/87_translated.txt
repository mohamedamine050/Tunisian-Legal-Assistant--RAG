(Amended by Law No. 114 of 1993, dated November 22, 1993). - The decision issued by the Investigating Judge.  The Investigating Judge is a judge who makes legal decisions in court and contributes to the enforcement of the law and the administration of justice.

The decision on granting, refusing, modifying, or lifting provisional release measures is appealable before the Indictment Chamber by the Public Prosecutor and the suspect or their lawyer within four days from the date of notification for the Public Prosecutor and from the date of information for others.  It is also appealable by the Attorney General within ten days following the issuance of the decision. An appeal by the Public Prosecutor prevents the execution of the release or measure decision. However, an appeal by the Attorney General does not prevent the execution of that decision. In case of appeal, the Investigating Judge shall immediately forward the case file to the Indictment Chamber. The Indictment Chamber must rule on the appeal within a maximum of eight days from the date of its receipt of the file. However, if the Investigating Judge does not rule on the release request within the time limit mentioned in Article 86, the suspect, their lawyer, or the Public Prosecutor may submit the request directly to the Indictment Chamber. The Attorney General must bring the file and submit their reasoned written requests within eight days, and the Chamber must rule on it within eight days from the date of its receipt of the file. A request for release submitted by the suspect or their lawyer cannot be renewed under any circumstances except after the expiration of one month from the date of the previous requestâ€™s rejection, unless new reasons appear.
