Land elders are tasked, within the limits of their territorial jurisdictions, with inspecting misdemeanors and offenses related to rural properties.  They are also responsible for drafting reports on the circumstances in which the crime occurred, collecting evidence, and tracing stolen items to their new locations and seizing them. However, they are not permitted to enter dwellings and their appurtenances unless accompanied by a judicial officer designated in articles 2, 3, and 4 of Article 10, and without exceeding the limits of the authority of these officers regarding the legal search of property for investigative purposes. The report drawn up in this regard shall be signed by those of the aforementioned officers who were present. They shall arrest anyone apprehended in the act of committing a misdemeanor or felony and bring them before the court or before one of the officers mentioned above.  Nevertheless, they are informed of all crimes that come to their knowledge in the direct course of their duties. Upon the request of the governor or a judicial officer, they must assist in uncovering the truth.
