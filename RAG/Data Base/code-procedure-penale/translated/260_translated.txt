A private party may not appeal decisions issued by the Indictment Chamber unless such appeal is also requested by the Public Prosecutor's Office.

The Public Prosecutor's Office is the body responsible for defending the interests of society and applying the law before the courts.

However, an appeal request by a private party alone may be accepted in the following circumstances:

First: If the Indictment Chamber's decision rules that there are no grounds for prosecution.

Second: If the decision rules that the claim is inadmissible.

Third: If the decision rules that the claim is extinguished by lapse of time.

Fourth: If the Indictment Chamber, either sua sponte or at the request of the parties, rules that the court seized lacks jurisdiction.

Fifth: If the decision fails to rule on one of the charges.
