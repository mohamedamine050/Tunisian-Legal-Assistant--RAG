The convicted person, a defendant against whom a judgment was rendered determining his responsibility for a crime and imposing a penalty or precautionary measure, upon revocation of conditional release—the release of the convicted person sentenced to a custodial penalty before the expiry of the entire term of his sentence, subject to conditions consisting of obligations imposed upon him, restricting his freedom, and representing a suspension of freedom conditional upon fulfilling these obligations—shall serve, as stipulated in the (*) decision, the whole or part of the unexpired portion of the sentence at the time of his release; this shall be served, if necessary, concurrently with the new penalty imposed.  The period spent in pre-trial detention shall be deducted from the sentence. If the conditional release—the release of the convicted person sentenced to a custodial penalty before the expiry of the entire term of his sentence, subject to conditions consisting of obligations imposed upon him, restricting his freedom, and representing a suspension of freedom conditional upon fulfilling these obligations—is not revoked before the expiry of the unexpired portion of the sentence at the time of the release of the convicted person, a defendant against whom a judgment was rendered determining his responsibility for a crime and imposing a penalty or precautionary measure, then the release becomes final. In this case, the sentence is deemed served from the date of the conditional release.
