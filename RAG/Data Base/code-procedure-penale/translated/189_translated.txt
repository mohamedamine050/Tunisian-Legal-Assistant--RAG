The court that initially heard the case retains jurisdiction to authorize the return of objects placed under its authority, provided no appeal has been lodged against the original judgment.  The court decides based on a petition submitted by the claimant or upon the request of the Public Prosecutor.  The Public Prosecutor is the body responsible for defending the interests of society and applying the law before the courts.  Its judgment may be appealed to the Court of Appeal, in accordance with the provisions of Article 188.
