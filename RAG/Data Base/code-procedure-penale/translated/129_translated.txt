(Amended by Law No. 85 of 2005 dated August 15, 2005). - The court which shall hear the case of the crime is the court [having jurisdiction] where the crime was committed or the court [having jurisdiction] where the suspectâ€™s residence is located or the court [having jurisdiction] where the suspect was found.  The court which first assumed jurisdiction over the case shall adjudicate it. If the crime was committed on board or against a ship or aircraft registered in Tunisia or chartered without crew to an operator whose principal place of business or permanent residence is in Tunisian territory, the competent court shall be the court [having jurisdiction] at the place of landing or mooring. This court shall also have jurisdiction, even if one of the aforementioned conditions is not met, if the aircraft landed or the ship moored in Tunisian territory and the suspect was on board.  A court is a place where litigation takes place between parties; it is a civil institution under the judicial authority which must have its independence within the three branches of government.
