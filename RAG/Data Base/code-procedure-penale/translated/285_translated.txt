Every public or private trustee of documents fabricated with forgery or documents suitable for expert examination is obligated to surrender them pursuant to a decision of the Investigating Judge.  The Investigating Judge is the person entrusted by the judiciary or the Public Prosecution to investigate the case. The aforementioned decision and the receipt for surrender exonerate him from all responsibility towards all concerned parties. In the event of failure to voluntarily surrender said documents, a search and seizure may be carried out in accordance with Articles 93 to 100.
