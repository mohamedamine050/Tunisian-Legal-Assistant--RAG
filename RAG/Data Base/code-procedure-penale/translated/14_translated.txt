It is incumbent upon the Investigating Judge, in his capacity as an officer of the judicial police, to examine any crime committed in his presence while directly performing his duties, or discovered during a legal search. However, except in the case of a crime committed in flagrante delicto, he is not authorized to undertake the case and cannot perform any act without a decision in that respect from the Public Prosecutor.
