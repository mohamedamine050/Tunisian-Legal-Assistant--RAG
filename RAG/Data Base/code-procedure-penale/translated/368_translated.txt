Recovery of rights may only be claimed from the convicted person.  The convicted person is a defendant against whom a judgment has been rendered determining their responsibility for a crime, and imposing a penalty or precautionary measure.  Or, if the convicted person is under legal guardianship, from their legal representative. In the event of the death of the convicted person, the claim may be submitted by their spouse, ascendants, or descendants within one year from the date of death. The Ministry of Justice shall conduct the necessary investigations into the claim.
