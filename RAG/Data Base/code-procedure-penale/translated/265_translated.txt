Appeal to the Court of Cassation

Appeal to the Court of Cassation is a remedy allowing recourse against a court decision deemed contrary to law or where procedure has not been respected.

Execution of the appealed judgment is not stayed except in cases of a death sentence or where the judgment concerns a judge's order for the destruction of forged evidence or the erasure of its traces, or the annulment of a marriage.
