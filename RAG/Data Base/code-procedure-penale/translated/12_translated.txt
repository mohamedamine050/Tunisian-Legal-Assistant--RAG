The district judges may conduct, within their respective jurisdictions, either personally or through the other officials referred to in Articles 3 to 6 of Chapter 10, all preliminary investigations. They may also temporarily detain suspects, provided that they are immediately presented to the nearest court.  The court is a civil body subordinate to the judicial authority, which must be independent within the three branches of government.  Furthermore, they receive notification of felonies and misdemeanors committed in their jurisdiction. They also inform the Public Prosecutor of all felonies and misdemeanors that come to their knowledge in the course of their duties, and they forward to him all related instructions, reports, and documents.
