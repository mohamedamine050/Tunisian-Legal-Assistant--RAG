The prosecution department may always issue a detention order.  The detention order is issued, dated, signed, and stamped by the investigating judge.  It clearly states the name and title of the judge, the name, approximate age, profession, birthplace, and residence of the suspect, and the subject matter of the charge, specifying the applicable legal provision. The order includes the judge's instruction to the chief prison warden to accept and detain the accused.  The prosecution department may also authorize the release of the detained suspect after hearing the representative of the public prosecution.
