The competent court or the investigating judge, the person delegated by the judiciary or the Public Prosecution, the body responsible for defending the interests of society and applying the law before the courts, shall examine the request to exercise the civil action and, if necessary, shall decide to reject it.  The rejection of the request may be raised by the representative of the Public Prosecution, the body responsible for defending the interests of society and applying the law before the courts, the accused, the civilly liable party, or any other party exercising the civil action. The competent court shall join the dispute to the main case and rule on both in a single judgment. However, if the prosecution concerns the liability, the obligation to respond to a person's actions before the law or compensate for the harm caused, of the party exercising the civil action, the court shall issue its judgment on the dispute immediately. The investigating judge, the person delegated by the judiciary or the Public Prosecution, the body responsible for defending the interests of society and applying the law before the courts, shall rule by decision after the representative of the Public Prosecution, the body responsible for defending the interests of society and applying the law before the courts, has reviewed the file. This decision is appealable before the Court of Appeal within four days from the date of review for the Public Prosecutor and from the date of notification for others.
