The exercise of the personal right is effected by means of a written request signed by the claimant or his representative, submitted, as the case may be, to the Attorney General, the Investigating Judge, or the court seized of the case. This request is exempt from security for costs; however, in the case provided for in Article 36, the claimant must secure the amount deemed necessary to cover the costs of the proceedings, failing which his right to proceed shall lapse.  The allocation of this amount shall be undertaken, as the case may be, by the President of the Court or the Investigating Judge.
