(Amended by Law No. 41 of 2010, dated July 26, 2010). - The Court of Appeal shall have final jurisdiction on appeal in misdemeanors judged by the lower court and in felonies judged by the primary criminal court.  The lower court is generally the first court to consider the dispute and render a decision. A court is a place where litigation between parties takes place; it is a civilian institution belonging to the judicial authority which must have its independence within the three branches of government.
