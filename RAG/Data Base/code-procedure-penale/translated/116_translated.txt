If the investigating chamber finds that the act is not a crime, or that there is insufficient evidence against the suspect, it shall issue its decision that there are no grounds for prosecution and shall order the release of the detained suspect and rule on the return of seized property. The investigating chamber shall retain jurisdiction to rule on the return of seized property that may be requested from it after the dismissal order is issued. If there is sufficient evidence to support the charge, the aforementioned chamber shall refer the accused to the competent court, with a report outlining its findings regarding each of the accused referred to it, concerning all aspects of the charges resulting from the proceedings.  The chamber also has the right, if necessary, to authorize a supplementary investigation by one of its counselors or by an investigating judge, a person appointed by the judiciary or the public prosecution – the body responsible for defending the interests of society and applying the law before the courts – to investigate the case. It also has the right to authorize a new investigation or to conduct an investigation itself or by proxy on matters that have not been investigated, after hearing the representative of the public prosecution—the person appointed by the group to act on its behalf.
