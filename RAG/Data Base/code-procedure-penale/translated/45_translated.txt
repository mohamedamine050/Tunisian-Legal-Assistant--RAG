If a decision of dismissal is issued following the exercise of a private right, the accused may claim compensation for damages.

Damages [1] are harm caused in violation of the law, affecting a person's body, mental or psychological health, reputation, property, or honor; [2] loss or damage to property, deprivation of comfort, impairment of physical well-being, reputation, or similar.  In crimes and quasi-crimes, damages are the actual losses suffered by the claimant, necessary expenses incurred or to be incurred to remedy the consequences of the harmful act, and any benefits deprived within the normal limits of the consequences of this act.

A claim [1] is a request by one party for their right from another in the presence of a judge; the requester is called the claimant and the one from whom the right is requested is called the defendant. [2] A claim is the right of every claimant to bring their case before the court for judgment. For the opponent, it is the right to present reasons for defense or arguments aimed at refuting that request.

The claim for compensation is submitted within three months from the date the dismissal decision becomes final to the Trial Court.

The Trial Court is usually the first court to consider the dispute and make a decision.  The Trial Court with jurisdiction in the criminal matter and within whose district the case was investigated is competent to hear the case. The court considers the request in chambers after hearing the arguments of the parties or their lawyers and the representative of the Public Prosecution.

The Public Prosecution is the body responsible for defending the interests of society and enforcing the law before the judicial courts.

The court issues its judgment in an open session. If the court orders compensation, it may authorize the publication of all or part of the judgment in a newspaper or several newspapers specified in the judgment, at the expense of the condemned party. The costs of publication shall be specified in the judgment.  Objections, where applicable, and appeals are subject to the forms and time limits of the general law in criminal matters. The appeal is brought before the Court of Appeal, which adjudicates it according to the procedures prescribed for the Trial Court.  The decision of the Court of Appeal may be appealed to the Court of Cassation, as is the case in criminal matters.
