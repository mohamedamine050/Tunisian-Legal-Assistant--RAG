(Amended by Law No. 43 of 2000 dated April 17, 2000). - In the event of a death sentence, the case file shall be immediately referred to the Attorney General at the Court of Appeal if the judgment is a first instance judgment, and to the Attorney General at the Court of Cassation if the judgment is an appeal judgment.  The Court of Cassation is considered the highest court in the judicial hierarchy; its function is justified by the principle of judicial review to oversee the proper application of the law by the courts of first instance.
