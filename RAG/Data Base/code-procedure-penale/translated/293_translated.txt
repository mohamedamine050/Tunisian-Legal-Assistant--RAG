The amendment decision shall be notified by the clerk of the Court of Cassation.  The Court of Cassation is a court where litigation takes place between parties; it is a civil court that falls under the judicial authority, which must have its independence within the three branches of government. The Court of Cassation is considered the highest court in the judicial hierarchy; this is justified by the principle of annulment to oversee the proper application of laws by the courts of first instance. The Public Prosecutor, the body responsible for defending the interests of society and applying the law before the judicial courts, is represented before the court to which the case is referred, before the court from which it is removed, and before the parties.
