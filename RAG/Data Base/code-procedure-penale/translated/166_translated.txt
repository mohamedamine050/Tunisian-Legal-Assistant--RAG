If the judgment is pronounced after deliberation, whether at the hearing or thereafter, an original copy of the judgment must be prepared in accordance with the requirements of Article 168 as soon as possible and, in any case, this period should not exceed ten days from the date of its issuance. The judges who issued the judgment must sign the copy, and if one of them is unable to sign after the judgment is pronounced, it shall be signed by the remaining judges, stating the reason for the absence of the signature.
