Conditional release, the release of a convicted person serving a custodial sentence before the completion of their entire sentence, is subject to conditions consisting of obligations imposed upon them, restricting their liberty, and representing a suspension of liberty conditional upon fulfilling these obligations.  This may only be granted to those convicts who have served a portion of, or the entirety of, their sentence equal to or exceeding: Firstly, half the term of the sentence or sentences for first-time offenders; provided that the term of sentence served by the convict—a defendant against whom a judgment has been rendered establishing their responsibility for a crime and imposing a penalty or precautionary measure—must not be less than three months. Secondly, two-thirds of the term of the sentence or sentences for convicts with prior convictions; provided that the term of sentence served by the convict—a defendant against whom a judgment has been rendered establishing their responsibility for a crime and imposing a penalty or precautionary measure—must not be less than six months. "The probationary period shall be fifteen years for those sentenced to life imprisonment" (amended by Article 3 of Law No. 23 of 1989, dated February 27, 1989).
