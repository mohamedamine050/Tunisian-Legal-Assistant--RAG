Any person who has been preventively detained or has served a prison sentence may claim compensation from the state for material and moral damages suffered as a result, in the following circumstances:  If a decision is issued to dismiss the charges, either because the act does not constitute a crime, or because the act did not occur, or because it cannot be attributed to the accused; if a prison sentence was issued against him, then his innocence was definitively established for the reasons mentioned above; if a judgment was issued against him on a matter previously judged.
