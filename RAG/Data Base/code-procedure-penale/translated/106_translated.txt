(Amended by Law No. 114 of 1993, dated November 22, 1993). - If the investigating judge finds that the claim is inadmissible, or that the acts do not constitute a crime, or that the evidence against the suspect is insufficient, he shall issue a decision that there is no basis for prosecution, order the release of the suspect if he is detained, and rule on the seized property. The investigating judge shall retain jurisdiction to rule on the seized property after the issuance of the decision that there is no basis for prosecution. If the investigating judge finds that the acts constitute a misdemeanor [misdemeanor is defined as crimes punishable by imprisonment exceeding fifteen days but not exceeding five years, or by a fine exceeding sixty dinars], he shall refer the suspect to the competent judge and order his release if he is detained. If he finds that the acts constitute a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment, he shall refer the suspect to the relevant court or the criminal court, as the case may be. The referral decision terminates the effect of any preventive detention measure or order. However, the investigating judge may, by a separate and reasoned decision, maintain the suspect's detention pursuant to a detention warrant or order until his appearance before the court, unless the court decides otherwise.
