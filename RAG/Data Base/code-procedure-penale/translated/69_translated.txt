The Investigating Judge, the person appointed by the judiciary or the Public Prosecution to investigate the case, shall establish the identity of the suspect.  Suspect means a person suspected of committing a crime before the charges are filed.  Upon the suspect's first appearance, the Investigating Judge shall inform him of the acts attributed to him and the applicable legal provisions. The Judge shall receive his response after informing him that he has the right not to answer except in the presence of a lawyer of his choice, and this notification shall be recorded in the minutes. If the suspect refuses to choose a lawyer or if the lawyer does not appear after being summoned as required, the proceedings shall continue without waiting for his presence. If the charge is a felony—felony meaning a serious crime punishable under the law with severe penalties such as imprisonment—and the suspect has not chosen a lawyer and requests the appointment of one to defend him, a lawyer shall be appointed. This appointment shall be made by the President of the Court and recorded in the minutes. Notwithstanding the foregoing paragraphs, the Investigating Judge may immediately conduct an interrogation or investigations if there is certainty resulting from the testimony of a witness in mortal danger, the existence of disappearing evidence, or if the suspect is apprehended in flagrante delicto. The interrogation must allow the suspect the opportunity to refute or admit the charges. If the suspect presents evidence refuting the charges, the Investigating Judge shall investigate its validity as soon as possible. The suspect's confession does not absolve the Investigating Judge from seeking further evidence.
