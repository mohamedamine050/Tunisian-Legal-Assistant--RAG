That which is pardoned is considered as if it never occurred. However, the grant of a pardon may be conditional upon the fulfillment of a specific condition by the convicted person.  A convicted person is a defendant against whom a judgment has been rendered, determining their responsibility for a crime, and imposing a penalty or precautionary measure.  A general pardon does not prejudice the rights of third parties, particularly the rights of the party with a personal right, and does not extend to court costs, even those not yet collected, nor to the confiscation of proceeds or seizure if executed, nor to fines that have been collected.
