If a foreigner is being investigated or prosecuted in Tunisia and a request for their extradition is received by the Tunisian government for another crime, extradition shall not take place until the investigation is concluded, or until the punishment is carried out if a trial has taken place.  However, this does not prevent the temporary transfer of the foreigner to appear before the courts of the requesting state, on the condition that they are returned as soon as the foreign court rules on the case.
