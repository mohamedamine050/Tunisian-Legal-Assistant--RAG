The judicial officers referred to in articles 2, 3, and 4 of Chapter 10 are assistants to the Public Prosecutor.  In felonies and misdemeanors committed in flagrante delicto, they have the same powers as the Public Prosecutor and must immediately inform him of their actions.  Otherwise, they may not undertake any investigative action unless authorized to do so in writing.
