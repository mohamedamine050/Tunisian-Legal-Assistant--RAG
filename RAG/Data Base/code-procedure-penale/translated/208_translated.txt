(Amended by Law No. 114 of 1993, dated November 22, 1993). - Each Court of Appeal shall include at least one criminal division composed of a presiding judge and two counselors.  In case of impossibility, the presiding judge may be replaced by a counselor from the Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal is a place where litigation takes place between parties, a civil entity under the judicial authority that must have its independence within the three powers of the state.  An appeal is a legal procedure allowing the chosen party to request a review of the judgment issued by the previous court.  The presiding judge and counselors may be replaced by two judges from the lower court. The lower court is often the first court to examine the dispute and make a decision. The Public Prosecutorâ€™s functions are exercised by the Public Prosecutor or one of his assistants. The function of court clerk is performed by one of the clerks of the Court of Appeal. However, the First President of the Court of Appeal may decide to add a counselor or counselors to the division's composition in cases requiring lengthy proceedings. The additional counselor(s) attend the hearing, and participate in deliberations only in the event of the absence of the official counselor(s).
