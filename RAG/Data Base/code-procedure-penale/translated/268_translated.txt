The Court of Cassation is a court where litigation takes place between specialists. It is a civil court under the judicial authority, which must have its independence within the three powers of the state.

The Court of Cassation is considered the highest court in the judicial hierarchy.  This is justified by the principle of annulment to oversee the proper application of laws by the courts of first instance.

It is composed of a President and two Counsellors and holds its sessions in the presence of a representative of the Public Prosecutor's Office.

The Public Prosecutor's Office is the body responsible for defending the interests of society and applying the law before the courts.

It is assisted by a clerk. The First President may deputize the most senior Counsellor to preside over the session if necessary. Any judge who participated in a judgment in the court of first instance or the Court of Appeal, or expressed an opinion in it as a representative of the Public Prosecutor's Office, cannot participate in the consideration of the appeal for review submitted concerning that judgment.
