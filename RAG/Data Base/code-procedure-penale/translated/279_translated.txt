Applications for reconsideration are submitted in all cases to the Secretary of State for Justice, who, where appropriate, refers them to the Public Prosecutor's Office.  The Public Prosecutor's Office is the body responsible for defending the interests of society and applying the law before the courts. The Public Prosecutor's Office then refers them to the court that issued the judgment under appeal.  This court may be composed of the same judges who issued the judgment.
