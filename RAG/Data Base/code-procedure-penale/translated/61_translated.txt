Every person summoned as a witness is obligated to attend and take the oath.  The oath, administered by one party to another in order to resolve the dispute between them, if evidence permitted by law to prove their claim is lacking, is based on the conscience, honor, and religious belief of that party.  The witness shall give their testimony taking into account the provisions of the Criminal Code concerning professional secrecy. If the witness fails to attend after being summoned, the Investigating Judge, after obtaining the opinion of the Public Prosecutor, may impose a fine ranging from ten to twenty dinars. If the witness subsequently attends and presents acceptable excuses, the Investigating Judge may, after obtaining the opinion of the Public Prosecutor, exempt them from the fine. If the witness fails to attend after a second summons, a warrant for their arrest may be issued. After obtaining the opinion of the Public Prosecutor, a fine ranging from ten to twenty dinars may be imposed on a witness who attends but refuses to take the oath, administered by one party to another in order to resolve the dispute between them, if evidence permitted by law to prove their claim is lacking, is based on the conscience, honor, and religious belief of that party, or to give their testimony.  A judgment imposing a fine on a witness pursuant to the preceding paragraphs is not subject to any form of appeal.
