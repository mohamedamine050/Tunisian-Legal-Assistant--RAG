Every person, other than the accused, the claimant in a personal action, or a party civilly liable, who claims entitlement to objects placed under the authority of the court may also request their return from the court seized of the case.  He may only access the records relating to the seizure. The court rules on the seized property by a separate judgment after hearing the parties.
