The right to request a review is granted in the first three cases to the following: 1) The Secretary of State for Justice; 2) The convicted person, or their legal representative if incapacitated, against whom a court judgment – a written decision resolving a legal or factual issue, determining their responsibility for a crime, and imposing a penalty or preventive measure – has been rendered; 3) The spouse of the convicted person, after their death or declared absence, as well as their children and heirs.  In the fourth case, the right to request a review is granted solely to the Secretary of State, after obtaining the opinion of the Public Prosecutors at the Court of Cassation and the Advisors at the Court of Cassation. The Court of Cassation, the highest court in the judicial hierarchy, is justified in this by the principle of annulment to oversee the proper application of laws by the courts of first instance, its President appointing these Prosecutors and Advisors.
