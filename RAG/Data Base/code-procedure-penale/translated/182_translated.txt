If the objector is present, and his objection, made during the trial proceedings by the defense or one of the parties to the suit, and usually the defendant, is procedurally admissible, then the judgment is annulled in all respects.  The case is then retried, and there is no need to summon witnesses previously heard in the session in which the default judgment was issued. Only the party who lodged the objection benefits from it.
