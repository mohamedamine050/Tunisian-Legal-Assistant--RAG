To the Court of Cassation, upon the request of the Attorney/Agent, a person acting on behalf of another,  the public prosecutor requests authorization to withdraw the case from any court—a place where litigation occurs between parties, a civil institution under the judicial authority which must have its independence within the three branches of government—of first instance or appeal, and transfer it to another court of the same level, considering the interests of public security or to avert a justified suspicion.
