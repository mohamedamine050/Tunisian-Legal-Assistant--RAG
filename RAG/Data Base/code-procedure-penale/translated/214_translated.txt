Execution of the judgment is stayed during the appeal period and while the appeal case is pending. However, the prison detention order remains in effect until the expiry of the initially imposed sentence. This applies if the appeal is lodged by the Public Prosecutor.  The Public Prosecutor is the entity responsible for defending the interests of society and applying the law before the courts.  Until a judgment is issued by the Court of Appeal, the appeal lodged after the deadline does not stay execution of the judgment. A court is a place where litigation takes place between the parties involved; it is a civil entity under the judicial authority that must have its independence within the three branches of government.
