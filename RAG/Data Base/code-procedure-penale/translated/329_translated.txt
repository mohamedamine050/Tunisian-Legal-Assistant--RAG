The person surrendered cannot be prosecuted or investigated for any prior offense other than that for which extradition was requested, unless the Tunisian government expressly consents.  In this case, the prosecution department may express its opinion based solely on the submission of supporting documents for the new request.  Any observations offered by the extradited person in their defense may be explained by a lawyer of their choice.
