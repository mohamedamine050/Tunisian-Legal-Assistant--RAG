(Amended by Law No. 114 of 1993, dated November 22, 1993.) – A suspect may be placed in preventive detention in cases of felonies and misdemeanors committed in flagrante delicto, as well as whenever strong evidence warrants such detention as a security measure to prevent the commission of new crimes or to guarantee the execution of the punishment. Punishment is a sanction and remedy imposed in the name of society upon a person criminally responsible for a crime committed, based on a court judgment, or a method ensuring the smooth running of the investigation. Preventive detention in the cases stipulated in the preceding paragraph may not exceed six months. The decision regarding preventive detention shall be reasoned and shall include the factual and legal grounds justifying it. (Paragraph 2 amended by Law No. 21 of 2008, dated March 4, 2008.) If the interests of the investigation require that the suspect remain in detention, the investigating judge, after obtaining the opinion of the Public Prosecutor, may, by a reasoned decision, extend the detention period for misdemeanors once for a period not exceeding three months, and for felonies twice, each time not exceeding four months. The decision ordering the aforementioned is subject to appeal. A decision by the Examining Magistrate’s Chamber to refer the file to the investigating judge to pursue certain actions necessary for preparing the case for judgment shall not result in exceeding the maximum period of preventive detention. In this case, the investigating judge or the Examining Magistrate’s Chamber, as the case may be, shall be required to authorize his temporary release, without this preventing the taking of necessary measures to ensure his presence. (The penultimate paragraph added by Law No. 75 of 2008, dated December 11, 2008.) Release, with or without bail, is mandatory after five days of interrogation for a suspect who has a fixed address in Tunisian territory and has not previously been sentenced to more than six months' imprisonment, if the maximum penalty provided for by law does not exceed two years' imprisonment, except for the crimes stipulated in Articles 68, 70 and 217 of the Penal Code. (The last paragraph amended by Law No. 75 of 2008, dated December 11, 2008.)
