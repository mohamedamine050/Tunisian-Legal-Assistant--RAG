Except as provided for in the preceding article, the prosecution department shall, in its submission for extradition, issue a reasoned opinion that is not subject to any form of appeal.  If the prosecution department finds that the legal conditions for extradition are not met or that there is a manifest error, it shall issue its opinion rejecting extradition. This opinion is final, and extradition cannot be granted in such a case.
