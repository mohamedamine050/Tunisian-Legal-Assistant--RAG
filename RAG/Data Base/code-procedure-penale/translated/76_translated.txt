The Investigating Judge, the person appointed by the judiciary or the Public Prosecutor's Office to investigate the case, shall present to the suspect the seized items so that he may declare whether he recognizes them and shall note any observations he deems useful.  The term "suspicion" refers to the presumption of the commission of a crime before the charges are filed.
