The Court of Cassation, a court where litigation takes place between the parties involved, is a civil court under the judicial authority which must have its independence within the three branches of government.

The Court of Cassation is considered the highest court in the judicial hierarchy.  This is justified by the principle of cassation to oversee the proper application of laws by the courts of first instance.

It rules on requests for amendment between judges and handles them based on a request from the Attorney General at the aforementioned court. It decides on the referral of the case to the court it deems competent and annuls the actions taken by the court from which the case was removed. If two courts decide that the case falls outside their jurisdiction, the referral must be to another court.
