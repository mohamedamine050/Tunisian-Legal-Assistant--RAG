The lawsuit is extinguished:

[1] A lawsuit arises when one party claims a right against another in the presence of a judge; the claimant is called the plaintiff, and the party against whom the claim is made is called the defendant. [2] A lawsuit is the right of any claimant to bring their claim before a court to obtain a judgment in their favor.  For the opposing party, it is the right to present defenses or arguments aimed at refuting that claim.

General grounds for extinction: Firstly, by the death of the accused; secondly, by the passage of time (statute of limitations); thirdly, by general amnesty; fourthly, by the repeal of the penal provision; fifthly, by the res judicata; sixthly, by settlement, if the law explicitly provides for it; seventhly, by the withdrawal of the complaint, if this is a necessary condition for prosecution. The withdrawal by one of the accused constitutes a withdrawal for all others.
