In all cases where it appears necessary to hear a detained person, the court seized of the case may issue a commission to the President of the nearest Primary Court to the place of detention.  The Primary Court is often the first court to examine the dispute and render a decision. The President of the court may assign a judge to hear the detainee, with the drafting of a record thereof.
