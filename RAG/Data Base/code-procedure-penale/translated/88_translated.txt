The decision granting provisional release to the suspect does not prevent the Investigating Judge, appointed by the judiciary or the Public Prosecution – the body responsible for defending the interests of society and applying the law before the courts –  from issuing a warrant of committal  if the need arises due to the suspect's failure to appear after being summoned, or due to the emergence of new and serious circumstances.  The warrant of committal is drawn up, dated, signed, and stamped by the Investigating Judge. It clearly states the name and title of the judge, the suspect's name, approximate age, profession, place of birth, residence, and the subject of the charge, specifying the applicable legal text. It includes the order from the judge to the chief prison warden to accept and detain the accused. However, if the provisional release was granted by the Indictment Chamber after overturning the Investigating Judge’s decision, the Investigating Judge may not issue a new warrant of committal except after a decision from that Chamber approving it, after hearing the representative of the Public Prosecution.
