The defendant, the claimant, or any other party involved in the case, if, for any of the reasons set forth in the Code of Civil Procedure, believes that a judge has acted improperly, must submit a petition to the President of the Court of Appeal. The petition must be signed by the applicant, setting forth the matters that may constitute grounds for the alleged impropriety, and accompanied by the necessary supporting documents.  The applicant is the person who initiated the legal proceedings.  Such impropriety includes conduct that incites or encourages hatred, disgust, contempt, or severe ridicule on account of a person's race or religion.
