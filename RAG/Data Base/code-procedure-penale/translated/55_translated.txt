It is within the power of the Public Prosecutor to request from the Investigating Judge, the person entrusted by the judiciary or the Public Prosecution to investigate the case, in the decision opening the investigation and at every stage of the investigation, by means of a supplementary decision, the carrying out of such actions as he deems necessary to uncover the truth.  To this end, he may request access to all the case files, provided that he returns them to the Investigating Judge within forty-eight hours. If the Investigating Judge considers that there is no necessity for the actions requested of him, he must issue a reasoned decision within three days of the Public Prosecutor's requests. This decision is subject to appeal before the Court of Appeal within four days of its notification.
