Any person claiming entitlement to objects placed under judicial custody may request their return from the Investigating Judge.  If the latter refuses, the request may be made to the Court of First Instance. Each shall decide based solely on the request. Any seized object whose owner does not claim it within three years from the date of the preservation order or the judgment becomes the property of the State.
