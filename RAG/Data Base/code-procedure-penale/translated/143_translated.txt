The presiding judge manages the proceedings and maintains order in the courtroom.  Proceedings are public and recorded in the presence of a representative of the Public Prosecutor's Office.

The Public Prosecutor's Office is the body responsible for defending the interests of society and applying the law before the courts.

The parties, except if the court, on its own initiative or at the request of the representative of the Public Prosecutor's Office, deems it necessary to hold the proceedings in camera to maintain public order or respect morality, a decision which shall be recorded in the court minutes. The proceedings commence with hearing the complainant, if present and not acting in a personal capacity.  Then, the case file is presented, witnesses and experts are called, and any challenges to their credibility are addressed.  The court rules on these challenges and hears their statements as necessary. The suspect and the civilly liable party are questioned.  Where appropriate, the objects seized, which either support or refute the charges, are presented to the witnesses and parties.  Parties and their lawyers may only ask questions through the presiding judge. The necessary confrontations are conducted.  The party acting in a personal capacity presents their observations personally or through a lawyer. The representative of the Public Prosecutor's Office poses questions through the presiding judge, then presents their requests. The suspect and the civilly liable party have the right of reply. Finally, the word is given to the representatives of the suspect and the civilly liable party. The presiding judge concludes the proceedings when the court deems that the case has been sufficiently clarified. The court may instruct one of its members to conduct a supplementary investigation; in such a case, the remainder of the proceedings is adjourned to a specified date.
