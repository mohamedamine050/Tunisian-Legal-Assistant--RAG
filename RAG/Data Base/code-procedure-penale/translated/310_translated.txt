The government may extradite to foreign governments, upon their request, any non-Tunisian person found within the territory of the Tunisian Republic who is the subject of a written judgment issued by their courts.  However, extradition may only be granted if the crime for which extradition is sought was committed: within the territory of the requesting state by one of its nationals or a foreigner; or outside its territory by one of its nationals; or outside its territory by a foreigner, if the crime is one that Tunisian law permits to be prosecuted in Tunisia, even if committed abroad by a foreigner.
