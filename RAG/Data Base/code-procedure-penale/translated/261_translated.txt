(Paragraph one amended by Law No. 26 of 2007 dated May 7, 2007). - An appeal to the Court of Cassation is a remedy allowing an appeal against a court decision deemed contrary to law or where procedure has not been respected.  It is filed by written petition, directly or through a lawyer, to the registry of the court that issued the appealed judgment or decision. If the appellant is imprisoned, the chief prison warden is responsible for receiving the request and forwarding it without delay to the registry of that court. The clerk who receives the petition signs it, notes the date of submission, immediately registers it in a special register kept for this purpose, and issues a receipt including the date of submission, and immediately notifies the registry of the Court of Cassation.

A court is a place where litigation takes place between parties; it is a civil institution under the judicial authority that must have its independence within the three branches of government. The Court of Cassation is the highest court in the judicial hierarchy. This is justified by the principle of annulment to oversee the proper application of laws by courts of first instance.  The appellant proceeds by any means leaving a written record, then notifies the appellee and forwards the case file, along with the appeal petition and a copy of the appealed judgment or decision, to the registry of the Court of Cassation. (Paragraph three added by Law No. 26 of 2007 dated May 7, 2007). The court clerk, a judicial official responsible for maintaining records and managing court documents, of the court that issued the appealed judgment shall summon the appellant or his lawyer, as the case may be, administratively and provide him with a copy of the appealed judgment against a receipt including the date of delivery, which shall be added to the case file. (Paragraph four added by Law No. 75 of 2008 dated December 11, 2008). If the appellant or his lawyer fails to collect a copy of the appealed judgment within one month of being summoned by any means leaving a written record, and fails to submit the appeal documents, the appeal shall be dismissed. (Paragraph five added by Law No. 75 of 2008 dated December 11, 2008).
