If a document from the proceedings or a submitted document is alleged to be forged during the hearing, the court, after hearing the observations of the Public Prosecutor,  the body responsible for defending the interests of society and applying the law before the judicial courts, and the parties, will decide whether it is appropriate to stay the proceedings pending a decision on the forgery by the competent court. If the Public Prosecutor's office is unable to act or if proving forgery is impossible, and it is not clear that the submitter of the document intentionally used a forged document, then the court seized of the original case will decide directly on the nature of the allegedly forged document.
