Crimes are considered connected: Firstly, when committed by several persons together, even if they do not have a single purpose. Secondly, when committed by several persons, even at different times and places, but based on a prior agreement between them. Thirdly, when committed, even if not by multiple offenders, to obtain something that can be used to commit other crimes, or to facilitate their commission, or to complete their commission, or to aid those who committed them in escaping punishment.
