The Public Prosecutor may also appeal if the judgement harms the rights of the accused, a civilly liable party, or a party with a personal right. The Court of Appeal shall not entertain an appeal until the lower court has issued its original judgment.  The lower court is usually the first court to consider the dispute and issue a decision.
