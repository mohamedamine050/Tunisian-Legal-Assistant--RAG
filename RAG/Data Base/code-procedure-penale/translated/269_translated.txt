The Court of Cassation, a court where litigation takes place between the parties involved, is a civil court under the judicial authority which must have its independence within the three branches of government.

The Court of Cassation is considered the highest court in the judicial hierarchy; this is justified by the principle of cassation to oversee the proper application of laws by the courts of first instance.

The Court of Cassation examines the subject matter of the judgment only within the limits of the appeals raised, unless the judgment is indivisible.  It must, where necessary, raise appeals concerning public order of its own motion. If the appeal is accepted, it shall quash the judgment in whole or in part and order the referral of the case to the court of first instance for reconsideration within the limits of the quashing. However, it may quash the judgment without referral if the deletion of the quashed part obviates the need for reconsideration or if the quashing leaves nothing requiring judgment.
