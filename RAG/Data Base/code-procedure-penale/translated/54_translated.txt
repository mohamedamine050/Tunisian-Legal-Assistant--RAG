The Investigating Judge may, personally or through the judicial police officers specified in articles 3 and 4 of Article 10, conduct an inquiry into the identity of the suspects, and into their material, family, and social circumstances.  He may also authorize a psychiatric examination of the accused.  Such psychiatric examination shall be mandatory if the accused committed a crime before the expiration of ten years following the completion of the first punishment or its remission or extinction by lapse of time, and if both crimes warranted imprisonment for a term of ten years or more. (Added by Law No. 93 of 2005, dated October 3, 2005).
