If the court finds that the act does not constitute a crime, or that it is not proven, or that it cannot be attributed to the accused, it shall order his release. If there is a party with a private right of action, the court shall relinquish consideration of the personal claim and shall order the accused to bear the costs, after their assessment. If the court finds that the act constitutes a crime, it shall issue a judgment of punishment.
