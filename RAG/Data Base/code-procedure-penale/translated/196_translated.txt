If a certified copy (or an official document) bearing the form required for enforceability, or an extract of the judgment, can be found, it shall stand in place of the original and shall be kept by the court registry.  To this end, every public or private custodian of a certified copy (or an official document) bearing the form required for enforceability, or an extract of the judgment, is obligated to deliver it to the court registry upon order of the presiding judge of that court. In the event of non-compliance, a search and seizure may be conducted in accordance with Articles 93 to 100. The custodian of the certified copy or extract may obtain a free copy thereof upon delivery to the court registry.
