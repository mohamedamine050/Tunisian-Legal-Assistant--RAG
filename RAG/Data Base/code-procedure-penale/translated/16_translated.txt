If multiple officers are entrusted with a single case, the officer to whom the case was initially submitted shall proceed.  The judicial police officers empowered under Article 12 are authorized to require other officers to relinquish cases from those previously assigned, for the purpose of personally handling them. However, judicial police officers must always relinquish the case as soon as a representative of the Republic, their assistant, or an investigating judge takes charge, along with the suspect and the prepared reports and seized items for the purpose of uncovering the truth.  The term "suspect" refers to the suspicion of committing a crime before the charges are filed.
