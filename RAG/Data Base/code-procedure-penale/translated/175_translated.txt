If notification reaches the accused person and they do not appear within the specified time, the judge shall not await their appearance and shall issue a judgment considered to be in their presence. If the accused is legally summoned and does not appear, they shall be judged in absentia, even if the summons did not reach them personally. Notification of the in absentia judgment shall be undertaken by the court clerk, a judicial official responsible for maintaining the records and managing the documents of the court that issued the judgment.  An objection to an in absentia judgment shall be submitted to the registry of the court that issued it by the objector or their representative within ten days following the date of notification. If the objector resides outside the territory of the Republic, the deadline shall be thirty days. If the objector is detained, the objection shall be received by the chief prison warden and forwarded without delay to the court registry. The objection shall be submitted either by an oral statement recorded in writing at the time or by a written notification. The objector must sign it; if they refuse to sign or are unable to do so, this shall be stated. The court clerk shall arrange the hearing and inform the objector of its date. In all cases, the hearing must be held within a maximum of one month from the date of the objection. The objector or their representative shall inform the opposing parties concerned, except for the representative of the Public Prosecutor's Office, of the objection and summon them to the hearing through a bailiff at least three days before its date; otherwise, their objection shall be rejected.  A party with a personal right shall only be summoned if the purpose of the objection is to present the civil claim anew to the judge.
