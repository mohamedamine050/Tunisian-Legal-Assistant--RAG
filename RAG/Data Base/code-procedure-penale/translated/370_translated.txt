Restoration of Rights of the Convicted Person

The convicted person is a defendant against whom a judgment has been rendered, determining their responsibility for a crime, and imposing a penalty or precautionary measure.  This restores, for the future, the penalties imposed and any resulting disqualifications, recording this in the criminal record.  These penalties must not be mentioned in the documents issued to the applicant.
