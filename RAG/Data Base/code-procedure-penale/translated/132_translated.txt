Courts may rule in accordance with the rules of the Civil Code, the Civil Code, and the legal discipline governing relations between individuals and private entities arising from contracts, in preliminary matters of a civil nature.  The material aspect of civilization, such as urban development, means of communication, and entertainment, is matched by the intellectual, spiritual, and ethical aspects of civilization.  This applies to issues raised during a criminal case, provided that those courts have the right to consider them civilly; otherwise, they must postpone consideration until a written judgment from the court resolves a legal or factual issue.  The preliminary issue becomes final unless the law dictates otherwise. A preliminary issue is not accepted if it appears to be merely dilatory and has no particular and direct effect on the proceedings. A time limit is set for the claimant or suspect to submit the issue to the competent court. If that time limit expires and they fail to do so, the proceedings are resumed. Consideration of the crime is not suspended if it relates to acts of violence or insubordination.
