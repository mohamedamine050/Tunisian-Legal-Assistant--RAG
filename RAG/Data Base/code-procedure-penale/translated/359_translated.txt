(Amended by Law No. 73 of 2001 dated July 11, 2001). - If a written judgment from the court resolves a legal or factual issue, and the beneficiary of conditional release violates or re-offends, the Minister of Justice may cancel the release by decision after obtaining the opinion of the Conditional Release Committee. Conditional release is the release of a person sentenced to imprisonment before the full expiry of their sentence, subject to conditions consisting of obligations imposed on them, restricting their liberty, and representing a suspension of liberty conditional upon fulfilling these obligations.  In case of confirmation, the Public Prosecutor may authorize the preventive detention of the person concerned, provided that the matter is immediately referred to the Conditional Release Committee.
