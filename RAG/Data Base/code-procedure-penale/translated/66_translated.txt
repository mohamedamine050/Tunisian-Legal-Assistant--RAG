If the suspect – whereby suspicion refers to the presumption of committing a crime before the charge is filed – or the witnesses do not speak Arabic, the investigating judge shall appoint a translator.  The investigating judge is the person entrusted by the judiciary or the Public Prosecution to investigate the case. If the witness or the suspect – whereby suspicion refers to the presumption of committing a crime before the charge is filed – is deaf or mute, the questions shall be presented to him/her in writing, and he/she shall answer in writing. If he/she is illiterate, a translator shall be appointed who is able or accustomed to communicate with him/her. The translator, if not sworn, shall take an oath – the oath administered by one of the parties to the other party to resolve the dispute between them if the evidence permitted by law to prove his claim is lacking, relying on the conscience, integrity and religion of this party – to translate truthfully and completely. His/her name, surname, age, profession, address shall be recorded in the report, and he/she shall sign the report as a witness.
