If surrender is requested simultaneously from several states for a single crime, it shall be granted first to the state whose interests the crime aimed to harm, or in whose territory the crime was committed. If multiple requests are submitted for different crimes, all circumstances shall be considered in granting priority, particularly the seriousness of the crime, the place of its commission, and the date of receipt of the requests.
