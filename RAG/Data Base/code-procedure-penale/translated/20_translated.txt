The Public Prosecution

The Public Prosecution is the body responsible for defending the interests of society and applying the law before the judicial courts.  It initiates legal proceedings.

[1] A request by one party for another party to fulfill an obligation, in the presence of a judge; the requesting party is called the plaintiff and the party from whom the request is made is called the defendant. [2] A lawsuit is the right of anyone with a claim to bring it before the courts for a judgment on its merits.  It is, for the opposing party, the right to present reasons for defense or arguments aimed at refuting that claim. The Public Prosecution exercises its functions and requests the application of the law, and undertakes the execution of judgments.
