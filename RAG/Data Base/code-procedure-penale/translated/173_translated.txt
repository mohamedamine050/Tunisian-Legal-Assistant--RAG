If the suspect is at liberty and is sentenced to imprisonment or to imprisonment and a fine, the court may authorize the immediate execution of the imprisonment sentence without regard to objection or appeal.  In the event of a judgment of acquittal or of imprisonment with a suspended sentence, the court, in all instances where the law does not prohibit it, may order the suspension of execution of a judicial or administrative decision.  In the case of a fine, the suspect shall be immediately released without regard to appeal.
