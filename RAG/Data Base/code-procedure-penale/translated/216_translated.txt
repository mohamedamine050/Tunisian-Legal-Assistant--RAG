If the appeal is filed by a representative, appointed by the group to act on its behalf,  of the Public Prosecution, the Court of Appeal may uphold or overturn the judgment, either in whole or in part, for or against the accused. If the appeal is filed by the accused or the civilly liable party only, the Court may not worsen the appellant's situation. If the appeal is filed by the party asserting a personal right only, the Court may not amend the judgment in a manner prejudicial to their rights.
