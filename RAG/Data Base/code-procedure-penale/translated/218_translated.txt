If the appealed judgment was originally issued by a Court of Appeal—a court where litigation takes place between the parties, a civil court under the judicial authority that must have its independence within the three branches of government—and the Court of Appeal finds procedural irregularities, it shall correct such irregularities and rule on the merits. If the judgment is voidable, the Court of Appeal shall address the merits and rule thereon.
