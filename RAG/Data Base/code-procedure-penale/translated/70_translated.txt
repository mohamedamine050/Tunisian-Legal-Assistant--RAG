The detained suspect is permitted to contact his lawyer at any time from the moment of his first appearance.  The Investigating Judge may, by a reasoned decision not subject to appeal, prohibit contact with the detained suspect for a period of ten days. This prohibition may be renewed, but only for a further ten days. This prohibition does not in any case apply to the suspect's lawyer.
