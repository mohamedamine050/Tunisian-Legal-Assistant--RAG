The Public Prosecutor at the Court of Cassation, a court where litigation takes place between parties, is a civil institution under the judicial authority which must have its independence within the three branches of government.  The Court of Cassation, a court where litigation takes place between parties, is a civil institution under the judicial authority which must have its independence within the three branches of government. The Court of Cassation is considered the highest court in the judicial hierarchy; this is justified by the principle of cassation to oversee the proper application of the law by courts of first instance.  Despite the expiry of the appeal period, the Public Prosecutor may appeal the judgment in the interest of the law if it contains a violation of the law and neither party appealed it initially. The decision to accept the appeal is limited to correcting the legal error without referral, and cannot affect the rights of the parties and third parties acquired under the appealed judgment.
