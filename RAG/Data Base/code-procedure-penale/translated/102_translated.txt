Every decision appointing experts shall specify the deadline within which they must complete their mission.  The deadline may be extended upon the experts' request and by a reasoned decision issued by the Investigating Judge.

The Investigating Judge is the person appointed by the judiciary or the Public Prosecutor's Office to investigate the case.  The Investigating Judge may replace them if special reasons warrant it. If the experts do not submit their report within the specified deadline, they may be immediately replaced. They must submit the results of their research and return the objects, documents, and papers entrusted to them for the execution of their mission within forty-eight hours. They may also be compelled to reimburse all or part of the advances paid to them by a decision that is not subject to appeal and is enforceable according to the forms provided in the Code of Civil Procedure.

Experts must carry out their mission in liaison with the Investigating Judge and keep him informed of the progress of the examinations and provide him with everything that enables him at any time to take the necessary measures.  They may, in addition, be subject to disciplinary sanctions.
