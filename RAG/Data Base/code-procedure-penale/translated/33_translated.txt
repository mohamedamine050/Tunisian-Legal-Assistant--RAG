A felony or misdemeanor is considered to be in flagrante delicto: Firstly, if the act is committed directly in the present moment or shortly thereafter. Secondly, if the suspect is pursued by the public shouting behind him, or if the suspect is found carrying belongings, or bearing traces or signs indicating a likely conviction, provided that this occurs very shortly after the commission of the act.  Suspicion refers to the presumption of committing a crime before the accusation is made. A felony or misdemeanor in flagrante delicto is similar to any felony or misdemeanor committed in a dwelling where the owner has summoned a judicial officer to ascertain the crime, even if it was not committed under the circumstances outlined in the previous paragraph. A felony is a serious crime punishable under the law and subject to severe penalties such as imprisonment. A misdemeanor is defined as a crime punishable by imprisonment exceeding fifteen days but not exceeding five years, or by a fine exceeding sixty dinars.
