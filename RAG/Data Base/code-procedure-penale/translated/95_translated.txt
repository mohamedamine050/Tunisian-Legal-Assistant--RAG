Searches of dwellings and their appurtenances may not be carried out before 6:00 AM or after 8:00 PM, except in cases of flagrant felonies or misdemeanors, or if the situation necessitates entry into a dwelling, even without the owner's consent, for the purpose of apprehending a suspect or an escaped prisoner.
