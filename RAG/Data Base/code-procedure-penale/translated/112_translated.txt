Each Court of Appeal shall include at least one criminal division.  The criminal division consists of a presiding judge and counselors. In case of impediment, the presiding judge may be replaced by a counselor.  The appeal is a legal procedure that allows the chosen party to request a review of the judgment issued by the previous court.  Accusation is the act of charging someone with a specific crime before the judicial authorities. The Court is a place where litigation takes place between the parties involved; it is a civil entity under the judicial authority which must have its independence within the three branches of government.  The presiding judge and counselors of the Court of Appeal are judges from the Court of First Instance. The Court of First Instance is usually the first court to hear a dispute and render a decision. The criminal division meets at the request of the Public Prosecutor whenever necessary.
