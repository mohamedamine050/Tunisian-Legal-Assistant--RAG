The applicant for revision shall advance the costs of the case until the decision accepting the application is issued.  Subsequent costs shall be advanced by the State Treasury. If the final decision or judgment issued in the revision application orders the imposition of a penalty, the convicted person shall bear the costs. The convicted person, a defendant against whom a judgment—a written decision of the court resolving a legal issue or a matter of fact—has been rendered, has been found responsible for a crime, and has been sentenced or subjected to a precautionary measure, shall bear the costs.  The costs shall be reimbursed to the State Treasury and to the applicant for revision, if necessary. The applicant for revision shall be ordered to bear all costs if their application is rejected.  The decision or judgment issued in the revision application that acquits the applicant is subject to notification, if the applicant—the person who initiated the legal proceedings—so desires, in the city where the judgment imposing the penalty was rendered, and in the region where the felony or misdemeanor was committed, and in the region where the applicant for revision resides, and the place of last residence of the person against whom the judicial error occurred, if deceased.  Notification, under the same conditions, is also authorized by publication of the judgment or decision of acquittal in the Official Gazette of the Tunisian Republic and publication of its summary in two daily newspapers chosen by the applicant for revision. The costs of the aforementioned publication shall be borne by the State Treasury.
