(Added by Law No. 113 of 1993, dated November 22, 1993). - Anyone who commits outside Tunisian territory, whether as a principal offender or accomplice, a felony or a misdemeanor, may be prosecuted and tried by Tunisian courts if the victim is a Tunisian national.  Nationality is a legal and political link between an individual and a specific state, which includes this individual among its constituent population. This link therefore establishes mutual rights and obligations between them. Prosecution shall only be initiated upon request by the Public Prosecutor's Office, based on a complaint from the victim or their heirs.  Prosecution may not be initiated if the accused proves that he has been definitively judged abroad, and in the event of being sentenced, that he has served the sentence imposed on him, or that it has lapsed due to the passage of time, or that it has been covered by a pardon. A felony is a serious crime punishable under the law and subject to severe penalties such as imprisonment. A judgment is a written decision of a court resolving a legal or factual issue.
