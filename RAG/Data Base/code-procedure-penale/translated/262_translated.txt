(The first paragraph was amended by Law No. 26 of 2007, dated May 7, 2007.) - An appeal to the Court of Cassation shall not be admissible except in cases of force majeure, if it is not submitted to the registry of the court that issued the judgment within ten days from the date of the judgment delivered in the presence of the parties, or from the date of notification of the judgment considered as served in the meaning of the first paragraph of Article 175, or from the date of expiry of the period for appeal if the judgment was in absentia, or from the date of notification of the judgment rejecting the appeal. This period is extended to sixty days from the date of the judgment for an appeal by the Attorney General to the Court of Cassation.  The Court of Cassation is considered the highest court in the judicial hierarchy; this is justified by the principle of cassation to supervise the proper application of laws by courts of first instance.  The appeal must comply with the conditions of Article 258 and the defendants and civil respondents must be notified of this appeal within the aforementioned period; otherwise, the right to appeal shall lapse. In cases of a death sentence, the period shall be only five days.  An appeal against the decisions of the Court of Appeal must be lodged within four days of notification or knowledge thereof.
