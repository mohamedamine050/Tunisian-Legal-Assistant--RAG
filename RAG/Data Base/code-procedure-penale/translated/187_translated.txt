If the court finds that the objects placed under its jurisdiction are useful for uncovering the truth or are likely to be clarified, it shall suspend consideration of the claim for restitution until a judgment is issued.  This judgment, a written decision of the court resolving a legal issue or fact, is final. In this instance, the judgment is not subject to any form of appeal.
