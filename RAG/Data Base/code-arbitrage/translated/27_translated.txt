If a preliminary issue arises that falls outside the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal and is related to the arbitration, the arbitral tribunal shall suspend the proceedings pending a decision by the court on the matter.  The time limit for the arbitral award shall be suspended accordingly until the arbitral tribunal is notified of the final decision on the preliminary issue.
