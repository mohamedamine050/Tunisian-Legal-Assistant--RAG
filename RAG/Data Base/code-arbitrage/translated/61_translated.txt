## English Translation:

**1.** The arbitral tribunal shall decide on its jurisdiction, and on any objection raised concerning its existence or validity. For this purpose, the arbitration clause in the contract shall be considered as an agreement separate from its other clauses. A judgment declaring the contract void shall not legally result in the invalidation of the arbitration clause. 

**2.**  An objection concerning the lack of jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal shall be raised within a time limit not exceeding the submission of the written observations in defense in the original proceedings. 

No party may be prevented from raising such an objection on the grounds that it appointed one of the arbitrators or participated in their appointment. As for the objection that the arbitral tribunal has exceeded its scope of examination, it must be raised as soon as the issue which is alleged to be outside its scope is raised during the arbitration proceedings. 

In both cases, the arbitral tribunal may accept an objection raised after the deadline if it deems the delay justified.

**3.** If the arbitral tribunal decides on any objection concerning those mentioned in paragraph 2 of this chapter by a partial judgment, any party may, within thirty days from the date of being notified of the judgment, request the Court of Appeal in Tunis to decide on the matter in accordance with the provisions of Article 78 of this Code. 

The subject matter must be decided as quickly as possible, and in any event within a period not exceeding three months from the date of the request.

The continuation of the proceedings shall be contingent upon the outcome of the judgment on appeal.

As for objections raised after the issuance of the arbitral award, they shall be examined along with the original proceedings.
