Each party may enforce the award within their own scope of authority, unless the arbitration relates to a dispute already pending before a **Court of Appeal**. In such cases, the presiding judge of the **Court of Appeal** shall have the sole right to grant authorization for enforcement when the arbitration agreement is concluded.

The arbitral tribunal shall deliver a copy of the judgment to the parties within 15 days of its issuance. Within the same period, the original judgment, accompanied by the arbitration agreement, shall be deposited with the competent court in exchange for a receipt. This deposit shall not be subject to any payment.

Any interested party may inform the other party in accordance with the Code of Civil and Commercial Procedures, and the time limits for appeals shall apply accordingly.

If one of the parties wishes to obtain authorization for the enforcement of the arbitral award, the presiding judge of the competent court shall examine the request. If no objection is found, the judge shall grant authorization for enforcement and shall issue the order beneath the judgment.

As a matter of law, an appeal may be filed against the authorization for enforcement or the waiver of enforcement by the **Judge**—if such an appeal is permissible—with respect to the subject matter of the appeal.

The original judgment shall remain deposited with the court, while executable or summary copies shall be issued in accordance with the procedures stipulated in the relevant legislation.

If the presiding judge of the competent court rejects the request, the refusal shall be reasoned and subject to appeal.
