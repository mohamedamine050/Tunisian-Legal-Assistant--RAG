## English Translation:

**1.** The claimant, within the time period agreed upon by the parties or determined by the arbitral tribunal, shall set forth the facts supporting his claim, the issues in dispute, and his requests. The defendant, the person against whom the claim is directed or the person claiming, shall present his defense in relation to these matters, unless the parties have otherwise agreed on the elements that these observations should address.  The parties shall submit with their observations all documents that they consider relevant to the matter or may refer to other documents and evidence that they intend to present.

**2.** The parties, unless they agree otherwise, may modify or supplement their claim or defense during the proceedings, unless the arbitral tribunal considers that there is no reason to allow such a modification due to the lateness of its submission.
