In arbitration proceedings involving more than one arbitrator, the arbitral tribunal shall issue a written decision by a majority vote, unless the parties agree otherwise. However, procedural matters may be decided by the presiding arbitrator if authorized by the parties or the other members of the tribunal.

If a majority is not reached, the presiding arbitrator shall issue the decision based on their opinion. In this case, the presiding arbitrator's signature suffices for the decision.
