The arbitral tribunal, upon the request of one of the parties, may authorize any provisional or conservatory measures it deems necessary, unless the parties agree otherwise.

If the party concerned does not comply with the aforementioned authorization, the arbitral tribunal may seek assistance from the First President of the Court of Appeal of Tunis in enforcing it.

In both cases, the arbitral tribunal or the judge may order any party to pay the advance costs incurred by such measures.
