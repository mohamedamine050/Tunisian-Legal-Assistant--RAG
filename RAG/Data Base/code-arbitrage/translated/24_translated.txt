If a time limit is set for the resolution of the dispute, the running of that time limit shall commence from the date of the arbitrator or the last arbitrator's acceptance of his/her assignment.

If no time limit is set, the dispute shall be resolved as soon as possible, and in any case within a period not exceeding six months.

However, the arbitration panel may, by decision, extend the arbitration time limit once or twice if the resolution of the dispute is impossible within the time limits mentioned in the preceding paragraphs. The decision to extend the time limit is not subject to any form of appeal. 

These time limits may be extended by agreement of the parties or in accordance with the arbitration rules.
