It is not considered contrary to the arbitration agreement for one of the parties to request from the judge of urgent matters, before or during the arbitration proceedings, to take a temporary precautionary measure. 

The judge of urgent matters, characterized by speed and simplicity of procedures, unlike substantive courts which are known for complex rules and lengthy procedures, may take a temporary measure based on this request.
