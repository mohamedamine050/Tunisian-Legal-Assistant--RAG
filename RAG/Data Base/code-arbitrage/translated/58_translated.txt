## English Translation:

**1.** The parties are free to agree on the procedure for challenging [**the arbitral award**]. This challenge must be based on conduct that incites or instigates hatred, disgust, contempt, or serious ridicule on account of the person's race or religion, taking into account the provisions of paragraph 3 of this chapter.

**2.** If no such agreement exists, the party intending to challenge [**the arbitral award**] on the basis of conduct that incites or instigates hatred, disgust, contempt, or serious ridicule on account of the person's race or religion, shall submit the grounds for the challenge in writing to the arbitral tribunal within fifteen days of the date on which they become aware of its composition or of any of the reasons referred to in paragraph 2 of Chapter 57 of this Code.

**3.** If the challenged arbitrator does not withdraw or if the other party does not agree to the request for a challenge [**of the arbitral award**] based on conduct that incites or instigates hatred, disgust, contempt, or serious ridicule on account of the person's race or religion, the request must specify, under penalty of nullity, the ground for the challenge, be accompanied by all relevant arguments, and be signed by the challenger or their authorized representative. The person challenging the award may then apply to the Court of Appeal in Tunis within forty-five days of the submission provided for in paragraph 2 above, for a decision on the challenge. The decision rendered on the merits of the challenge is not subject to any form of appeal, and pending this decision, the arbitral proceedings are suspended.

**4.** If the arbitral proceedings agreed upon by the parties assign the decision on the challenge to a specific institution, the Court shall decline to hear it.
