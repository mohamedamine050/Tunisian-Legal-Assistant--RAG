The arbitrator must be a natural person, of sound mind, competent, and enjoying full civil rights, and must be independent and impartial with respect to the parties. 

If the arbitration agreement designates a legal entity, the role of this entity is limited to appointing the individual most suitable for the position, considering the qualifications and competencies required to carry out the task.

With regard to public officials, it is further required that the task does not compromise the interests of the administration.
