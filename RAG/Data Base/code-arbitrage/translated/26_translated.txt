If a question arises before the arbitral tribunal concerning its jurisdiction over the dispute submitted to it, the tribunal shall decide on it by a ruling that is not subject to any form of appeal, except on the merits.

However, if the tribunal decides that it lacks jurisdiction, this decision shall be reasoned and subject to appeal.
