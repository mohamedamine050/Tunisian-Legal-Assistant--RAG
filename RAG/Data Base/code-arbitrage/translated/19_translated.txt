If a dispute is brought before the court, arising from a legal dispute between two parties, and it is established that the dispute is subject to an arbitration agreement, the court shall declare its lack of jurisdiction upon request from one of the parties. If the arbitral tribunal has not yet taken cognizance of the dispute, the court shall also declare its lack of jurisdiction unless the arbitration agreement is clearly invalid. In both cases, the court may not raise the issue of lack of jurisdiction on its own initiative. The urgent judge may take any measures within his jurisdiction as long as the arbitral tribunal has not commenced its proceedings. 

Once the arbitral tribunal has commenced its proceedings, the taking of any interim measures falls under its jurisdiction. 

The president of the Court of First Instance, within whose jurisdiction the place of arbitration is located, shall be responsible for giving the arbitral tribunal's interim or procedural decisions executive force.
