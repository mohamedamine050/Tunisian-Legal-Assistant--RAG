A person, when offered the possibility of being appointed as an arbitrator, must disclose all reasons that could reasonably raise doubts about their impartiality or independence. Upon their appointment, and as long as the arbitration proceedings are ongoing, they must promptly inform the parties of any such reason unless they have already informed them, giving the parties a reasonable time to respond and informing them that they will not accept the task or continue in it unless they explicitly agree. 

No grounds for challenging an arbitrator shall be admitted unless there are reasons that could reasonably raise doubts about their impartiality or independence, or if they do not possess the qualifications agreed upon by the parties. Similarly, no party to the dispute may challenge an arbitrator they have appointed or participated in appointing, except for reasons that emerge after the appointment.

An arbitrator may be challenged for the same reasons as a judge. 

Any challenge must clearly state the grounds for challenge, under penalty of nullity, and must be accompanied by all relevant supporting evidence. It must be signed by the challenger or their designated attorney and submitted to the court of first instance where the arbitration is seated, which shall hear the challenge in accordance with the provisions of the Civil and Commercial Code.
