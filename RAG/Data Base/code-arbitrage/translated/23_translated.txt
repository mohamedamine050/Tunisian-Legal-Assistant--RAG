An arbitration dispute does not terminate upon the death of a party or the dissolution of a legal entity.  Instead, the proceedings are suspended until the relevant parties are summoned to appear for judgment.

In the meantime, the deadline for deciding the dispute is suspended.

If the aforementioned summons is not issued, or if the relevant party does not declare their presence for judgment within a period of six months, the arbitration dispute shall terminate.
