If the competent court decides to admit the appeal, it shall rule on the annulment of the judgment or arbitration proceedings, in whole or in part, as the case may be. 

It shall rule on the subject matter of the dispute if requested by the parties. It shall have the power of the arbitrator if such power is vested in the arbitration tribunal. 

It may stay proceedings if the case is related to another case pending before another court.

However, if the court decides to reject the appeal, the judgment of rejection shall be deemed as an order to enforce the challenged arbitration award.
