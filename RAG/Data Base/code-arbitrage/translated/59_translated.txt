## English Translation:

1. If an arbitrator becomes legally or practically unable to perform their duties, or fails to do so within thirty days, their mandate terminates by their resignation or by agreement to terminate it. If there is a dispute regarding any of these reasons, either party may request the First President of the Court of Appeal of Tunis to decide on the matter of the arbitrator's dismissal by an urgent order, which shall be not subject to any form of appeal.

If the appointment of the arbitrator was made pursuant to the rules of an arbitration institution, the consideration of their dismissal shall be governed by the rules of that institution.

2. If an arbitrator resigns or a party agrees to terminate the arbitrator's mandate in accordance with this chapter or with paragraph 2 of chapter 58 of this Code, this shall not constitute an admission of the validity of any of the reasons referred to in this chapter or in paragraph 2 of chapter 57 of this Code.
