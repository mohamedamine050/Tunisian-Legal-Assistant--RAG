## English Translation:

1. Unless the parties agree otherwise, the arbitral tribunal shall decide whether to hold a public hearing or hearings conducted by the competent bodies, in accordance with the procedural rules set forth in this Guide, with the aim of obtaining specific information concerning the activities or operations carried out by the public administration, to ensure the soundness, integrity, transparency and consistency of performance with the requirements of the public interest. It shall hear the parties or limit itself to considering the matter based on the documents and papers submitted to it. Nevertheless, upon the request of one of the parties, it may hold a hearing at such time as it deems appropriate. 

2. The parties must receive, within a reasonable time, notice of the date of any procedural action taken by the arbitral tribunal. 

3. All written observations, documents, and information submitted by one party must be communicated to the other party.  Likewise, any report, form of information delivery, which is formulated in a semi-final manner for the purpose of future examination, testing, or any document that the arbitral tribunal may rely on in its award, must also be communicated to the parties.
