Arbitration can be either free or entrusted to an arbitration institution. 

In the case of free arbitration, the arbitration panel is responsible for organizing it by determining the procedures to be followed, unless the parties to the dispute agree otherwise or prefer to follow a specific arbitration system. 

In the case of arbitration before an arbitration institution, the institution is responsible for organizing it according to its own rules. 

In all cases, the basic principles of civil proceedings, particularly those related to the right of defense, are observed.
