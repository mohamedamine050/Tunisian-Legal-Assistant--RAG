Except as provided by law, a regional council may only be dissolved if other solutions are impossible, and by virtue of a reasoned government order issued after consulting the High Council of Local Authorities, and following the opinion of the Administrative Court. This dissolution must be based on serious breaches of the law or a clear disruption of the interests of the residents, after hearing the members of the council and granting them the right to defend themselves.

If confirmed, the Minister responsible for local authorities may suspend the councilâ€™s activities based on a reasoned report from the governor, after consulting the office of the High Council of Local Authorities, for a maximum period of two months. The mayor or one-third of the council members may appeal against the decisions of suspension or dissolution before the competent Administrative Court of First Instance. The parties concerned may request a stay of execution of the aforementioned decisions within five days of being notified of them. The president of the competent Administrative Court shall rule on the request for a stay of execution within ten days of the request being filed.

Decisions of suspension or dissolution shall not take effect until a decision refusing the request for a stay of execution by the president of the competent Administrative Court has been issued, or until the deadline for filing the request has passed. Throughout the suspension of the regional council, the executive director of the region shall manage the administration of the region. He may exceptionally authorize, upon instructions from the governor, any expenditure that cannot be postponed.
