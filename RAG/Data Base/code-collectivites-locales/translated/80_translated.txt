## English Translation:

The local community may manage its facilities directly or indirectly. Local communities conclude contracts whereby they entrust public or private entities with the management of public facilities or the fulfillment of a public need. The choice of methods for managing public facilities by local community councils is subject to a balancing process aimed at selecting the best method, considering the criteria of efficiency and quality, and taking into account the capabilities of the local community itself. The community council may seek advice from experts whom it deems competent in assessing the best method for managing the public facility and in selecting it.
