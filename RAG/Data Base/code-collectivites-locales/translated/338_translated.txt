If the head of the entity refuses or neglects to perform any of the duties assigned to him by law and regulations, the governor shall notify him in writing to complete what the law and regulations require. In the event that the head of the entity fails or is demonstrably unable to complete the required tasks despite the existence of a certain risk, the governor may exercise those powers himself or delegate them to a representative for that purpose, pursuant to a reasoned decision. The governorâ€™s intervention shall cease upon the removal of the aforementioned reasons.
