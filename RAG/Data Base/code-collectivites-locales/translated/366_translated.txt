The President or one of their Assistants may be suspended from their duties by a reasoned decision of the Minister in charge of local communities for a maximum period of three months, after consulting the Office of the Higher Council of Local Communities, and after hearing them or requesting them to provide written statements regarding any serious errors attributed to them that constitute a violation of the law and have caused significant harm to the public interest. Violations are described as follows:
* **Felonies** are crimes punishable by death or imprisonment exceeding five years.
* **Misdemeanors** are crimes punishable by imprisonment exceeding fifteen days but not exceeding five years, or by a fine exceeding sixty dinars.
* **Offenses** are crimes punishable by imprisonment not exceeding fifteen days or a fine of sixty dinars. 

The President or Assistant may be dismissed by a reasoned government order after hearing them and consulting the Office of the Higher Council of Local Communities, provided that their responsibility in the actions referred to in the first paragraph is established. 

The Office of the Higher Council of Local Communities shall provide its reasoned opinion within ten days from the date of receipt of the consultation from the Head of Government. 

Decisions to suspend or dismiss may be appealed before the competent Administrative Court. The interested parties may request a stay of execution of these decisions within five days of being notified of the decisions. The President of the competent Administrative Court shall rule on the request for stay of execution within ten days of its submission. 

Decisions to suspend or dismiss shall not take effect until a decision is issued rejecting the request for stay of execution by the President of the competent Administrative Court, or until the deadline for submitting the request has passed as stipulated in the previous paragraph of this section. 

Dismissal shall automatically prevent the President or Assistant from being elected for the remainder of the term, unless the dismissal order is annulled by the Administrative Court.
