## English Translation:

The Municipal Council shall be consulted and provide its opinion on every project intended to be implemented within the municipal area by the State, the Region, the Authority, or any public entity. It shall also provide its opinion in all cases required by the current legislation. The Municipal Council shall provide its opinion within a period of two months from the date of the submission of the matter to it for consultation.  

The absence of an opinion after the expiry of the aforementioned period, or the Municipal Council's objection, **does not** hinder the implementation of the planned projects.

**Objection** is a remedy available to the defaulting party in order to appeal a decision rendered in absentia.
