## English Translation:

Local communities initially manage public administrative facilities through direct exploitation. The local community may exploit these facilities through an agency arrangement. The agency's terms and expenses are formalized within the local community's budget, and a simplified accounting system, regulated by a government decree issued based on the opinion of the National Council for Public Accounting Standards and the opinion of the Administrative Court, is followed. 

The Administrative Court, being the supreme court that examines matters related to public administration, oversees this process. Public facilities are exploited according to principles of efficiency, quality, and preservation of public funds.
