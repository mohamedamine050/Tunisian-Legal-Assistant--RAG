The President of the Region, his assistants, and members of the Regional Council shall inform the Council of anything that could raise suspicion or doubts regarding potential conflicts of interest when managing the Region or exercising their powers. If the President's interests conflict with the Region's interests in a particular matter, the Regional Council shall appoint another member from among its members to follow up on the matter and represent the Region before the courts or to conclude contracts. The same procedure shall apply if the interests of a member of the Regional Council conflict with the interests of the Region.
