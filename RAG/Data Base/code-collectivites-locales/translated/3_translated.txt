## English Translation:

Local communities are established and their boundaries are regulated by law. The National Assembly approves by law the integration of local communities, which is approved by their elected councils with a two-thirds majority of their members. The process of integration results in the transfer of all obligations and rights to the community whose existence is established by law. The National Assembly approves by law the modification of the boundaries of local communities, which is approved by their elected councils with a two-thirds majority of their members. Disputes relating to the boundaries of local communities are brought before the Administrative Court, a court that adjudicates matters concerning public administration, in the territorial jurisdiction of the local community that filed the action, according to the procedures and deadlines established by the law governing administrative courts.
