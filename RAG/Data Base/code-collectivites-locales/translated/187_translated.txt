## English Translation:

**It is prohibited for the Treasurers to authorize the expenditure of budgets of local communities equipped with the information system dedicated to managing expenditures during the execution of the budget.** This prohibition applies to those delegated by the Treasurers of local communities to perform such tasks. **The use of manual procurement authorizations is also prohibited.**

**Any violation of this prohibition constitutes an offense.**  

* **Crimes** within the meaning of this law are those punishable by death or imprisonment exceeding five years.
* **Misdemeanors** are offenses punishable by imprisonment exceeding fifteen days but not exceeding five years or by a fine exceeding sixty dinars. 
* **Violations** are offenses punishable by imprisonment not exceeding fifteen days or by a fine not exceeding sixty dinars. (Article 122 of the Code of Criminal Procedure)

The provisions of this section regarding errors of conduct are subject to the provisions of the Organic Law of the Court of Auditors concerning errors of conduct. However, in the event of a proven malfunction of the information system that would jeopardize the interests of the local community or the smooth functioning of its facilities, temporary manual authorizations may be used pending a resolution as soon as the malfunctioning information system dedicated to managing expenditures is rectified.
