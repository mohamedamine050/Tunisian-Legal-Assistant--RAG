Members of local councils and local community officials have the right to training commensurate with their duties. Local communities collaborate with higher education institutions and training institutions to organize training programs for elected officials and staff. Local communities allocate funds for training that are proportional to the approved programs for this purpose, provided that they do not fall below 0.5 percent of the operating budget.
