## English Translation:

The local community accountant, acting under his personal responsibility, shall be responsible for the **collection** of funds.

**Collection** is the process by which a creditor obtains payment from his debtor for the financial debt contracted towards him.

The amounts and dues owed to the local community are set within the framework of annual collection targets agreed upon with the local community. The local community accountant shall direct a monthly statement that includes the collections made and the overdue debts that have matured and have not been collected.

Before the 31st of March of each year, the local community accountant shall submit a schedule of dues and amounts that are impossible to collect, along with the reasons and evidence for the impossibility of collection. The local community council, by a majority vote of two-thirds of its members, shall deliberate and authorize, when necessary, the accountant to cancel the debt from the list of overdue debts, except for debts related to tax revenue.
