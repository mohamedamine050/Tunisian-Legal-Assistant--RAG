Local communities, within the scope of their powers conferred upon them by law, may establish local public facilities or contribute to facilities with public participation for the purpose of exploiting public facilities with an industrial or commercial nature. For the purposes of this law, the term “local public facility” refers to any local public establishment or private limited company subject to the current legislation in which the local communities, individually or jointly, hold more than half of its capital.
