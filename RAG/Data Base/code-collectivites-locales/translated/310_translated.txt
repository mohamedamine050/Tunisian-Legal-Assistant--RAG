## English Translation:

The committees shall convene within a period not exceeding ten days from the date of their formation, upon the invitation of their respective presidents. They shall determine their meeting schedules and agendas. The committees shall prepare reports on the topics they undertake or those assigned to them by the Regional Council or the Head of the Region.

The committees shall adopt participatory democracy mechanisms. A committee may invite state officials, public institutions, or public establishments with expertise to participate in its work. The expertise shall cover scientific, technical, and other matters necessary for adjudicating the legal case, excluding legal issues. They may also invite residents, civil society components, or any individuals whose opinions may be beneficial based on their activity or experience.

The proceedings of the committees shall be recorded in a dedicated numbered register. A secure electronic record system may be adopted. The committees have no decision-making authority and cannot exercise any powers of the Regional Council, even if delegated by the latter.
