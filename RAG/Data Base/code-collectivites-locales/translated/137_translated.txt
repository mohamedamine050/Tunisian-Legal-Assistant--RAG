The budget of local communities is funded by the following resources:

* **Local taxes and fees** established by law for their benefit.
* **Taxes and contributions** allocated to their benefit by law.
* **Various fees, charges, and rights**, regardless of their designation, which do not constitute taxes or contributions within the meaning of Article 65 of the Constitution, and whose amounts or percentages are determined by the local communities through their elected councils in respect of exploitation, services, or licenses. 
* **Resources allocated by the central authority.**
* **The proceeds of other non-tax revenues**, including the proceeds of violations of regulations and decisions specific to each community, as well as the proceeds arising from local public agencies and institutions.
* **Donations.**
* **Borrowed funds.**
