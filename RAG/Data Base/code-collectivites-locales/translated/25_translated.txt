The local community enjoys regulatory authority exercised within its territorial jurisdiction and competence, taking into account the provisions of national legislative and regulatory texts. Decisions are classified into municipal, regional, and provincial decisions. Local communities, in exercising their powers, shall ensure coordination with other locally competent communities, and that local regulatory provisions are necessary and do not substantially infringe upon the principle of equality before the law and public service and guaranteed rights. For this purpose, they may consult the competent Administrative Court, which shall issue its opinion within a period not exceeding two months from the date of the request.
