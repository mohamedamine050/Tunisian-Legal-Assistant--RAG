The Head of the Region is responsible, within the scope of the law, for managing the Region's affairs, and is its legal representative. He may, by a decision published in the Official Gazette of Local Authorities, delegate part of his powers, excluding the signing of regulatory decisions, to his assistants or to a member of the Regional Council. The delegations remain in effect unless they are revoked.
