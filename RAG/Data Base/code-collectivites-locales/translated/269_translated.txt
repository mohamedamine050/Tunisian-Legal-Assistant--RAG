The Mayor of the Municipal Council is assisted in the management of the municipality's affairs by a Municipal Bureau, which, in addition to the Mayor, consists of the assistants, committee chairs, and department heads, as necessary. The Municipal Bureau meets at least once a month. It is chaired by the Mayor of the Municipal Council or his delegate in his absence, in accordance with the provisions of this law. The Secretary General of the municipality keeps minutes of the Bureau's deliberations under the same conditions applicable to the minutes of the Municipal Council. The minutes of the Bureau's deliberations are included in a numbered and signed register by the Mayor and the other members of the Municipal Council. These minutes are available for inspection.
