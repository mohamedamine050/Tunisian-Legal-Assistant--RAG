## English Translation:

The preparation of development and land-use planning programs shall be subject to participatory democracy mechanisms. The local council shall ensure the effective participation of all residents and civil society in all stages of the preparation, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of development and land-use planning programs. The local council shall take all necessary measures to inform residents and civil society in advance of development and land-use planning program projects. Projects for development and land-use planning programs shall be submitted for approval by the concerned local councils after fulfilling the procedures stipulated in this law. A model system for participatory democracy mechanisms shall be established by a government decree upon the proposal of the Higher Council of Local Councils. The elected local council, in consultation with civil society, shall determine the mechanisms and forms of participatory democracy based on the aforementioned model system. Local councils shall reject any development program that does not comply with the provisions of this chapter. Any decision taken by the local council in violation of the provisions of this chapter shall be subject to a legal challenge by way of an action for abuse of power. 

**Notes:**

* "**تجاوز السلطة**" has been translated as "**abuse of power**" which is a common legal term in English.
* "**دعوى**" has been translated as "**action**", which is the more formal legal term, but "**legal challenge**" was also used in the preceding sentence for better flow.
* "**جوبا**" is a legal term meaning "compulsorily" and has been translated as such.
*  The term "**مصادقة**" has been translated as "**approval**" instead of "**ratification**" to avoid confusion with the term's use in international treaties.
* "**متساكنين**" has been translated as "**residents**" to avoid the more informal "inhabitants".
* "**مجلس الجماعة المحلية**" has been translated as "**local council**" for consistency. 
*  "**مجلس الأعلى للجماعات المحلية**" has been translated as "**Higher Council of Local Councils**" to maintain clarity and avoid using "Supreme Council" which might imply greater authority.
