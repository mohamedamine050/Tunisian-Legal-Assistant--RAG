During their first session, the members of the Regional Council shall take the following oath, administered by the First President of the competent Court of Appeal or his delegate:

"I swear by Almighty God to devote myself to serving the interests of the region and all its residents without discrimination or favoritism, in the framework of respect for the Constitution, the laws, the values of democracy, and the unity of the Tunisian State." 

This oath is taken to confirm the truth of a statement or testimony. It is also taken by a party in a dispute, when they lack the legally required evidence to prove their claim, relying instead on the conscience, integrity, and religion of their opponent to resolve the dispute. This is known as an oath of veracity.
