## English Translation:

If it is determined from the results of the implementation of the budget for the ending year that the deficit exceeds five percent, the Supreme Council of Local Communities, at the request of the Minister of Finance, shall call upon the local community to take measures to settle the deficit through ordinary resources and inform the Council and the relevant central authorities within sixty days.  In the event of non-compliance by the local community, the central authority shall propose measures to be submitted to the **Court of Accounts**, which is a competent territorial court authorized, where necessary, to approve the necessary measures to settle the deficit.  This procedure shall be in effect until measures are taken to effectively settle the deficit through ordinary resources.

Local communities shall evaluate their interventions either through officials appointed by the Supreme Council of Local Communities at the suggestion of the High Commission for Local Finance, at the request of the community, or through auditors from among certified public accountants, and shall implement necessary adjustments to ensure proper management of public finances in light of the evaluation. 

The local community shall establish a unit for auditing and internal control.  Appeals shall be processed in accordance with the provisions of Article 94 of this law.
