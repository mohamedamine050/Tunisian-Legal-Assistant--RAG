The local community council shall approve the establishment of a local public facility, or its participation therein, or its participation in facilities with local public contributions, or its relinquishment of the majority in the capital of local public companies, which shall then become facilities with public contributions. The current legislation governing contributions and public facilities shall apply to local public facilities and facilities with public contributions, unless it conflicts with the principle of free management and the provisions of this law.
