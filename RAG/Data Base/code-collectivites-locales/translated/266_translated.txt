The Mayor is entrusted with municipal regulations, environmental police administration, and the implementation of the Municipal Council's decisions. The Mayor shall issue administrative regulations of a general nature, not pertaining to any specific person, concerning the cleanliness and health of the city, the preservation of its beauty, and the protection of the environment within the entire municipal area, including state-owned public property. Officials tasked with inspecting violations are required to inform the Mayor within three days of the inspection date. Municipal officials responsible for environmental police operate under the Mayor's responsibility, fulfilling their assigned duties as mandated by law. In case of non-compliance with decisions issued by the Mayor, the Governor shall authorize the execution of the decisions taken within the scope of municipal regulations. The Mayor shall be notified in writing of the outcome of the decisions within two months and provided with reasons for non-execution, if applicable. The central authority appoints a security contact for each Mayor. The Mayor has the right to appeal the central authority's refusal to execute municipal decisions before the Administrative Court. Failure to take or execute demolition decisions by those responsible constitutes a serious error warranting accountability.
