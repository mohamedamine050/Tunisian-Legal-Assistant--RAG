## English Translation:

Development expenditure authorizations are divided into commitment authorizations and payment authorizations. Commitment authorizations are at the disposal of the authorizing officer to enable him to commit the necessary expenses for the implementation of investments stipulated in the budget. Payment authorizations are used to issue payment orders for the amounts borne by the local community within the limits of commitment authorizations.
