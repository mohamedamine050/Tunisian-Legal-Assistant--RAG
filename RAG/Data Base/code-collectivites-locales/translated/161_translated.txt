## English Translation:

Local communities bear the rental expenses for all personnel seconded to them, in accordance with the law and the provisions of the personnel's statutes. The local community may also, to fill vacancies in certain positions, provide additional grants as a supplement to the salaries of personnel placed at its disposal by the state for a limited period, pursuant to agreements concluded for this purpose between the central administration and the local community, at the request of the public authority. The amount of the grant shall not exceed half of the personnel's salary and allowances borne by their original administration. The personnel seconded to the local community retains their rights in their original administration, including those related to the job classification they held at the time, if applicable. Priority in placement at the disposal of the state shall be given to its own personnel or to personnel of public institutions attached to it, for local communities that register a growth index below the national average and a staffing rate below the general staffing rate in local communities. The grants that may be awarded are determined by a governmental decree, based on the opinion of the 

**Supreme Administrative Court**, 

after 

**consultation** 

with the 

**Supreme Council of Local Communities**.
