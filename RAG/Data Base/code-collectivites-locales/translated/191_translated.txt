The National Council for Public Accounting Standards establishes the accounting system for local communities, which is based on the principles of double-entry bookkeeping and accrual accounting.  This accounting system is issued by a government decree.  It is amended, pursuant to the same procedure, based on the opinion of the **Supreme Administrative Court**.  Local communities are authorized to engage accounting professionals to maintain their accounts pursuant to an agreement approved by the local community council, according to a model prepared by the Supreme Council of Local Communities and published in the official gazette for local communities.
