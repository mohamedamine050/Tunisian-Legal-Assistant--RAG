The local community council may decide to exploit certain local public facilities in the form of an agency. A special budget is allocated to the agencies entrusted with managing local public facilities, and they follow the accounting rules applicable to institutions in this regard. The appointment of an auditor is made according to the criteria of competition and transparency, in accordance with general administrative decisions that are not specific to any particular person and the procedures in force for monitoring them. 

The administrative and financial organization of the agencies, their financial system, and their management methods are regulated by a government order proposed by the Minister responsible for Finance and the Minister responsible for local communities after consulting the Higher Council of Local Communities and based on the opinion of the Supreme Administrative Court.
