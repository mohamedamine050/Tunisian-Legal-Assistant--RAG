Taking into account the specific provisions relating to the voting on certain matters, decisions are taken by an absolute majority of the members present, provided that this majority is not less than one-third of the members of the Municipal Council. Voting by proxy is not permitted. Voting shall be conducted openly. If the votes are equal, the vote of the President shall be decisive. The names of the voters shall be recorded in the minutes of the meeting. Secret balloting shall be conducted in one of the following two cases:

* If at least one-third of the members of the Council present request it and the Council approves the proposal by a two-thirds majority of its members present; 
* If the Council is called upon to elect or to decide on the nomination or submission of candidacies. In this case, if no candidate obtains a majority of the votes of those present in the first round, a second round shall be held in which the two candidates who obtained the highest number of votes in the first round shall participate. If the votes are equal in the second round, the younger candidate shall be declared the winner.
