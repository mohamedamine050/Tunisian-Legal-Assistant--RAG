The Municipal Council shall meet at the municipality's headquarters. However, for objective reasons, meetings may be held at another location within the municipality, provided that it meets the requirements of accessibility, security, and ensures the public character of the meeting and the principle of neutrality. In the event of the election of a Municipal Council following the creation of a municipality or the dissolution of a Municipal Council, the first meeting shall be convened by the competent provincial governor. During the first meeting, the members of the Municipal Council shall deposit their chosen addresses and their electronic addresses, if available.
