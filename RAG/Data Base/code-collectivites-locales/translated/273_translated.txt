Municipal employees are employed at the expense of their respective municipal budgets. The central authority may assign public employees to municipalities, with their salaries continuing to be paid by their original administration. The central authority may also, upon request from municipalities, assign public employees or employees belonging to public institutions and establishments to these municipalities.
