The Regional President is responsible, within the scope of the law, for managing the affairs of the region, and is its legal representative. He may, by a decision published in the Official Gazette of Local Authorities, delegate part of his powers, except for signing regulatory decisions, to his assistants or to a member of the Regional Council. Delegations remain in effect unless terminated.
