## English Translation:

Local communities are obligated to control the amount of public rental expenditures, ensuring they do not exceed a ceiling of fifty percent of the regular resources generated from their budgets. Local communities exceeding this rental expenditure ceiling, as mentioned in the preceding paragraph, must submit a program for controlling rental expenditures to the High Council for Local Finance and the central authority. 

This program shall be implemented pursuant to an agreement concluded for this purpose between the concerned local community and the central authority. The conditions for the application of this provision and its procedures shall be established by a government decree proposed by the High Council for Local Finance, based on the opinion of the Supreme Council of Local Communities and the opinion of the **Supreme Administrative Court**, a court that hears matters related to public administration.
