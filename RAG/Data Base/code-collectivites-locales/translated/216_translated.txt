## English Translation:

The first session of the elected municipal council shall be convened no later than eight working days from the date of the proclamation of the final election results by the Independent High Electoral Commission. This convocation shall be by invitation from the outgoing mayor or, in the event of his/her inability, by the oldest member of the elected council. The council shall, in its first meeting, set the dates for its regular sessions and notify the public accordingly.

A preparatory session shall precede the regular session of the council. This preparatory session shall be convened at least one month prior to the date of the regular session under the supervision of the mayor or his/her designated deputy. Residents of the municipal area shall be invited through available media channels to participate and provide input on local matters and to be informed of the municipal programs. Proposals presented during the preparatory session shall be examined by the municipal committees according to their scope and shall be submitted to the subsequent regular session of the municipal council.

Sessions shall be held alternately in the different municipal districts.  Taking into account exceptional circumstances or official holidays, **the municipal council shall convene a public session during the weekend**. 

**Public sessions shall be held by civil society organizations, in accordance with the procedural rules outlined in this guide, with the aim of obtaining specific information regarding the works or activities undertaken by the public administration.** This is to ensure the soundness, integrity, transparency, and alignment of these works and activities with the requirements of the public interest.

The municipal council shall hold a regular session every three months. The council shall also convene meetings whenever necessary, by invitation from its president, at the request of one-third of its members, or at the request of one-tenth of the voters registered in the municipal electoral register. Invitations shall be sent at least 15 days prior to the date of the council meeting. However, the deadline can be shortened to two days in case of urgency, and in case of extreme urgency, the council shall meet immediately. 

The invitation shall necessarily include the matters to be discussed on the agenda. It shall be recorded in the minutes, posted at the entrance of the municipal headquarters, and published on the designated website. The invitation shall also be sent in writing to the members of the municipal council. Invitations sent by email shall be considered legally valid upon proof of receipt.
