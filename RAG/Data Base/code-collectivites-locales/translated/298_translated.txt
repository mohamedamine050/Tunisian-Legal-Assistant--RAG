The Regional Authority exercises the powers that can be devolved to it by the Central Authority, particularly in the following areas:

- Maintenance and development of public infrastructure, buildings, equipment, and facilities with regional impact.
- Support for agricultural, industrial, commercial, and investment activities within the region.

Any transfer of power is obligatorily coupled with the transfer of the necessary financial and human resources for its exercise.
