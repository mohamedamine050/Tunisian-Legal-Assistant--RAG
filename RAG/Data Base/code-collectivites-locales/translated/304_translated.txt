Each member of the Regional Council who, without a legitimate excuse, refrains from performing the duties entrusted to him by law shall be notified in writing by the Head of the Region to perform his duties. In the event of his failure to comply, the Regional Council may, after hearing him, dismiss him from his duties by a majority of three-fifths of its members. The concerned party may appeal to the Administrative Court [** محكمة تنظر في الأمور المتعلقة بالإدارة العامة **] having territorial jurisdiction.

Any member of the Regional Council who loses his status as an elector or is subject to a case of incompatibility pursuant to the provisions of the Electoral Law shall lose his membership in the Council by virtue of the law. The Regional Council shall declare this during its first meeting.
