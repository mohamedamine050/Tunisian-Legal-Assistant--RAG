The establishment and delimitation of the region are governed by law in accordance with the provisions of Article 3 of this law. This law recognizes the regions previously established within their territorial limits before its date and included in Annex "B" accompanying this law. The name, headquarters, or boundaries of a region may be changed by law, following the same procedures adopted for its establishment, based on a deliberation of the Regional Council by a two-thirds majority of its members.
