Local communities allocate budget funds annually, categorized by tasks and programs, to implement development and planning schemes. They consider mandatory expenses, the need for social justice, and gender equality based on available statistical data.  

These tasks encompass a range of programs aligned with national, regional, or local plans. The classification of tasks and programs is regulated by a government decree issued upon the recommendation of the Higher Council of Local Communities and the opinion of the **Administrative Court**, a court responsible for matters pertaining to public administration.

Local communities prioritize the evaluation of their budget implementation in relation to the achievement of development and planning objectives. This evaluation is conducted by qualified auditors at least every three years, with the results being published on the relevant local community's website.
