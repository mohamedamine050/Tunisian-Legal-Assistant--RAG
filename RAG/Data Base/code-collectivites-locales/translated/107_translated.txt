Local communities, with the aim of developing economic activities with high employment capacity or high added value within their territorial jurisdiction, may grant direct or indirect assistance to economic institutions. This assistance is granted by the councils of local communities upon deliberation by a majority of three-fifths of their members, in accordance with the law and the requirements of transparency, competition, equal opportunities, sound use of public funds, and the international obligations of the Republic of Tunisia. Direct assistance takes the form of grants or financial loans without interest or on favorable terms, or the provision of premises or real estate to investors. Indirect assistance takes the form of contracts for leasing or disposal of real estate at differential prices concluded with the relevant economic and social institutions. In determining the financial consideration for these contracts, the reference prices determined by the real estate market in the region are taken into account, with discounts being granted as required by the expected economic and social benefits of these contracts. Guarantees to be provided by economic institutions applying for assistance and the amount of assistance are determined by a deliberation of the councils of local communities, taking into account the specific nature of each economic activity. The consequences of non-compliance by the local community's contracts with its obligations under the current legislation and contractual provisions are governed by the applicable rules.
