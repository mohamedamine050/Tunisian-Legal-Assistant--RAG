## English Translation:

Regional regulatory decisions shall enter into force five days after their publication on the official website of the local authorities' gazette. The region is obligated to post a summary of the deliberations and a copy of the regulatory decisions at its headquarters. The regional treasurer shall be informed of decisions with financial implications and contracts concluded with the region within ten days of their adoption.

Contrary to the provisions of Article 46 of this law, the regional council may, in case of certainty, decide by a majority of three-fifths of its members that a regulatory decision shall take effect upon its posting and deposit with the governor, and notification to the public by any available means, provided that it is subsequently published on the official website of the local authorities' gazette.
