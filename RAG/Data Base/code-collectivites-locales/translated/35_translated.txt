## English Translation:

Municipal and regional councils may, by a majority of their members, decide to organize public meetings with residents, during which the council shall provide clarifications and residents may offer proposals. This applies particularly before taking the following decisions:

* Reviewing local regulations,
* Entering into cooperation and partnership agreements,
* Contributing to the establishment of public facilities,
* Conclude cooperation agreements with central authorities,
* Entrusting another local authority with powers related to the municipality or accepting the responsibility of powers belonging to another local authority,
* Disposing of public property,
* Regulatory decisions of local councils,
* Partnership and external cooperation agreements,
* Financing associations and managing donations.

Furthermore, a session may be organized upon the submission of a reasoned request by at least 5% of the registered voters in the municipality or region. In this case, the local authority shall organize the session within a maximum period of thirty days from the date of the request submission.
