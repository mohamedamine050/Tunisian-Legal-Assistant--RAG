## English Translation:

The committees shall meet within a period not exceeding ten days from the date of their formation, upon the invitation of their presidents. They shall set their meeting schedules and agendas. Committees prepare reports on matters entrusted to them or referred to them by the municipal council or the mayor.

Committees adopt participatory democratic mechanisms. A committee may invite state officials, institutions, or public establishments with expertise to participate in its work. Expertise refers to scientific and technical matters, and other matters necessary for deciding a legal case, excluding legal issues. It may also invite residents, civil society components, or any individuals whose opinions may be beneficial based on their activities or expertise.

The proceedings of the committees shall be recorded in a special numbered register. A secure electronic registration system may be adopted. Committees do not have decision-making authority, and they cannot exercise any powers belonging to the municipal council, even if delegated by it.
