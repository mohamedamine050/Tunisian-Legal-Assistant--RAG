The Governor, either on his own initiative or at the request of any interested party, may challenge the decisions taken by the municipality. The Governor shall notify the Mayor of the municipality with a copy of the petition contesting the decision three days before filing it with the Court in writing. The Governor, if convinced, may request the suspension of the execution of the municipal decision. If the municipal decision is likely to infringe upon public or individual liberties, the President of the Administrative Court of First Instance shall authorize the suspension of execution within five days, at the request of the Governor or any interested party. The provisions of this section shall not preclude any natural or legal person from directly appealing to the Administrative Court of First Instance to challenge municipal decisions that have affected them.
