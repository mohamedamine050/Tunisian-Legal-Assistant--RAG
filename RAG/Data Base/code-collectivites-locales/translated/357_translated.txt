## English Translation:

The region is governed by a Regional Council elected by the members of the Municipal Councils.

**Municipal Councils** are local communities endowed with legal personality, administrative and financial autonomy. They manage municipal affairs according to the principle of free administration and work to develop the region economically, socially, culturally, environmentally, and urbanistically. They provide services to their constituencies, listen to the concerns of their residents, and engage them in the management of local and regional affairs in accordance with the law.

The Regional Council meets regularly every three months at the call of its President. It may also convene whenever necessary. Meetings of the Regional Council are considered legal when a majority of its members are present.

Meetings of the Regional Council are held at its headquarters. The Council may decide to meet at any other location within the region or, exceptionally, outside of it.

Meetings of the Regional Council are public. The Council may decide by a two-thirds majority of its members present to make the meeting confidential if at least one-third of its members present request it.

The Regional Council may summon anyone it deems useful to hear.
