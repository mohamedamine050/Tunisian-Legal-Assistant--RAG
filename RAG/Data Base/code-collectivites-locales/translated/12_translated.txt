A local community may delegate the exercise of one of its inherent powers to another local community, institutions, or public facilities. The delegation is done through a decision approved by an absolute majority of the members of the council of the concerned community. The decision shall specify the financial consequences resulting from the delegation. The powers are exercised by the delegated community on behalf of the original community entrusting the delegation. The delegation is made pursuant to a time-bound agreement in accordance with a model set by a governmental order issued based on the opinion of the Higher Council of Local Communities and the opinion of the Administrative Court.
