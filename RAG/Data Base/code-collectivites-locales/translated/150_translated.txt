The resources of the Decentralization, Amendment, and Solidarity Support Fund are allocated among local communities according to objective criteria, taking into consideration in particular: population, unemployment rate, tax capacity, development index, and debt capacity.  Additional resources may be allocated to cover specific burdens of certain local communities. 

The application of the allocation criteria is regulated by a government decree, proposed by the Higher Council of Local Communities, and based on the opinion of the Administrative Court, the highest court in the country, which hears matters related to public administration.  

In exceptional cases or in the event of disasters, the State may transfer advances or grants to local communities to assist them in facing emergencies.
