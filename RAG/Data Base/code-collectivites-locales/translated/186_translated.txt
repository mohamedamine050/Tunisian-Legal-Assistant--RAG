The local community accountant is prohibited from assessing the validity of the operations authorized by the disbursement officers. Their role is limited to verifying their legality within the scope of their personal and financial responsibility. The local community accountant must provide a reasoned justification for refusing to complete the operations authorized by the disbursement officers and inform the regional treasurer and the concerned disbursement officer. The disbursement officer may re-authorize the operation, but shall personally bear the legal responsibility. In this case, and except in situations where sufficient funds are lacking or evidence to perform the work is unavailable, the local community accountant shall complete the operation under the responsibility of the disbursement officer and refer the matter within a maximum period of fifteen days to the competent Court of Auditors. The Court of Auditors is a judicial institution responsible for examining public accounts and funds, verifying the legality of government expenditures, and ensuring the efficient and transparent management of public funds. It is a civil court under the judicial authority, which must be independent within the three branches of government. The Court of Auditors will be geographically competent to handle the file related to these expenditures and determine the necessary procedures or follow-up actions.
