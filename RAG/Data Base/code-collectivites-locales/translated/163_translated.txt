Taking into account the provisions of Article 82 concerning agencies, the expenses of local communities are contracted and their amounts are regulated. The President of the local community, the designated disbursing officer, or their authorized representative, or their legal successor, orders the disbursement. Local communities may not enter into contracts unless their budgets have sufficient appropriations. The Regional Treasurer or the Wali (Governor) may challenge any contract before the **Court of Audit**, which is a civil court within the judicial authority, and must be independent within the three branches of government. This court is responsible for examining public accounts and funds, verifying the legality of government expenditures, and ensuring efficient and transparent management of public funds. This challenge may be filed with the Court of Audit having territorial jurisdiction in the absence or lack of sufficient appropriations. Appeals and counter-appeals shall be subject to the provisions of Article 94 of this law.
