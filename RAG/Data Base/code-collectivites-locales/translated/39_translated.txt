## English Translation:

The allocations designated for settlement and adjustment are distributed with the aim of mitigating disparities between various local communities and enhancing the living conditions of their residents, based on the principle of positive discrimination. Pursuant to the criteria established by this law, the conditions for implementing the distribution of settlement and adjustment allocations are determined by a government order, based on a proposal from the Supreme Council of Local Communities, and after obtaining the opinion of the **Administrative Court**, a court that adjudicates matters related to public administration at the highest level. The aforementioned criteria are updated whenever necessary.
