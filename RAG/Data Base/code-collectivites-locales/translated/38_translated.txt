In pursuit of solidarity among the various components of the national territory, the State undertakes to assist local communities in achieving financial balance and actual administrative and financial independence through the allocation of investments and the transfer of adjustment credits specifically granted by the "Fund for Supporting Decentralization, Adjustment and Solidarity Between Local Communities", funded by the State budget.  

Starting from the year following the issuance of this law, credits are allocated under the heading of settlement and adjustment, allocated based on a program to achieve financial balance and good governance prepared by the concerned local community. The Supreme Council of Local Communities determines each year the list of local communities eligible for the financial balance program based on the data available to the body.
