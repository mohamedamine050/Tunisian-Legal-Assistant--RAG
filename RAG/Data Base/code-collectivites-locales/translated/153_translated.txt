Local communities are committed to monitoring the collection of dues, contributions, and receivables of all types. They urge debtors and coordinate with the local community accountant to notify them by legal means. The head of the local community concerned urges the public accountant to follow up on the collection of the principal debt and late penalties, in accordance with the current legislation governing public debts. The accountant informs the head of the local community at the end of each month of the status of collection follow-up for the past month.
