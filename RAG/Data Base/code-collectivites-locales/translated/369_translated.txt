The Regional President, their assistants, and the members of the Regional Council shall inform the Council of any matter that may raise suspicion or doubts about potential conflicts of interest in the administration of the region or the exercise of its powers. If the interests of the Regional President conflict with the interests of the region in a particular matter, the Regional Council shall appoint another member from amongst its members to follow up on the matter and represent the region before the courts or to enter into contracts. The same procedure shall be followed if the interests of a member of the Regional Council conflict with the interests of the region.
