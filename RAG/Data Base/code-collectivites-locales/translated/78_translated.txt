The local community, pursuant to a request from civil society organizations, shall establish a committee, in a formal manner, to bring together individuals with relevant expertise from various parts of the institution. This committee shall comprise, in addition to members of the council and its administration, representatives of civil society organizations to monitor the operation of public utilities without interfering in their management. This committee shall submit reports to the local community council. The local community may also inquire from users of a local public utility concerning the operation of the utility and its management through a questionnaire, ensuring that its formulation and the analysis of its results comply with the requirements of transparency, objectivity, and independence. The results of the survey shall be published through all available means.
