The State undertakes to establish national information networking systems to effectively manage the resources and assets of all local communities, for the purpose of updating real estate and activity inventories, in order to ensure the collection of taxes, various dues, fees, and local contributions. This is done to monitor the evolution of expenditures and resources and make them available to the High Council of Local Finance, in order to facilitate the exercise of its powers and assist in setting public policies. Local communities are committed to adopting and participating in these networks.
