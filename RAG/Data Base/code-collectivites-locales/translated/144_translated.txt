The State undertakes to transfer the management of parts of its public or private property to local communities. This transfer is regulated by a government decree based on the opinion of the Supreme Administrative Court.  The decree will define the terms of transfer, its procedures, and mechanisms for sharing burdens and resources arising from the exploitation of the transferred property. 

The State will transfer the management of parts of its public or private property to local communities through special agreements.  The State may terminate any agreement concerning the management of public or private property if it is proven that the local community is not effectively managing it.
