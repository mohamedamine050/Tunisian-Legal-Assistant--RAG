The Local Community Council enjoys the primary jurisdiction to exercise the regulatory power of local communities. The Council may delegate part of its regulatory powers to its President by a reasoned decision published in the Official Gazette of Local Communities. The delegation remains in effect unless terminated. The Local Community Council also exercises the regulatory powers granted to it by law or by regulatory texts issued by the central authorities.
