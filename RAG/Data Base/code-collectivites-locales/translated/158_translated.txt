## English Translation:

**Commitment credits shall remain in effect without any time limit.** They may be transferred from one year to another or cancelled when necessary.  **Payment credits that are not used within one year of the implementation of the budget shall be cancelled and cannot be postponed.**

However, the remaining balance of payment credits may be transferred and reopened under the heading of the following year, within the limits of the funds actually available under the same program.  If necessary, they may be reprogrammed, taking into account the allocated resources, to fund other specific projects, including covering the costs of maintenance and improvement of local community buildings and facilities, and supporting libraries.  **The Regional Treasurer shall be informed of the decision to reopen unused payment credits.**
