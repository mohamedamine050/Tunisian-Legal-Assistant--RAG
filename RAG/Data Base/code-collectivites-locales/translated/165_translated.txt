## English Translation:

Residents of the local community and registered civil society organizations with the General Secretariat, as well as any individual with a legitimate interest, may submit a written request for clarification to the President of the local community regarding specific revenues and expenses. Each request shall be registered in a numbered register dedicated to inquiries. For this purpose, a secure electronic registration system may be employed.

Individuals referred to in the preceding paragraph who do not receive a response within a maximum period of one month from the date of submitting their request may refer the matter to the administratively competent court. The court may, if necessary, authorize the obtaining of the required documents.
