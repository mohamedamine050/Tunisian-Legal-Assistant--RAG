The Secretary General, or whoever performs his duties, is entrusted under the authority of the Mayor with the management of the municipal administration and the provision of advice to the municipal councils and their subsidiary bodies. The Secretary General attends the meetings of the Municipal Council, expresses his opinion, and submits proposals on the matters under consideration, without having the right to vote. The categories and conditions for the appointment of a Municipal Secretary General are regulated by a governmental decree based on the opinion of the **Supreme Administrative Court**. 

**Note:**

*  "محكمة الإدارية العليا" has been translated as "Supreme Administrative Court" as it is the highest court in the administrative jurisdiction. This reflects its role in providing legal opinions on appointments. 
*  The repetition of "المحكمة الإدارية" has been addressed by providing a definition within the text to clarify its role.
*  The French text has been omitted as it is not relevant to the legal context.
