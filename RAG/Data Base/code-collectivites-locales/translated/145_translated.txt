## English Translation:

Local communities propose to the competent central authority a review of the fees for the occupation of public domain belonging to the state within their jurisdictions. This proposal is based on the data available to them, enabling the most efficient use of the public domain. The environmental impacts are to be considered in setting the annual fee for exploiting sections and various properties, including those belonging to private individuals, in accordance with the principle of imposing a fair burden on those who cause pollution.
