If the Mayor refuses or neglects to perform any act assigned to him by law and regulations, the Governor shall notify him in writing to complete what is required by law and regulations. In the event that the Mayor fails or is demonstrably unable to complete the required tasks despite the presence of a certain danger, the Governor may exercise these powers himself or delegate them to a representative for this purpose, by a reasoned decision. The Governor's intervention shall cease upon the elimination of the aforementioned reasons.
