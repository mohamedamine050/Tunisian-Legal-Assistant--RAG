The Mayor, his assistants, and the members of the Municipal Council shall inform the Council of any matter that may raise suspicion or doubt concerning potential conflicts of interest in the administration of the municipality or in the exercise of its powers. If the interests of the Mayor conflict with the interests of the municipality in a specific file, the Municipal Council shall appoint another member from amongst its members to follow up on the file and represent the municipality before the courts or for the purpose of concluding contracts. The same procedure shall apply if the interests of a member of the Council conflict with the interests of the municipality.
