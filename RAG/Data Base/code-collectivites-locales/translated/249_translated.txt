The presidents of the municipal councils, being local communities with legal personality, administrative and financial autonomy, are responsible for managing municipal affairs in accordance with the principle of free administration. They strive to develop the region economically, socially, culturally, environmentally, and urbanistically, providing services to their constituents, listening to the concerns of their residents, and engaging them in the management of local affairs.

The assistants hold their positions for the same parliamentary term as the councils. In the event of the re-election of a new president of a municipal council, new assistants are elected.
