The State gradually assumes responsibility, through finance laws and tax laws, for the funds it collects in the form of taxes. Tax is a cash amount paid by individuals and companies in proportion to their income or profits.

Further, through laws related to property, the State aims to make self-generated resources represent the most significant portion of the resources of each local community. The central authority commits to assisting local communities in achieving equity between resources and burdens. To this end, the State allocates, within the framework of finance laws, credits for the benefit of local communities based on their funding needs.
