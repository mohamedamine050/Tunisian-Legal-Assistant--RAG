If the local community council refuses to approve the financial statement and administrative report, the documents shall be submitted to the **Court of Audit**, the competent court in terms of territorial jurisdiction, which shall decide on their approval or correction by the local community, as the case may be. 

The **Court of Audit** is a judicial institution tasked with examining public accounts and funds, verifying the legality of government expenditures, and ensuring the efficient and transparent management of public funds.

It is a civil court that is part of the judicial authority and must be independent within the three branches of government.

The local community council may not consider the draft budget for the following year before the closing of the previous year's budget except with the authorization of the **Court of Audit**, the competent court in terms of territorial jurisdiction.
