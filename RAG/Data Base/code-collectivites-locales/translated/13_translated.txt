Under the law, local communities possess inherent powers that they exercise exclusively, as well as delegated powers from the central authority.  Local communities also enjoy joint powers with the central authority, which they exercise in coordination and cooperation with the central authority based on sound public finance management and the improved delivery of services. The terms and procedures for implementing joint powers are regulated by law after consultation with the Supreme Council of Local Communities.
