The local development plan, prepared through a participatory approach and supported by state entities, serves as a reference framework for defining the program and interventions of local communities and their affiliated structures in the comprehensive development field. In developing the local development plan, the local community's capacities, the financial support provided by the state, and the various stakeholders involved in the development field, regardless of their designation, shall be considered. Supported by the state, the local development plan aims to support the unique characteristics of each local community or to enhance its attributes to accelerate its development and stimulate investment in it.
