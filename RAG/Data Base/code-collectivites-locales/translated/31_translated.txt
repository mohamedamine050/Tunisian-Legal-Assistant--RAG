The local community council, upon the initiative of the council president or one-third of the council members, may decide to hold a referendum among the residents regarding the preparation of development and territorial planning programs, with the approval of a two-thirds majority of the council members. 

Furthermore, one-tenth of the local voters in the local community council may initiate a proposal to hold a referendum. In this case, the referendum can be held if a two-thirds majority of the local council members approve it within a period not exceeding two months. 

No more than one referendum may be held during a municipal or regional electoral term. The local community council must adhere to the deadlines for preparing the budget when setting the date for the referendum. 

A referendum cannot be held during the first year following the election of the local council or during the last year of the municipal or regional electoral term.
