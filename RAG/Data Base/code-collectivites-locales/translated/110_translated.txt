## English Translation:

Local communities, within the framework of encouraging employment and creating projects, and within the scope of their territorial jurisdiction, may enter into agreements with the state to define their intervention plan and the assistance they provide to promote employment. These agreements shall be taken into account when preparing the draft budget of the concerned local community, by allocating financial appropriations for this purpose. The draft agreements referred to in the first paragraph of this chapter shall be submitted to the councils of the local communities for approval by a majority of those present, provided that the majority is no less than one-third of the members.
