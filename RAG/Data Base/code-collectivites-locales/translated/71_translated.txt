## English Translation:

Public local property cannot be forfeited, nor can its ownership be extinguished by lapse of time. It cannot be subject to acquisition by adverse possession, and the provisions concerning possession do not apply to it.

However, ownership may be transferred by mutual agreement and without prior approval from other public entities, provided that the purpose is to allocate the property for the exercise of the powers of the public entity transferring the ownership and its integration within its public domain.

The removal of property from the public domain of a local community is permissible only by a resolution passed by the Community Council with a three-fifths majority of its members.
