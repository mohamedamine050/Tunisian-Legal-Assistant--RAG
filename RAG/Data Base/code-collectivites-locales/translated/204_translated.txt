Except as provided by law, a municipal council may be dissolved only if other solutions are impossible, by a reasoned government order, following consultation with the High Council of Local Communities and based on the opinion of the Administrative Court. This shall be for reasons related to a serious breach of the law or a clear disruption of the interests of the residents, after hearing the council members and giving them the right to defend themselves. 

If confirmed, the Minister responsible for local communities may suspend the council from its activities based on a reasoned report from the Governor following consultation with the Secretariat of the High Council of Local Communities, for a maximum period of two months. The mayor of the municipality or one-third of the council members may appeal the suspension or dissolution decisions before the competent Court of First Instance. The interested parties may request the suspension of the execution of the decisions within five days of being notified of them. The President of the competent Administrative Court shall rule on the request for suspension of execution within ten days of the filing of the request.

The suspension or dissolution decisions shall not become effective until a decision is issued rejecting the President of the competent Administrative Court's request for suspension of execution or upon the expiry of the deadline for filing the request. During the suspension of the municipal council, the secretary general of the municipality shall manage the administration of the municipality. Exceptionally, upon a delegation from the Governor, expenditures that cannot be delayed may be authorized.
