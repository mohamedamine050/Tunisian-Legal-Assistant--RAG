## English Translation:

Extensions to public service concession contracts may only be granted by a reasoned decision adopted by a majority of the members of the granting municipality council.  Extensions are permitted in the following instances:

*  **At the request of the grantor**, for reasons related to the proper functioning of the public service or to expand its geographical scope, or to implement material investments not included in the original contract. 
*  **At the request of the grantor**, for reasons deemed necessary for the vital public interest of the locality.
*  **At the request of the concessionaire**, for reasons related to the proper functioning of the public service, or in the event of unforeseen circumstances resulting in delays in execution.

In all cases, an addendum to the original contract shall be executed.
