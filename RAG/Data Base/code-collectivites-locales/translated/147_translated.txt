Any expansion of the jurisdictions of local communities or the transfer of new jurisdictions to their benefit shall be accompanied by a mandatory strengthening of local resources, as stipulated by law. The resources transferred to local communities must be commensurate with the burdens arising from the transfer or expansion of jurisdictions. The High Commission for Local Finance, or any entity entrusted by it, shall be responsible for assessing the burdens arising from the transfer or expansion of jurisdictions during the first three years of their implementation. It shall, as necessary, present proposals to the Government, the House of Representatives, and the High Council of Local Communities to make the necessary amendments to ensure the proper alignment between burdens and resources.
