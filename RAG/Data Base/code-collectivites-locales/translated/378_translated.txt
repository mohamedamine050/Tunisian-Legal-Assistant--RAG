The Executive Director, or whoever assumes his duties, is entrusted under the authority of the Head of the Region with the management of the Regional Administration and the provision of advice to the Regional Council and its constituent bodies. The Executive Director attends the sessions of the Regional Council, expresses his opinion, and presents his proposals on the topics discussed, without having the right to vote. The terms and procedures for appointment, hiring, transfer, and dismissal of the Regional Executive Director are governed by a Government Decree, based on the opinion of the **Administrative Court**, which is the **highest court** reviewing matters related to public administration.
