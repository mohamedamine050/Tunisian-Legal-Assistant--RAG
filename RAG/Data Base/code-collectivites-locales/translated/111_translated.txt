## English Translation:

Local communities, based on programs determined by their Councils, may grant financial assistance to associations established in accordance with the law to support their social, cultural, sports, and environmental activities. They may also allow these associations to utilize various spaces and facilities for activities of public benefit, in accordance with programs and conditions approved by the local community and published on its website.  

Support provided to associations shall be based on the principles of transparency, equal opportunities, and competition. The Council of the local community, through a deliberation for this purpose, shall publicly announce, by all available means, the requirements for submitting applications for support, the criteria for selection, and the method for announcing the results of the selection process. Applications for support must be accompanied by a copy of the association's bylaws and the latest audited financial and activity reports.

The local community may grant funding for activities deemed important by its Council based on a "contract-program" concluded between the local community and the associations whose financial accounts are audited in accordance with the law. The activity program subject to the contract shall be published on the concerned local community's website.

Support provided by local communities to sports associations is subject to the law regulating sports structures.  Local communities shall publish, before the 15th of November each year, a report that includes a list of the associations benefiting from support during that year, along with a summary of their activities.
