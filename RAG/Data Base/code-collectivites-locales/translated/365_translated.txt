The resignation of the regional president or his assistants is submitted to the members of the Regional Council, which must convene within a period not exceeding fifteen days to deliberate on it. If the resignation is accepted, or if the resigning individuals refuse to withdraw it, the Governor and the Regional Treasurer, whose jurisdiction includes the seat of the region, are informed of the vacancy. The resigning officials continue to perform their duties until the date of installation of their successors. In the event that the resigned president confirms his resignation or refuses to continue managing the affairs of the region, the oldest member of the Regional Council undertakes to manage the affairs of the region with the assistance of the executive director.
