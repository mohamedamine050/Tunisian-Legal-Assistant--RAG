**Please note:** The translation maintains the legal terminology while streamlining the sentence structure for readability.  The translation avoids special characters unless part of official terms.  The translation consistently uses "not subject to any form of appeal" for "غير قابلة لأي وجه من أوجه الطعن" and avoids translating the irrelevant French text.
