The Governor, upon his own initiative or at the request of any interested party, may challenge decisions made by the administrative body. The Governor shall notify the head of the administrative body of his appeal three days prior to filing it in writing with the court.  The Governor may request the suspension of the administrative body's decision if he is certain of its illegality. If the administrative body's decision threatens public or individual freedoms, the presiding judge of the Administrative Court of First Instance may authorize the suspension of its execution within five days, upon the request of the Governor or any interested party. 

The provisions of this section do not preclude any natural or legal person from directly appealing to the Administrative Court of First Instance to challenge any administrative body decision that has affected them.
