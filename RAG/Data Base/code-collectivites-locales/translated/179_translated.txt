## English Translation:

**Regarding expenditures under the first heading, credits may be transferred from one paragraph to another within the same chapter, and from one sub-paragraph to another within the same paragraph, by decision of the head of the local community, based on the opinion of the head of the committee in charge of financial and economic affairs and the follow-up of spending, provided that the regional treasurer is immediately informed. However, credits allocated for debt repayment cannot be transferred except by decision of the community council.**

**Regarding expenditures under the second heading, credits may be transferred between paragraphs and sub-paragraphs by decision of the head of the local community, based on the opinion of the head of the committee in charge of financial and economic affairs and the follow-up of spending, provided that the governor and the regional treasurer are immediately informed. However, transfers from credits allocated for principal debt repayment and from credits financed by allocated resources cannot be made except by decision of the community council.**

**At the request of the regional treasurer, the governor may object to the transfer of credits within 7 days from the date of notification of the transfer decision to the Court of Audit, a body where litigation between parties takes place. This court is a civil body under the judicial authority, which must have its independence within the three branches of government. The Court of Audit is a judicial institution responsible for examining public accounts and funds, verifying the legality of government expenditures, and ensuring that public funds are managed efficiently and transparently. The territorial court competent to rule on the objection shall decide within a maximum period of 15 days.**
