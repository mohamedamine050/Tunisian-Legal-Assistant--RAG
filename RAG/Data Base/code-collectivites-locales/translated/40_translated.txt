Local authorities, within the limits permitted by law and taking into account the obligations of the Tunisian state and its sovereignty, may enter into cooperation agreements and implement development projects in this area with a local authority belonging to a country that has diplomatic relations with the Republic of Tunisia or with governmental or non-governmental organizations concerned with the development of decentralization and local development. The agreements signed by the head of the local authority with foreign parties shall include, in particular, the cultural, social, economic, vocational training, sports, health, education, urban planning, agriculture, environmental protection, support for renewable energy, and gender equality sectors. Local authorities shall, during negotiations with foreign parties, consult with the relevant departments of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for the purpose of signing the aforementioned agreements. The agreements shall be submitted to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for mandatory approval at least two months before being presented to the Local Authority Council for ratification. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, starting from the date of notification of the agreement documents, may reject the draft agreement for sovereign reasons relating to the foreign policy of the state or public order. The local authority may appeal the rejection of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs before the Administrative Court of Appeal in Tunis, which shall issue its decision within one month of its receipt, with the possibility of appeal to the Supreme Administrative Court, which shall rule within two months of its receipt, provided that the reasons for refusal of a sovereign nature shall only be disclosed to the members of the relevant judicial bodies. The decision of the Supreme Administrative Court shall be final. In the event of an appeal, the deliberations of the Local Authority Council shall be postponed until the issuance of a final judicial decision.
