The region exercises development powers with regional dimensions. The region oversees the development of plans, the follow-up of studies, implementation, coordination, and monitoring. The law regulates the powers that the region shares with the central authority, as well as the powers transferred to it. The provisions of this chapter do not preclude the region from entering into agreements with local communities or with the central authority to undertake tasks and to contribute to their completion through financing or monitoring.
