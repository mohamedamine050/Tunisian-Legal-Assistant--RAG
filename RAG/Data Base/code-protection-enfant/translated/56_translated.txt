**It is decided**

**By the Family Judge**

**The Family Judge** is a judge who makes legal decisions in court and contributes to the enforcement of the law and the achievement of justice. 

The Family Judge shall review research and reports submitted to him. He may decide that the matter does not merit action, or he may decide to refer the case to the judgment session. If the best interest of the child so requires, the Family Judge may take a temporary decision to remove the child from his family and authorize his placement under a **foster care** system. 

**Foster care** is a contract in the form of a valid agreement between the foster parent, who must be of sound mind, trustworthy, and capable of handling the affairs of the foster child, who must be a minor child, and the parents of the foster child or one of them if the other is deceased, unknown, incompetent, or habitually unknown to the guardian or the public guardian where applicable. The contract includes the foster parent’s commitment to care for the foster child. 

The parents are required to contribute to the child’s expenses. This decision is to be executed immediately.
