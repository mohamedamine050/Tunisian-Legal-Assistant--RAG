If a Family Court judge entrusts a Child Protection Officer with the completion of investigations and gathering information regarding the child's actual situation and the determination of their needs, the Officer shall be obligated to finalize the results of their work within a period not exceeding one month, unless the child's best interests necessitate an extension of the deadline, and the Family Court judge approves such extension.
