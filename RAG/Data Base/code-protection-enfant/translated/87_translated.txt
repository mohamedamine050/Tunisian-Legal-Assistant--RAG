The **Children's Judge** (Qadi al-Atfal) is a judge who makes legal decisions in court and contributes to the implementation of the law and the administration of justice. 

The **Children's Judge** directly or through a qualified person, undertakes all necessary actions and investigations to establish the truth, ascertain the child's identity, and identify appropriate means for the child's rehabilitation and protection. To this end, the judge acts with the best interests of the child in mind, and recourse to judicial commissions is exceptional. The **Children's Judge** may issue judicial warrants as required, in accordance with the procedural rules laid down in the Code of Criminal Procedure, taking into account the provisions of Article 93 of this Code. 

The **Children's Judge** obtains, through social investigation, all information regarding the family's financial and social situation, the child's personality and background, school attendance and conduct, and the circumstances of their upbringing and education. If necessary, the judge orders the creation of a medical file to be added to the social file, which involves conducting a medical and psychological examination of the child. This report must include the opinions and practical suggestions of experts, which will assist the court in charge of the case in making the necessary and appropriate decisions and measures. Experts, in expressing their opinions, must not be influenced by the severity of the crime attributed to the child. 

Considering the best interests of the child, the judge may order any of the aforementioned measures and issue a reasoned decision.
