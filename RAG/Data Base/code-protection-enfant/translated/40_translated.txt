1. The States Parties recognize that every child alleged as, accused of, or found to have infringed the penal law shall be treated in a manner consistent with the promotion of the child's sense of dignity and worth, which reinforces respect for the human rights and fundamental freedoms of others and takes into account the child's age and the desirability of promoting the child's reintegration and the child's assuming a constructive role in society.

2. To this end, and having regard to the relevant international instruments, the States Parties shall, in particular, ensure that:

(a) A child shall not be alleged as, accused of, or found to have infringed the penal law for any act or omission that was not prohibited under national or international law at the time it was committed;

(b) Every child alleged as, accused of, or found to have infringed the penal law shall have at least the following guarantees:

(1) To be presumed innocent until proven guilty according to law;

(2) To be informed promptly and directly of the charges against him or her, as appropriate, through his or her parents or legal guardians and to have legal or other appropriate assistance in the preparation and presentation of his or her defense;

(3) To be tried without undue delay by a competent, independent and impartial tribunal in accordance with the law, in the presence of legal counsel or other appropriate assistance and, unless it is considered not to be in the best interests of the child, in particular taking into account his or her age or situation, in the presence of his or her parents or legal guardians;

(4) Not to be compelled to testify or to confess guilt, to examine or have examined witnesses against him or her on his or her behalf under conditions of equality;

(5) If found to have infringed the penal law, to have the decision and any measures imposed in consequence thereof reviewed by a higher competent, independent and impartial authority or tribunal according to law;

(6) To have free assistance of an interpreter if he or she cannot understand or speak the language used;

(7) To have his or her privacy fully respected at all stages of the proceedings.

3. The States Parties shall endeavour to promote the establishment of laws, procedures, authorities and institutions specifically applicable to children alleged as, accused of, or found to have infringed the penal law, and in particular to ensure that:

(a) A minimum age be established below which children shall be presumed not to have the capacity to infringe the penal law;

(b) Where appropriate, alternative measures to judicial proceedings, such as care, guidance and supervision orders, counselling, probation, foster care, educational and vocational training programmes and other alternatives to institutional care shall be available to ensure that children are dealt with in a manner appropriate to their well-being and proportionate both to their circumstances and the offence.

4. Different arrangements, such as care, guidance and supervision orders, counselling, probation, foster care, educational and vocational training programmes and other alternatives to institutional care shall be available to ensure that children are dealt with in a manner which is appropriate to their well-being and proportionate both to their circumstances and the offence.
