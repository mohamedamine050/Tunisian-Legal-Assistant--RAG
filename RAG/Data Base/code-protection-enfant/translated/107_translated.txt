## English Translation:

The supervision of children placed under the system of supervised liberty is carried out by salaried delegates who receive stipends and volunteer delegates for supervised liberty. Salaried delegates are responsible for managing and coordinating the work of volunteer delegates under the supervision of the Judge of Children. They are also responsible for monitoring the children personally entrusted to them. Salaried delegates are appointed by the Minister of Justice, after consulting the Judge of Children, from among the volunteer delegates. Volunteer delegates are chosen from among adult men and women, and their appointment is made by the Judge of Children. The judicial body handling the case appoints a delegate either immediately by judgment, or later by decision.
