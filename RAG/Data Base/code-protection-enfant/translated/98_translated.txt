In cases of extreme necessity, the measures referred to in Article 97 of this Code may be taken by the **Emergency Judge**. 

The **Emergency Judge** presides over a jurisdiction characterized by its speed and simplicity of procedures, in contrast to substantive jurisdiction, which is known for its complex rules and lengthy procedures.

These measures may be requested by the child, a member of their family, a specialized child welfare institution, or the Public Prosecutor's Office.
