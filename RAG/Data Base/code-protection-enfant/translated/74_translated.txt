The territorial jurisdiction of the competent court is determined by the place of residence of the child, his parents, or the petitioner, or by the place where the crime was committed and, where appropriate, the place where the child was found or placed, whether temporarily or permanently. The court hearing the case may relinquish jurisdiction if the best interests of the child so require.
