The Children's Judge, acting on his own initiative or at the request of the Public Prosecutor, the child, his or her parents, guardian, or custodian, or based on a report from the Probation Officer, may rule immediately on all difficulties of execution and on all urgent matters. In other cases, however, the Children's Judge must review the child's file at least every six months to review the prescribed procedure, either on his own initiative or at the request of the Public Prosecutor, the child, his or her parents, guardian, custodian, lawyer, or the Director of the institution where the child is placed. However, the Children's Judge cannot substitute a protective measure with corporal punishment, though the reverse remains permissible.
