If the acts attributed to the child(*) are proven, the judge of the juvenile court shall, by a reasoned decision, take one of the following measures: 1) Delivering the child to his parents, to the person who presented him, to his guardian, or to a trusted person. 2) Referring him to the family court. 3) Placing him in a public or private institution equipped for education and vocational training and qualified for this purpose. 4) Placing him in a medical or medical-educational center qualified for this purpose. 5) Placing him in a reform center. 

A penal sanction may be imposed on the child, taking into account the provisions of this Code, if it appears that his reform requires it. In this case, the penalty shall be served in a specialized institution, and in the event of unavailability, in a juvenile wing of a prison.
