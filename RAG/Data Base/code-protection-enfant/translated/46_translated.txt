In cases of imminent danger, the Child Protection Delegate may take the initiative to remove the child from their current location, even by requesting the assistance of public forces, and place them in a safe location under their personal responsibility, while respecting the sanctity of dwelling places. An act is considered imminent danger if it is a positive or negative action that threatens the child's life, physical or mental well-being in a way that cannot be avoided over time.
