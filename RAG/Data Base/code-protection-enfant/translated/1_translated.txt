This Magazine, within the framework of the Tunisian national identity and the feeling of cultural belonging, aims to achieve the following goals:

1) To elevate childhood, with its inherent specificities that distinguish its physical potential, emotional tendencies, intellectual capabilities, and practical skills, to a level that requires care to prepare future generations by emphasizing attention to the children of the present.

2) To raise the child to cherish their national identity and to be loyal to Tunisia, its land, history, achievements, and to feel a sense of cultural belonging, nationally, Maghrebi, Arab, and Islamic, while being imbued with a culture of human brotherhood and openness to others, in accordance with scientific educational guidelines.

3) To prepare the child for a free and responsible life in a civil society based on solidarity, where there is a connection between awareness of rights and adherence to duties, and which is governed by the values of equality, tolerance, and moderation.

4) To implement the child's rights to care and protection in the major national choices that have made human rights a supreme principle guiding the Tunisian will and enabling it to elevate its reality towards the better, as required by human values.

5) To disseminate the culture of children's rights and enlighten people about their inherent specificities to ensure the harmony and balance of their personality, on the one hand, and the consolidation of awareness of responsibility towards them by their parents, family, and society as a whole, on the other hand.

6) To involve the child in appropriate ways in everything that concerns them, respecting and promoting their rights, considering their best interests, so that they may be raised with the qualities of work, initiative, personal gain ethics, and a spirit of self-reliance.

7) To raise the child to possess good morals, along with the need to develop their awareness of respecting their parents and their family and social environment.
