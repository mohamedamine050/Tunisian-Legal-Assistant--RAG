Offenses committed by a child who has reached the age of thirteen years shall be referred to the **Children's Judge**. The **Children's Judge** is a judge who makes legal decisions in court and contributes to the enforcement of the law and the achievement of justice.  Offenses involving such children shall be considered without the child's presence, unless the child or his guardian requests it.  If the offense is proven, the **Children's Judge** may merely reprimand the child, or sentence him to a fine if he has money, or place him under supervised liberty as necessary.
