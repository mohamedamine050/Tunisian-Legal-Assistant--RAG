Law enforcement officers may not question a suspect child or take any procedural action against them without informing the Public Prosecutor. If the alleged acts attributed to the child are of serious gravity, the Public Prosecutor must appoint a lawyer if the child has not already retained one for their defense. In all cases, law enforcement officers may not question a child under fifteen years of age without the presence of their guardian, custodian, or an adult relative who is authorized to represent them.
