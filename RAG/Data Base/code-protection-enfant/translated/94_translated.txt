In other cases that do not conflict with the provisions of this Code, a child may not be placed in a detention facility unless it is found necessary to take this measure or it appears that no other measures can be taken. In this case, the child shall be placed in a specialized institution. If this is not possible, the child may be placed temporarily in a special wing for children in prison, with the child being separated from other detainees at night. Failure to comply with this procedure shall lead to the prosecution of the person responsible for the violation.

During preventive detention, the child may enjoy leave on Saturdays, Sundays, and public holidays. This matter shall be considered by the court seized of the case.
