The judge, after reading the report, will hear the child, their parents or guardians, the affected party, witnesses, and authorized expert witnesses, as well as the child's lawyer. For guidance, they may hear from any original actors or participants involved in the case who have reached the age of eighteen. They may also excuse the child from attending the hearing if it is in their best interest. In such a case, the child will be represented by their lawyer, guardian, or representative. If these individuals are unavailable, a responsible adult appointed by the court will represent the child.
