If, during the period of supervised liberty, an incident occurs that reveals a **clear** (*) violation of the supervision by the parents, the presenter, the guardian, or if something happens intentionally that hinders the delegate from carrying out his mission, the competent court, regardless of the decision taken concerning the child, may, as the case may be, impose a fine on the parents, the presenter, or the guardian ranging from 10 to 50 dinars.

(*)  The translation of “بيّن” as “clear”  is an interpretation based on context. The term may have other nuanced meanings in legal contexts.
