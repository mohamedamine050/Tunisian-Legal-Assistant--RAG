The Child Protection Delegate shall, on a regular basis, follow up on the results of the agreed measures taken in the child's case. He shall, where necessary, decide to review them in a way that ensures, to the greatest extent possible, that the child remains in his family environment and is not separated from his parents or is returned to them as soon as possible.
