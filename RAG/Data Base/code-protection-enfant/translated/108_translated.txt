In all cases where a child is placed under a system of supervised liberty, the child and his/her parents, or the person who presented or is hosting him/her, shall be informed of this measure and its consequences. The supervised liberty officer shall prepare a report and submit it to the judge in charge of the case if the child's behavior deteriorates or he/she faces a moral risk, or if obstacles arise preventing the implementation of monitoring, or if it appears beneficial to change the location where the child is placed or his/her custody.
