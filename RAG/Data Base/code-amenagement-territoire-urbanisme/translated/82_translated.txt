The violator, who complies with the decision to stop work, may, within two months from the date of notification of the decision, submit an appeal to the competent administrative authority, which may, after consulting the technical committee provided for in Article 69 of this Code:

- either regularize the situation in accordance with the provisions of the applicable urban planning regulations,

- or demolish the building. In this case, the violator must demolish the unauthorized construction within one week of being notified of the decision rejecting the appeal. If the violator fails to do so, the municipality, the governorate, or the ministry responsible for urban development shall demolish the construction at the violator's expense within a maximum period of one month, resorting to public force if necessary.
