(Added by Article 2 of Law No. 78 of 2003 dated December 29, 2003). - The establishment of major commercial areas referred to in Article 5 (bis) of this law is subject to a prior license granted by a decision of the Minister in charge of Trade, after consulting with the Minister in charge of the Interior, the Minister in charge of Territorial Planning, and the Minister in charge of Social Affairs.

The license referred to in the first paragraph above is granted, taking into account the environmental impact study as provided for in Article 11 of this law, and an assessment of the potential impacts of the establishment of these areas on their economic and social environment within the scope of their expected commercial attraction, as well as their compliance with the licensing conditions and procedures set forth by an order proposed by the Minister in charge of Trade, the Minister in charge of Territorial Planning, and the Minister in charge of Social Affairs, after obtaining the opinion of the Minister in charge of the Interior.

The licensing conditions referred to in the second paragraph of this article relate particularly to the construction of car parks attached to these commercial areas, and to the development works that the project owner is required to carry out at his own expense to ensure that the roads leading to them meet the traffic requirements generated by the project.
