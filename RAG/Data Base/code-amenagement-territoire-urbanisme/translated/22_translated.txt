In the event that the authorization to carry out the restoration referred to in Article 21 of this Code is refused with respect to a property that has been declared by the competent authority to be in danger of collapse, the administration shall be obliged either to acquire it or to expropriate it if its owner refuses to transfer it by mutual agreement, or to authorize its restoration. In the first case, the administration shall take all necessary measures to avert the risk of damage that may result from the condition of the property.
