Urban planning schemes, in particular, regulate rules and regulations governing land use and specify:

1) Territorial areas according to their designated primary use, the nature of prevailing activities allowed to be carried out, and the activities prohibited in these areas.

2) “The permitted building density in each designated territorial area or part thereof, taking into account the capacity of the infrastructure and collective facilities, whether existing or planned, the nature of the soil in those areas, potential natural hazards, and environmental factors. When preparing or reviewing urban planning schemes, a building pattern consisting of a ground floor and two upper floors shall be adopted as a general rule for the permitted building density in areas zoned for such development, according to the above-mentioned criteria, and not subject to any special arrangements or agreements.” (Repealed and replaced by the first section of Law No. 78 of 2003 dated December 29, 2003).

3) The layout of planned roads to be maintained, modified, or created, and their specific features.

4) Areas for the protection of historical landmarks, protected areas, cultural and archaeological sites, agricultural and natural areas subject to protection, preservation, or revitalization regulations, as well as areas to be preserved due to their unique characteristics, such as the coastal strip.

5) Sites designated for public and collective infrastructure and facilities, green spaces, and public squares, according to an accompanying table issued by order.

6) Building regulations related to the right to erect buildings, their nature, and their purpose, taking into account measures that promote social integration within residential communities and the best use of land, and also considering the needs dictated by the specific situation of people with disabilities.
