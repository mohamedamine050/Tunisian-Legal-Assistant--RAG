The Governor or the Mayor, as the case may be, and the Minister in charge of Urban Planning, in all cases, may request the registration of undeveloped and unregistered land located within the areas designated by the decree referred to in Chapter 14 of this Code, after informing the owners. They have the right, pursuant to this Code, to obtain registration in the name of the owners, who cannot object to this, but they retain the right to submit all documents and evidence proving their ownership and to provide statements and observations supporting that ownership. The applicant for registration, whether the State or the local public authority concerned, shall bear the costs resulting from the registration process stipulated in the judgment. These costs shall be entered in the land registry as a preferred debt in their favor. These costs shall be recovered from the owner upon the sale of the entire property or part thereof, or upon its division or the application for a building permit. The methods of recovery shall be determined by an order proposed by the Minister in charge of Urban Planning after consulting with the Minister of Finance.
