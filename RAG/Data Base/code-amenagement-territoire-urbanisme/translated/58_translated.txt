**Division** shall mean any process of dividing a plot of land into three or more lots, prepared, after development, for the construction of residential, professional, industrial, tourist, or shared social and cultural facilities, as required by this Code. In the case of dividing a plot of land into two lots, such division shall be subject to prior approval from the Mayor or Governor, as per the relevant jurisdiction, after obtaining the opinion of the technical committee provided for in Article 60 of this Code. The documents comprising the file relating to this operation shall be regulated by the same decision referred to in Article 59 of this Code. 

Any **contract** of lease or sale intended to re-divide a plot into less than ten years after an initial division shall be considered a division, unless such division is not subject to any form of appeal. The sale of a part or parts in common ownership of a property intended for construction, in accordance with the **regulations** currently in force, shall also be considered a division. 

The provisions of this Chapter shall not apply to operations related to:
