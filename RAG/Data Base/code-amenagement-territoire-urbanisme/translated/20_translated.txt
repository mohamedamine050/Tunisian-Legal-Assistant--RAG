Following the approval of the zoning plan, the local public authority concerned or the ministry responsible for urban planning shall carry out, in the field, all practical measures to define the areas designated for roads, public squares, green spaces, and areas allocated for collective facilities, by placing visible identification markers.  Care shall be taken to ensure that these markers do not hinder the normal use of the properties concerned by the delimitation process, by their owners. No area that has become green by virtue of the zoning plan may lose its character by virtue of an order proposed by the Minister responsible for urban planning, after obtaining the opinion of the Minister responsible for the environment and territorial development.
