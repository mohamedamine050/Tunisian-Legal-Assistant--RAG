The provisions of the second paragraph of Article 63 of this Code shall not apply to the State, real estate agencies, local public authorities, and real estate developers operating under Law No. 17 of 1990 dated February 26, 1990, concerning the amendment of the legislation on real estate development. These provisions shall also not apply to the divider who undertakes the preliminary works of development and requests permission to postpone the completion of the final works in order to avoid deterioration of roads and their edges during the construction of buildings. A decision by the Minister in charge of planning shall specify the type of temporary development works and the final works mentioned in the second paragraph of this Article, as well as the method of their acceptance by the governorate or municipal authorities, as the case may be. However, the response to the request for permission to postpone the completion of the final works shall remain subject to the divider's undertaking to complete the works within the deadlines set by the division decision and to provide a guarantee for the completion of these works, which shall consist of:

- Either a bank guarantee under which the guaranteeing institution undertakes to pay the sums necessary for the completion of the works, in addition to the sums due for the expenses provided for in Article 24 of this Code. 
- Or a pledge of lots in favor of the concerned local public authority, the value of which is equal to the sums provided for in the preceding paragraph. 

The value of the works subject to the guarantee or pledge shall be determined by a decision issued by the governor or the mayor, as the case may be, following an examination conducted by the regional services of the Ministry in charge of planning. The provisions of Article 12 of the aforementioned Law dated February 26, 1990 shall not apply to public real estate developers and local public authorities.
