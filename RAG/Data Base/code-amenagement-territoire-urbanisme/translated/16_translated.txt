(Paragraph two is repealed and replaced by Article 1 of Law No. 29 of 2009, dated June 9, 2009). - The local public authority concerned, in conjunction with the territorially competent services of the ministry responsible for urban planning, shall prepare and review draft urban planning examples. The draft example shall then be submitted to the public institutions and establishments concerned and to the regional administrative services for written opinions with justifications, within a maximum period of one month from the date of its transmission to them.  Failure to reply within this period shall be considered implicit approval by the recipient of the draft example, which shall be submitted to the ministry responsible for urban planning upon the expiry of that period for consideration and return within one month from the date of its transmission to it. The project shall subsequently be submitted to the municipal or regional council, as the case may be, which shall authorize its posting at the municipality's, the delegate's, or the governorate's headquarters for public consultation.  A call for tenders in relation to the project shall be published in the audio-visual and print media and in the Official Gazette of the Tunisian Republic. During the two months following this procedure, any interested party may record their observations or objections in the register dedicated to this purpose at the municipality's, the delegate's, or the governorate's headquarters, or submit a written objection by registered mail to the relevant administrative authority.
