The value of the land and real estate subject to the transformation and compensation process is determined by a committee composed of individuals with relevant expertise from various parts of the institution, selected through a formal procedure. This committee is chaired by a judge appointed by the President of the **Court of First Instance** where the property is located. The committee also includes three real estate experts: the first appointed by the President of the **Court of First Instance**, the second by the President of the relevant local public authority, and the third by the owner concerned, their legal representative, or their legal proxy. The owners concerned are notified of the value of the compensation or the amounts resulting from the compensation operations by registered mail with an acknowledgement of receipt, sent by the President of the committee to the owner or owners concerned, or to their representatives if they are minors or absent.
