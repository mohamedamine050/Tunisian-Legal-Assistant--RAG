An amendment, whether partial or total, to an approved subdivision may be approved upon the request of the divider before the sale or transfer of the plots extracted from it. Similarly, amendments permitted under the terms and conditions of the industrial or tourist subdivision may be approved upon the request of the divider or plot owners, provided they are consistent with the planning scheme and do not conflict with public health regulations. (The first paragraph was repealed and replaced by the first chapter of Law No. 29 of 2009 dated June 9, 2009).

Furthermore, amendment requests from the owner(s) of plots extracted from an approved subdivision may be approved, provided they are compatible with the urban planning regulations applicable to the area where the subdivision is located and do not affect the direct interests of other owners. "This approval is granted after the relevant local authority posts the draft planning scheme at the headquarters of the governorate or municipality, as applicable, and after publishing a notice of inquiry by posting it and through the audio-visual and written media, and informing the concerned owners by registered mail with notification of receipt. In the latter case, the applicant for the amendment shall bear the costs of notification." (Repealed and replaced by the first chapter of Law No. 78 of 2003 dated December 29, 2003).

"During the month following the date of publication of the inquiry, any interested party may record their consent in the inquiry register, kept for this purpose at the headquarters of the relevant governorate or municipality." (Repealed and replaced by the first chapter of Law No. 78 of 2003 dated December 29, 2003).

"Amendment proposals are approved if requested or approved by two-thirds of the owners representing three-quarters of the subdivision area, excluding areas incorporated into public or private state or local authority land, in accordance with the procedures stipulated in Article 60 of this Code." (Repealed and replaced by the first chapter of Law No. 78 of 2003 dated December 29, 2003).
