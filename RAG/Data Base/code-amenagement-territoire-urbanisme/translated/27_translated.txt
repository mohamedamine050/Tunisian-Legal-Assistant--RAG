Except for areas covered by approved development schemes or areas covered by special regulations, all construction operations are subject to general urban planning regulations, which are approved by order upon proposal from the Minister responsible for Urban Planning. These regulations are administrative decisions of a general nature and do not relate to any specific individual. They concern the location of buildings, the manner of their construction and access, their size, the definition and distribution of green spaces, public squares, and communal facilities, the method of constructing essential infrastructure and facilities of public interest, the preservation of the environment, and the prevention of natural hazards. They take into account the needs dictated by the specific situation of people with disabilities. A joint decision of the Ministers responsible for Urban Planning and Agriculture establishes the minimum areas for agricultural land and the maximum areas for buildings that may be constructed thereon.
