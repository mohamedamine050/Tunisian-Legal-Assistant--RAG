An occupancy permit shall be issued to every owner of a building who presents a certificate of inspection confirming that the works comply with the provisions of Article 73 of this Code. However, this permit may be issued to an owner who has built a structure without complying with the requirements of the building permit granted to him, provided that he has complied with the current urban planning regulations and general administrative decisions that do not apply to a specific individual. In this case, and before the occupancy permit is issued, he is required to revise the plans accompanying the building permit to bring them into conformity with what he has actually built.
