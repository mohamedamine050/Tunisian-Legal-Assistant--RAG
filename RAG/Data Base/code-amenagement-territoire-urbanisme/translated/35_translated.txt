The State or local public entities may, for their own benefit or for the benefit of the real estate agencies stipulated in Article 30 of this Code, acquire any real estate located within the area of intervention for the implementation of the planning, development, renovation, and beautification programs stipulated in the same Article. The State, local public entities, and the agencies stipulated in Article 30 of this Code shall benefit, with regard to the same real estate, from a right of pre-emption, exercised for a period of four years from the date of the issuance of the order establishing the area of intervention, under the same conditions stipulated in Law No. 21 of 1973 dated 14 April 1973 concerning the development of tourist, industrial, and residential areas. This right of pre-emption may be extended once for a period of two years. The beneficiary of the right of pre-emption within the area of intervention shall request the provisional registration of their right in the land registry with regard to the registered real estate. This registration shall prevent the registration of any transfer, with or without consideration, in the land registry concerned from the date of its registration. The provisional registration shall lapse and its effect shall cease upon the expiry of a period of three years from the date of its registration if it is not renewed before the expiry of the aforementioned period, within the time limit of the right of pre-emption. (Paragraph three was abolished and replaced by Article 1 of Law No. 78 of 2003 dated 29 December 2003).

After the approval of the program and the detailed planning plan relating to it, the beneficiary of the area of intervention shall carry out all the practical procedures on the ground to delimit the areas covered by the area of intervention, by placing clearly visible delimitation signs, taking care to ensure that these signs do not hinder the normal use of the real estate concerned by the delimitation process by their owners. The beneficiary of the right of pre-emption within the area of intervention shall, within one month from the date of issuance of the order relating to the delimitation of that area, post the accompanying plan at the headquarters of the governorate or municipality, as the case may be, for a period of three months and invite the public to consult it through the means of audio-visual and print media. (Paragraph five was abolished by Article 2 of Law No. 78 of 2003 dated 29 December 2003).
