Planning and development projects are subject to an impact assessment study. This study also applies to the establishment of facilities that, due to their size or significant consequences, could have adverse effects on the natural environment. The conditions for applying the first paragraph of this chapter, as well as the elements constituting the impact assessment study and the list of planning and development projects and the establishment of facilities subject to impact assessment procedures, are regulated by ministerial order. 

The competent administrations shall not grant final approval for the projects referred to in the first paragraph above unless the impact assessment study relating to them has been submitted to the Minister responsible for the environment and land planning for approval. Based on the impact assessment study, the Minister responsible for the environment and land planning may propose any measure or amendment to the project that would prevent or mitigate its adverse consequences on the natural environment, general environmental balances, and the regulation of land use. All necessary amendments and modifications to the project are made through agreement between the Minister responsible for the environment and land planning and the Minister responsible for the project under review. 

In the event of disagreement, the planning or development project or the establishment of the facility, together with the impact assessment study, shall be submitted to the Ministerial Committee referred to in Chapter 3 of this Code for arbitration.
