No compensation shall be payable for servitudes resulting from general administrative regulations, not related to a specific person, taken for the benefit of public security and the security of military installations, traffic, and the preservation of historical, archaeological, and traditional heritage, particularly those related to land use, building height, the ratio of built-up and unbuilt areas for each property, and the prohibition of construction in certain areas. This shall be the case, except in situations where such servitudes result in direct, tangible, and permanent material damage:

1) To buildings legally authorized;

2) To properties where a part thereof has become unusable.

In these two instances, the owner must submit a request to the relevant administrative authority for compensation within six months of being informed by this authority of the servitudes imposed on their property, failing which their right will be extinguished. The administrative authority must respond within three months of receiving the request for compensation. The owner may file a legal action before the competent courts if they do not accept the administration's offer in this regard, or if they are not responded to within the three months mentioned in the preceding paragraph. However, owners of properties where a part thereof remains usable may not claim compensation except for that exceeding one quarter of its total area. (3) For properties that have become entirely unusable, in which case their owners may request their acquisition by the administration. In the event that these owners express their wish, in writing, to retain their properties, they shall not be entitled to claim any compensation thereafter. 

Compensation, in all of the aforementioned cases, shall be paid either by mutual agreement or through litigation before the competent courts, in accordance with the legislation governing expropriation for public interest. However, the amount of compensation shall be assessed based on the use for which the property will be allocated, and the servitudes resulting from its arrangement or protection, when it concerns properties subject to servitudes for the preservation of historical, archaeological, and traditional heritage.
