The responsibility for monitoring the work of building owners, as well as architects, contractors, or any person responsible for the execution of works, lies with the courts having jurisdiction. This applies when works are carried out without respecting the requirements or agreements related to the building's location, height, distance from neighboring properties, the authorized construction area, or the alignment required if the building adjoins a road or public facilities. Those committing violations as stipulated in the first paragraph of this chapter shall be punished with a fine ranging from five hundred dinars (500 DT) to five thousand dinars (5000 DT).
