Divisions may only be established, developed or modified within areas encompassed by a preliminary urban planning scheme or a detailed urban planning scheme, if any, or within areas defined pursuant to Article 14 of this Code, after verifying the availability of the essential necessary infrastructure, whether existing or expected to be completed in these areas. The division file shall be submitted to a technical committee, established by a ministerial order by the Minister in charge of urban planning, for its opinion prior to approval. The committee is a formal method for bringing together experts with relevant expertise from different parts of the institution.  In all cases, the governor or the mayor, as appropriate, or the Minister in charge of urban planning may make any useful amendments and require the retention of green spaces, public squares and areas designated for collective facilities in accordance with the applicable regulations and urban planning rules. They may also require the divider to adjust the boundaries of their division. In the event that neighboring owners do not agree to such adjustments, the competent administrative authority shall resort to expropriating the necessary plots in accordance with applicable legislation.
