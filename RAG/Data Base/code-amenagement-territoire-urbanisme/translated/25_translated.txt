**(Repealed and replaced by the first section of Law No. 78 of December 20, 2003)**. - Notwithstanding the administrative regulations of a general nature that do not relate to a specific individual, and without prejudice to specific regulations that may be issued for certain areas with unique natural, architectural, aesthetic, security, or archaeological features, building is prohibited in areas not covered by an approved urban development plan within a distance of less than one hundred meters from the limits of the maritime public domain and from the limits of certain components of the public water domain, namely lakes and salt marshes not naturally and superficially connected to the sea, navigation channels, waterways, and waters confined to valleys. This distance may be extended in areas threatened by coastal erosion or flooding, and whenever the protection of the coastal strip or the public water domain necessitates it, by an order proposed by the Minister in charge of Urban Development after consulting with the Minister in charge of the Interior, the Minister in charge of the Environment, and the Minister in charge of Agriculture. In areas covered by an approved urban development plan, building is prohibited within a distance that is determined according to the specific situation of each area, but shall not be less than twenty-five meters in all cases, starting from the limits of the maritime public domain and from the limits of the components of the public water domain mentioned in the first paragraph of this section. However, in the event that it is necessary to introduce harmony into the seaside fa√ßade of the urban fabric, this distance may be reduced by an order proposed by the Minister in charge of Urban Development after consulting with the Minister in charge of the Interior and the Minister in charge of the Environment, provided that the reduction in this distance shall not, in any case, affect the right of passage easement stipulated in the first paragraph of Section 17 of Law No. 73 of July 24, 1995, concerning the maritime public domain. Similarly, with regard to lakes and salt marshes whose banks and waterways of small size crossing urban areas are being developed, this distance may be reduced by an order proposed by the Minister in charge of Urban Development after consulting with the Minister in charge of the Interior and the Minister in charge of Agriculture, provided that the reduction in this distance shall not, in any case, affect the right of free bank easement stipulated in Section 40 of the Water Code issued pursuant to Law No. 16 of March 31, 1975.
