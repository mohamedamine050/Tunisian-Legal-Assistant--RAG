## English Translation:

A ministerial committee for spatial planning has been established. This committee has the responsibility to define major spatial planning choices, ensure consistency across spatial distribution among various planning and development programs, and provide opinions within the scope of these responsibilities on:

- Major programs for infrastructure and equipment,
- Major programs for urban development,
- The guiding examples of planning referred to in Article 7 of this code, both at the national, regional, or major urban agglomerations levels,
- Sectoral guiding examples of planning and development prepared by various ministries or public structures and institutions under their supervision,
- Procedures that contribute to the organization of the use of spatial territory at the national level and the protection of the environment.

The ministerial committee for spatial planning may issue recommendations on all matters submitted to it that would ensure consistency between the choices being defined or contributed to their realization. It may also provide its opinion on all matters submitted to it, particularly those related to the implementation of these choices and their impact on the environment.
