Upon approval of the subdivision, roads, green spaces, public squares, and areas designated for communal facilities are incorporated into the public domain or the private domain belonging to the State or the local public authority.  This integration does not entail any compensation or penalty, except for the area exceeding one-fourth of the subdivision and based on the average price of the incorporated lands. In the absence of an amicable settlement, the penalty is determined by the competent courts in accordance with the legislation in force on expropriation for public interest. In the event that the subdivision includes a registered property, the Land Cadastre and Mapping Office shall, upon completion of the demarcation process, send to the Property Registry Administration copies of the sections incorporated into the public or private domain of the State or local public authorities. The Property Registry Administration, relying on the copies sent by the aforementioned Office, shall extract the incorporated sections from its original register and create new entries for them in the name of the State or the relevant local public authority.
