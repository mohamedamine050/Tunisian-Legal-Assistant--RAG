The guiding examples for territorial planning establish the fundamental territorial orientations for the planning of the concerned territorial areas, taking into account the relationships with neighboring entities and the balance that must be maintained between urban expansion, the practice of agricultural activities, and other economic activities.  They also take into consideration the necessity of protecting natural and cultural sites, including archaeological sites and conservation areas, as defined by current legislation. These examples guarantee the regulation of the use of territorial space by directing the focus of programs of the state, local public authorities, institutions, and public services and by working towards their coordination within the framework of economic and social development perspectives.

The guiding examples for planning specifically determine the fate of land in general, the layout of major infrastructure, the general organization of transportation, the location of structured equipment, services, and the most important activities, cultural sites including archaeological sites and conservation areas, historical landmarks that must be protected or revived, as well as the general trends for the expansion and development of urban agglomerations.  These examples also take into account natural hazards and impacts on the environment.
