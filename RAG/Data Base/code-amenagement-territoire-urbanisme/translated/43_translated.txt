Every owner of real estate within the real estate savings zone, subject to the right of preemption, may, from the date of the determination order, offer to the beneficiary of this right to purchase this property and determine the price that they agree upon, provided it is not greater than or less than the value of the property. The beneficiary of the right of preemption must inform the owner within one year of receiving the offer of their decision to accept or refuse it, through a bailiff. Failure to respond within this period will be considered a waiver by the beneficiary of the right of preemption. 

If the beneficiary of the right of preemption accepts the offer and agrees on the price, a transfer agreement will be executed between the parties. Payment of the agreed upon price must be made within six months of the execution of the agreement, either directly to the seller or deposited into the public treasury of the Tunisian Republic. In the event of disagreement on the price of the property, it will be determined by the competent courts, as is the practice in matters of expropriation for public benefit, and the determined price must be paid in full or secured with the public treasury of the Tunisian Republic within six months of the final judgment.

The beneficiary of the right of preemption may not take possession of any property within the real estate savings zones without paying the price to the owner or securing it with the public treasury of the Tunisian Republic.
