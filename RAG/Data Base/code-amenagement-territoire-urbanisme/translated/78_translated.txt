Pursuant to the relevant regulations, the purchasers or lessees affected, the municipality or the governorate, as the case may be, and the Ministry in charge of urban development in all cases, may claim the annulment of sales or lease contracts due to non-compliance with the provisions related to the subdivision or the specifications. This shall be at the expense of the seller or lessor, irrespective of civil compensation. 

The competent authority may also, if necessary, and after notifying the party concerned by registered letter, require the execution or authorization of the necessary works within a period of three months to bring the subdivision into conformity with the approved specifications. The costs shall be borne by the owner. The competent authority may also expropriate the subdivision to prepare it in accordance with the provisions of the code and then resell it.
