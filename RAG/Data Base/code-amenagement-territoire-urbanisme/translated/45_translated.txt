An association of owners may be established, encompassing all owners of land and real estate within a specific area, upon its formation. This establishment can be initiated based on a request from the concerned owners, a suggestion from the President of the Regional Council outside of the municipal area, or from the Mayor within the concerned municipal area.  A ministerial decision by the Minister in charge of Urban Planning, published in the Official Gazette of the Tunisian Republic, is required for its creation.  The purpose of these associations is to implement urban planning and reconstruction schemes, facilitate property mergers or divisions, develop private roads and their appurtenances, and execute all legal and administrative procedures to resolve real estate situations within the area.  

These associations possess legal personality within the limits of the tasks defined by this law. The President of the local public authority concerned prepares a model to define the area subject to the establishment of the association of owners. This model is made public by posting and by publishing an announcement in the Official Gazette concerning its deposit at the office of the concerned governorate or municipality.  The public may then consult this model.  The decision to establish an association of owners includes the approval of the defined area of intervention in accordance with the model referred to in the previous paragraph of this chapter.
