All works requiring a permit under the provisions of this Code, upon completion, shall be subject to inspection by the competent authorities of the governorate or municipality, as the case may be, to verify their conformity with the plans attached to the building permit. This process shall be carried out at the request of the interested party or on the initiative of the municipality, the governorate, or the departments of the Ministry responsible for urban planning, as appropriate. It shall be concluded with a report stating whether the works have been completed as required. The inspection report shall be delivered to the applicant within two months from the date of the submission of the request or from the date of the inspection if it was carried out on the initiative of the relevant authority.
