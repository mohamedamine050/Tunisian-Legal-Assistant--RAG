The rights and obligations of the fishermen comprising the crew are regulated by the legislation applicable to seafarers, except for the special provisions stipulated in this Code and in the laws and regulations specific to fishermen. The same system applies to shore-based fishermen working within a team departing from the shore or working individually.
