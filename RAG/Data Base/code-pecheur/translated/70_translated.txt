A representative, officially elected for a term of one year by secret ballot, is chosen by a fishing vessel with a crew of at least eight members. This representative is officially appointed according to established procedures. 

A deputy representative is also elected to replace the main representative in case of absence or impediment. In the event of more than half of the crew being replaced within the period between two elections, the fishermen can request a new election.

The election is held at a location designated by the competent authority for this purpose, under the supervision of this authority, in the presence of the captain, his assistant, and representatives of the equipment suppliers' union and the fishermen's union. A report is drawn up on the outcome of the vote, with copies sent to the competent authority, the equipment suppliers' union, the fishermen's union, and the captain of the vessel.

The representative is responsible for reporting complaints related to the application of applicable laws, especially those concerning maritime work, health, and safety, to the equipment supplier or the competent authority. However, they are not allowed to interfere in the vessel's navigation under any circumstances. The captain must be informed of any complaint during the voyage, while the complaint is recorded in writing upon the vessel's arrival at port and submitted at the end of the work to the equipment supplier or their legal representative, and to the competent authority in case of dispute.

All fishermen registered in the crew register are considered voters.  All fishermen who have spent at least one year actively at sea are eligible to be elected.
