The maritime fisherman must join the vessel to commence the work for which he was hired on the day and at the hour designated by the outfitter or the captain. If some of the maritime fishermen registered in the crew logbook are absent after the logbook has been sealed, the captain may, exceptionally and in urgent cases, replace them up to a quarter of the crew without the intervention of the competent authority, taking into account the provisions of the **applicable regulations**. The captain must notify the competent authority, before the vessel sets sail, of a list of the maritime fishermen who have been replaced. The corrections to the crew logbook entries shall be made upon the vessel's arrival at the first port where the competent authority is represented.
