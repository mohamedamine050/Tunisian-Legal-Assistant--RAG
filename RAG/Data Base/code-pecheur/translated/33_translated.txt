The fisherman, in the event of an accident while working in the service of the vessel, is treated at the expense of the outfitter until the injured party comes under the purview of the insurance system.

**Contract of Insurance**

A contract of insurance is a binding legal agreement that obligates the contracting parties and defines their obligations and rights regarding the specific transaction. Under this contract, the insurer undertakes to pay the insured or beneficiary a sum of money, a regular income, or any other financial compensation in the event of the occurrence of the insured event, in exchange for premiums or any other financial payment made by the insured to the insurer.

Against occupational accidents, the outfitter also guarantees the return of the fisherman to the port of departure. After disembarkation, the outfitter is obligated to pay the fisherman a daily penalty for two months, equivalent to the difference between the minimum wage and the amount paid by insurance institutions. Following this period, the outfitter pays another two months of daily penalty, equivalent to the difference between half the minimum wage and the amount paid by insurance institutions.

In case the fisherman is hired on a share basis, the wages he is entitled to under this section are calculated based on the minimum wage paid in the port of departure to fishermen of the same rank and category, as determined by the competent authority. The injured party retains the right to appeal the decision to the courts.
