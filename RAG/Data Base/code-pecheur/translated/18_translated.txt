## Descent of the Sea Fisherman Ashore by His Own Will:

**(a)** The sea fisherman may descend ashore and leave his work provided that he is not indebted to the outfitter or that the new outfitter undertakes to pay the debts owed by the fisherman, which are to be declared by both parties before the competent authority. 

**(b)** Descent may only occur after the expiry of a prior notice period of at least 72 hours given by the sea fisherman to the outfitter, unless the latter agrees to the immediate descent. 

**(c)** The contract is terminated upon the prior notice, which must be given in writing or orally in the presence of two witnesses, and the notice of termination must be delivered by the sea fisherman to the outfitter and recorded in the crew logbook by the competent authority. The aforementioned provisions apply to the captain and the machinist, with the prior notice period being at least eight days.
