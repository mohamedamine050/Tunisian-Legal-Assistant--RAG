The work regime on board the vessel is governed by the captain, who is the authority in determining the departure and arrival times at port.  However, rest periods are determined by a minimum of ten hours for every 24 hours of work, either consecutively or in installments, without causing a work stoppage.  For paid maritime fishermen, a lump sum rest may be granted at the end of the voyage.
