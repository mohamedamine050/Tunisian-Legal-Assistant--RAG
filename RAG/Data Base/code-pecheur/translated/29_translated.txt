The minimum number of crew members required to operate fishing vessels, taking into consideration the conditions of navigation, work onboard ships, the power of the propulsion systems, the type of fishing, and local practices, shall be determined by a joint decision of the Ministers responsible for Fisheries and Merchant Marine, after consulting with the Supreme Council for Fisheries. The competent authority may monitor the minimum number of crew members upon submission of the vessel owner, his deputy or the captain, of the crew list.
