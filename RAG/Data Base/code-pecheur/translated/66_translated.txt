The Collective Agreement for Maritime Fishing Employment is an agreement concerning the terms of employment aboard maritime fishing vessels concluded between maritime fishing equipment providers organized in a group or operating individually on the one hand, and professional fishing trade union organizations on the other. This agreement must be in writing, otherwise it is null and void. The provisions of this Agreement shall apply obligatorily to every fishing equipment establishment regarding the relationships between the equipment providers and the fishermen resulting from individual or crew contracts, unless the provisions of these contracts are more beneficial to the fishermen than the provisions of the Collective Agreement. The equipment provider must post a notice on board the vessel, which shall state the existence of the Collective Agreement, the parties to it, the date of deposit and the place of deposit. A copy of this Agreement shall be placed at the disposal of the fishermen, along with the ship's logbook.
