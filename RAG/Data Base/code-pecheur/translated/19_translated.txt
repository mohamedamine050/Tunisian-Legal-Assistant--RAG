## Dismissal of a Fisherman by the Shipowner:

**Article:**

The shipowner or his representative may, at his own initiative, dismiss the fisherman from work. In this case, the fisherman shall be entitled to wages for the period of actual service on board the vessel, and to a dismissal penalty equivalent to thirty days' wages, and to compensation whose amount shall be determined by the competent authority. In case of dispute, **[Note: This phrase is repeated, so we need to ensure consistent translation]**  either party may bring the matter before the competent court. 

**b)** The shipowner or his representative may dismiss the fisherman for a serious reason that may endanger the safety of the vessel or disrupt the peace of the crew, after obtaining permission from the competent authority. The reason for dismissal shall be recorded in this case in the crew logbook. In this case, the fisherman may not claim the dismissal penalty and the compensation provided for in the preceding paragraph.
