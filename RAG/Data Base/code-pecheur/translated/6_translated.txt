Individuals under the age of 15 years old may not operate fishing vessels. Consequently, they are ineligible to obtain a maritime professional certificate. However, they may participate temporarily in work aboard fishing vessels during school holidays, provided that such work is not detrimental to their health and natural development, does not disrupt their school attendance obligations, and is not undertaken for commercial profit.
