Any person who conceals, embezzles, or participates in the concealment of funds belonging to a convicted person, a person against whom a judgment has been issued, or a person who has been found responsible for a crime and sentenced to a penalty or precautionary measure, shall be punished by imprisonment for a term of six months to two years and a fine of one thousand to five hundred thousand francs, or by either of these penalties. All contracts and acts carried out in violation of the provisions of this article shall be null and void, without prejudice to the rights of third parties acting in good faith. If any of these acts are committed by a judicial trustee, the penalty shall be doubled, and the person shall be ordered to return the concealed or embezzled funds.
