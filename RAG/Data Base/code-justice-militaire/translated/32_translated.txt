(Amended by the first chapter of Decree No. 69 of 2011 dated July 29, 2011).- The public prosecutor's office before the [Court of First Instance], which is a civil court subject to the judicial authority that must have its independence within the three branches of government,  [is not subject to any form of appeal]. 

The Court of Cassation, which is the highest court in the judicial hierarchy, is justified in this by the principle of cassation to oversee the proper application of laws by the courts of first instance. 

In the event of a rejection of a request for cassation, the decision of the Court of Cassation and the case file shall be referred to the military prosecutor's office at the court that issued the contested decision or judgment.
