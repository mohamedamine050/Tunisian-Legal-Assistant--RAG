Any military personnel or equivalent who crosses the Tunisian border without authorization, leaving the unit to which they belong and joining a foreign country, shall be considered a deserter abroad during peacetime, provided that three days have elapsed since their illegal absence. This period is reduced to one day during wartime.

The military personnel or equivalent who deserts abroad shall be punished by imprisonment for a term ranging from three to five years. If the deserter is an officer, the sentence is increased to six years. In addition, if extenuating circumstances are granted, the deserter shall be dismissed from service. (Amended by Article 8 of Law No. 23 of 1989 dated February 27, 1989).

The prison sentence is increased to ten years if the military personnel deserts abroad under the following circumstances:

* If the deserter takes with them a weapon, equipment, animal, or any other equipment belonging to the army, or clothing other than what they normally wear.
* If the deserter flees during the performance of their duties or in the face of insurgents.
* If the deserter has previously deserted.
* If the deserter flees during wartime, in a territory in a state of war, or in an area where a state of siege has been declared.
* If the deserter is an officer, they shall be punished by imprisonment for a term of twenty years. If extenuating circumstances are granted and the deserter is sentenced to imprisonment, they shall also be dismissed from service.
