**(Amended by the first chapter of Decree No. 69 of 2011 dated July 29, 2011).** - The Permanent Military Court comprises chambers whose number is determined by order, with at least one of them being a criminal chamber. This criminal chamber may handle other crimes if the interests of justice require it. These chambers are at the same level as the chambers of the Primary Courts in the judicial system. Each criminal chamber consists of a president from the judicial system and two military judges, while the criminal chamber consists of a president and four counselors from the military judges. The functions of the public prosecutor are carried out by the Public Prosecutor of the Permanent Military Court or one of his assistants. The function of the court clerk is performed by a non-commissioned officer from the military judicial non-commissioned officers. The president of the court and the heads of the chambers shall be judges from the judicial system during peacetime, with the judicial rank required to hold such positions in the judicial system. The position of president of the Permanent Military Court in Tunisia is held by someone who meets the requirements to hold the position of president of the Primary Court in Tunisia, while the position of president of the Permanent Military Court outside Tunisia is held by someone who meets the requirements to hold the position of president of a Primary Court outside Tunisia. The president of the Permanent Military Court presides over the criminal chamber and coordinates the work of the other chambers, and he is replaced, as necessary, by the senior heads of chambers in rank.
