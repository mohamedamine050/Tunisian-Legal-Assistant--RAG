In times of war, or whenever the internal or external security of the country so requires, additional military courts may be established, either attached to the army or within a specific region, by order of the Head of State upon the proposal of the Minister of National Defense. These courts shall adjudicate, in accordance with the rules of jurisdiction and procedures set forth in this law or in any legal texts issued as necessary, on crimes committed in combat zones or in any other region of the Tunisian territory.
