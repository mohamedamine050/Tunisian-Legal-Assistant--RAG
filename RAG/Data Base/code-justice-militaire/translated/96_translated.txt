Any military personnel who misuse the authority granted to them for requisition, in accordance with the laws and regulations, or who refuse to issue a receipt for what they have received for the requisition, shall be punished with imprisonment for a period of two months to two years. Any military personnel who deliberately carry out requisition without authorization shall be punished with imprisonment for a period of one to three years if the requisition was carried out without the use of violence, and for a period of six years if it was carried out with violence. The offender shall also be ordered to return the requisitioned items. (Paragraph 2 of Chapter 8 of Law No. 23 of 1989, dated 27 February 1989, has been amended). If the offender is an officer, they may be additionally punished with dismissal, provided that the dismissal is not an inevitable consequence of the sentence imposed.
