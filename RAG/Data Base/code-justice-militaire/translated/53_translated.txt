Mobilization, or call-up, refers to the summons of some or all reservists to military service in the event of a foreign aggression or for other military purposes. This also includes maneuvers. Mobilization or call-up begins from the date the order is issued and places the entire army or a portion thereof in a state of mobilization or call-up until the date the order to cancel this state is issued.
