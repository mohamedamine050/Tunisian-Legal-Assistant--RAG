If a written judgment is issued by a court resolving a legal or factual matter, in absentia against a deserter who has fled to the enemy or fled before the enemy, or a delinquent who has joined a foreign country and remained there during the war, neglecting his military duties, the court shall rule in favor of the state treasury by confiscating his movable and immovable, common and private, present and future assets. The judgment ordering confiscation shall be immediately directed to the state's agent at the court of first instance within whose jurisdiction the residence of the convicted person is located. The agent of the state shall issue a decision from the president of the court or the governor of the district appointing a judicial trustee. The judicial trustee shall inform the supervising judge of the ledger monthly and whenever requested. The trustee must also inform the partners or any party with an interest in the ledger or provide them with a copy of the data it contains after they have obtained prior authorization from the supervising judge. The judicial trustee shall be responsible for seizing and managing the confiscated assets and gains. The president of the court or the governor of the district may, by a decision they issue, authorize the provision of financial assistance from the proceeds of the aforementioned properties to those who depend on the convicted person for their livelihood. The agent of the state shall, within three months following the date of the declaration of the end of the war, serve the judgment issued by the military court to the residence of the convicted person. If six months have passed since the date of this service and the convicted person has not appeared, all their assets shall be sold in accordance with the procedures followed in selling state property. First, all court costs shall be paid from the proceeds of the sale, followed by the debts owed by the convicted person. The remainder of the price shall be paid to the state treasury if the convicted person has no heirs. Otherwise, one-third of the remainder shall go to the state and the remaining two-thirds shall be distributed among the heirs in accordance with their inheritance rights obtained at the end of the aforementioned six months. If the convicted person appears in person or is arrested after the sale has been completed, and is acquitted by a new judgment, the competent authority shall examine the compensation due to the state for the material damages incurred. If the death of the convicted person is proven within the aforementioned six months, it shall be considered that they died while in possession of all their civil rights and their heirs shall be entitled to claim all their assets or their price in case of sale.
