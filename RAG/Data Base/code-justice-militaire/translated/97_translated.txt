**Amended by Article 8 of Law No. 23 of 1989 dated February 27, 1989.** â€“ Any officer who, without provocation, order, or authorization, intentionally commits any hostile act in neutral, allied, or friendly territory, or who continues hostile acts after having officially received an order to declare peace, truce, or cessation of hostilities, shall be punished by imprisonment for a term of ten years.  The same punishment shall be imposed on any military personnel who assumes command without orders or legitimate reason, or who retains command in violation of the orders of their superiors. In both cases, in addition to the aforementioned punishment, the offender shall be dismissed from service if an officer, and mitigating circumstances shall be granted.
