The **Court of Cassation**, a court of law where disputes between parties are settled, is a civil court that falls under the judicial authority, which must be independent within the three branches of government. The Court of Cassation is considered the highest court in the judicial hierarchy, justified by the principle of cassation for overseeing the proper application of laws by the courts of first instance. This principle applies to the military courts in their public proceedings, as outlined in Articles 170 and 171 of the Tunisian Criminal Procedure Law.
