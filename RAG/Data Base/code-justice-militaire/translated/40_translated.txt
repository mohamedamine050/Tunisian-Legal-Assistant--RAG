The trial is public before the Military Court, and any violation of this principle renders the proceedings void. However, the Court may decide to conduct the trial in secret in accordance with general law or whenever it deems that publicity would harm the interests of the army, but the judgment shall be delivered publicly in all cases. The Military Court may prohibit the publication of the proceedings or summaries thereof if it deems that the case warrants such a measure.
