**Article 8, Paragraph 1, of Law No. 23 of 1989, dated February 27, 1989, is hereby amended as follows:**

"Any military personnel who intentionally assaults a guard with violence while armed, with the intent of preventing the guard from performing their assigned duty, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term of six years."

If the violence is committed by an unarmed military personnel, but in the company of one or more individuals, the punishment shall be imprisonment for a term of one to three years. If the assault with violence is committed by an unarmed military personnel acting alone, the punishment shall be imprisonment for a term of six months to three years.

The maximum penalty stipulated in each of the three aforementioned cases shall be imposed if the violence occurs during wartime, in times of war, or in a region where a state of siege has been declared, or if it takes place within a fortress, arsenal, weapons depot, or ammunition storage facility, or on the perimeters of these locations.

If the offender is a civilian, the punishment shall be reduced by half.

In addition to the aforementioned penalties, the officer convicted of the offense shall be dismissed from service, provided that such military dismissal is not automatically entailed by the imposed sentence.
