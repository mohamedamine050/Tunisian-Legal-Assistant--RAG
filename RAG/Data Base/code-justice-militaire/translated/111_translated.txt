Any military personnel who abandons their post shall be punished with imprisonment for a period of two to six months. The term "post" refers to the location designated by their superiors for the performance of assigned duties. If the abandonment of the post occurs in the presence of rebels, in a region under wartime conditions, or in a zone declared under a state of siege, the punishment shall be imprisonment for a period of five to ten years. If the abandonment of the post occurs in the presence of the enemy, the offending military personnel shall be punished by death. The maximum penalty shall always be imposed on the offender if they are the head of the post.
