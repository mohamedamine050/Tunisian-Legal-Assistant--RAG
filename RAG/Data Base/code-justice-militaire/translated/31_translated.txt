(As amended by Article 1 of Decree No. 69 of 2011 dated July 29, 2011.) - An appeal by way of cassation in judgments issued by military courts shall have the same effect as an appeal by way of cassation in judgments issued by courts of general jurisdiction. 

An appeal by way of cassation is a remedy that allows you to challenge a court decision that you believe is contrary to the law or where the procedure has not been respected.
