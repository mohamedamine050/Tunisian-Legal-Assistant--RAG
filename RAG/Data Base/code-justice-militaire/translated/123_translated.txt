**(Amended by Decree No. 12 of 1979 dated October 10, 1979)** - Any Tunisian who enlists himself or another in the service of a State at war with the Tunisian State, or joins the rebels, shall be punished by death.  "Any Tunisian who, during peacetime, places himself at the disposal of a foreign army or a terrorist organization operating abroad shall be punished by imprisonment for a period of ten years, with deprivation of his civil rights and the confiscation of his property in whole or in part. This does not preclude the imposition of penalties for offenses against State security, whether the accused acts independently or pursuant to the instructions of that organization" (The second paragraph of Article 8 of Law No. 23 of 1989 dated February 27, 1989 has been amended).  The same penalty shall be imposed on anyone who incites or facilitates the commission of any of these crimes by any means whatsoever. 

Irrespective of any conflicting provisions, the Permanent Military Court, at the request of the Military Prosecutor, shall determine the nature of the portion of the property of the concerned person that will revert to the State.  The same Court shall take such measures as it deems necessary to preserve the State's right to such gains and shall authorize the disbursement of any necessary advances for the benefit of the accused's dependents, if it decides to place these gains under escrow during the trial.  If a judgment of confiscation is issued in absentia, the confiscated portion shall be placed under escrow for a period of three years, at the end of which it shall become the property of the State. However, if a final judgment acquitting the accused is issued after an appeal, the accused's property, or its value, as the case may be, shall be returned to him.
