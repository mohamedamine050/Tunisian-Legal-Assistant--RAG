Direct military personnel may not marry unless they have obtained written permission from the Secretary of State for National Defense. This permission is valid for six months and may be renewed.

Any violation of this rule shall be subject to disciplinary sanctions, the maximum penalty of which may be dismissal or termination of employment.
