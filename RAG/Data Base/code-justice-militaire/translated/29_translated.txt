(Amended by the first chapter of Decree No. 69 of 2011 dated July 29, 2011). - The Court of Cassation is a court where litigation takes place between parties. It is a civil court under the judicial authority, which must be independent within the three branches of government. The Court of Cassation is considered the highest court in the judicial hierarchy, justifying its position by the principle of cassation to oversee the proper application of laws by the courts of origin in decisions issued by the indictment department and final judgments and decisions issued by military courts. One of its counselors is replaced by a military judge from the body of military judicial officers of the judicial rank required to hold that position in the judicial apparatus, appointed by order.
