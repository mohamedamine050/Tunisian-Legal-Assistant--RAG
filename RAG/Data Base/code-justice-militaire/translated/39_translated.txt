(Repealed and replaced by Article 1 of Law No. 25 of 1980 dated May 23, 1980).- Notwithstanding the provisions of the Organic Law concerning appointments and promotions, an appointment or promotion may be made, even after death, to the next higher rank to reward a significant act of war or an exceptional act of heroism in defense of the homeland or for the preservation of its security.  A promotion to two ranks may also be granted to non-commissioned officers and enlisted personnel. For these exceptional promotions, the condition of competence that qualifies the candidate to assume the responsibilities of the new rank must be taken into account.  An exceptional reward may be granted in the form of a promotion, an advancement by one or more grades, or a lump-sum grant determined according to the circumstances, to military personnel who: - exceptionally accomplished a method of work that resulted in an improvement in the quality of operational activities or administrative services or resulted in cost savings, - or who, alongside the National Army or the State, inflicted significant damage, - or who distinguished themselves by a high degree of skill in performing their duties. The appointment or promotion of military personnel, as well as the granting of exceptional rewards to them, shall be made by the President of the Republic, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, pursuant to the provisions of paragraphs one, two, three and four of this Article. (Paragraphs four and five were added by Article 2 of Law No. 47 of 2009 dated July 8, 2009).
