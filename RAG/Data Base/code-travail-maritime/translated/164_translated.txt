Every judgment or decision issued by a court in writing resolves a legal or factual issue.  The court, which is a body established for the purpose of litigation between parties, is a civil institution that falls under the judicial authority and must be independent within the three branches of government.  The judgment or decision is communicated to the parties in writing by registered mail with return receipt requested within three days of its issuance, to their chosen addresses, and to the maritime authority.
