The master of a vessel may not dismiss a seaman before giving him notice, nor may he require the seaman to disembark except for a valid reason that could endanger the safety of the vessel or disrupt the well-being of the crew. This dismissal must be authorized by the maritime authority and the reason for the dismissal must be recorded in the ship's logbook. In such a case, the seaman is not entitled to any penalty. However, compensation may be claimed if the dismissal resulted in harm to the seaman.
