The Court, the court competent to adjudicate disputes between litigants, is a civil court falling under the judicial authority which must be independent within the three branches of government. 

The Court shall consider the settlement [1] an agreement reached to resolve a dispute and put an end to litigation, which occurs when both parties compromise on some of their claims or hand over money or a right [2] an agreement by which the parties terminate an existing dispute or prevent a potential dispute, by each party mutually relinquishing their rights, in the disputes referred to in Article 151. The rules governing the reference for review and appeal of judgments shall be those provided for in the legislation currently in force, with the exception of any deviations from these rules set forth in this Code.
