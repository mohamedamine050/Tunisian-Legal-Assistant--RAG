The lease agreement must specify the duration of the lease or the voyage for which it is concluded. If the contract is concluded for a fixed period, the date on which the lease ends must be stated. If it is concluded for an indefinite period, it is imperative to specify the notice period that must be observed in the event of a decision to terminate. The notice period for termination must be the same for both parties. If the contract is concluded for a single voyage, the agreement must state the name of the port where the voyage ends and the time of the commercial and maritime operations conducted in that port upon completion of which the voyage can be considered terminated. In the event that this specification does not allow for an approximate estimation of the voyage duration, a maximum period must be established within the contract. After the expiration of this maximum period, the mariner may request disembarkation at the first port where cargo is unloaded or the ship docks, even if the voyage for which the contract was concluded has not yet ended.
