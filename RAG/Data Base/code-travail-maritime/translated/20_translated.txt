A seaman shall not be registered in the ship's crew logbook of a vessel that routinely undertakes voyages exceeding seventy-two hours, unless he has undergone a medical examination conducted by a physician designated or approved by the maritime authority. The maritime authority, after consultation with the designated labor unions representing employers and seamen, shall determine the type of medical examination to be conducted, taking into account the seaman's age and the nature of the work assigned to him. 

The document issued following this examination shall attest, in particular, that the holder is not suffering from any ailment that may worsen during maritime work, render him unfit for such work, or pose a risk to the health of others on board the vessel. The medical document issued to a person under twenty years of age shall remain valid for a period not exceeding [duration] from the date of issuance. The medical document issued to a person who has reached the full age of twenty years shall remain valid for a period determined by the maritime authority. If the validity period of the medical document expires during a voyage, the document shall remain valid until the end of the voyage. 

A seaman who has not been issued a medical document has the right to undergo a new examination by an independent medical expert appointed by the maritime authority, who shall be independent of any employer or organization of employers. 

Furthermore, masters, officers, drivers, and others responsible for operating machinery, individuals assigned to maritime observation duties, and those without the required certificates assigned to watch on the ship's bridge or in the engine room shall, in addition, present a document from a specialized physician attesting to their hearing and vision, as well as their ability to distinguish colors. This document shall be renewed: 

(a) By order of the maritime authority in the event of any error revealing a deficiency in hearing or vision, an inability to distinguish colors, or for any other reason;

(b) Every five years in all cases.

The maritime authority may, in cases of certainty, authorize the sailing of a seaman with an exemption from the medical examination, on the condition that the examination be conducted in the first port where a representative of the maritime authority is present.
