The actual work of seafarers on board vessels not equipped for fishing, regardless of the category of personnel they belong to, cannot exceed eight hours per day and forty hours per week, or a period not exceeding the limit calculated on the basis of a period of time other than the week. Each hour worked beyond the daily working hours specified in the preceding paragraph shall be considered overtime and shall be compensated with an increase in wages. 

Seafarers working on board vessels not equipped for fishing must be granted six consecutive days of rest, which may be accumulated. A rest day consists of twenty-four consecutive hours of rest, calculated from the usual time the seafarer in question is required to commence their daily work. Any work performed on a rest day shall result in the suspension of its effect, unless the cause of the work is an emergency that does not exceed two hours in duration.
