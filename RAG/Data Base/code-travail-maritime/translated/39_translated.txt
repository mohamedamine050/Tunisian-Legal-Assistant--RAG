Upon the termination of each maritime employment contract, the employer, or his representative, shall be entitled to a certificate stating that the employer has fulfilled its obligations arising from the contract. Such certificates are exempt from stamp duty and registration. Work certificates issued to seafarers, even if they contain data other than those referred to in the preceding paragraph, are exempt from stamp duty and registration, provided they are free from any obligation, receipt, or any agreement imposed for the purpose of extracting relative information. Similarly, the phrase "free from any obligation" and any expression referring to the termination of the maritime employment contract and the services rendered are considered to fall within the aforementioned exemption.
