Summonses to appear before the Court, a Court that serves as a forum for litigation between parties, is a civil court that falls under the judicial authority which must be independent within the three branches of government.  Customarily, disputes related to lease agreements are handled by the Court Clerk, a judicial official responsible for maintaining records and managing the court's documents. The aforementioned summons can be issued from one day to the next, or even from one hour to the next, and the Court will adjudicate the matter promptly.
