The provisions of Articles 93 and 95 shall not apply in the following cases:

(1) If the seaman caused the illness or injury intentionally, or if the illness or injury resulted from his gross negligence.

(2) If the state of intoxication of the seaman directly caused the illness or injury.

(3) If the illness or injury resulted from the seaman's breach of regulations, particularly if he left the ship without permission. However, in such cases, the master must undertake the treatment of the seaman until he disembarks ashore, if necessary. However, a seaman who is no longer able to continue his work on the ship shall lose his right to wages from the day on which he ceased working. The ship shall bear the expenses of his accommodation and food on board until his disembarkation. These expenses may be deducted from any amount due to the seaman.
