If the seaman dies during the term of the contract of hire, his heirs are entitled to his wages until the day of his death.

If the seaman is employed for a voyage consisting only of the outward journey, and his wages are agreed upon by contract, or by a share of the profits or of the ship's earnings, then his full wages or share are due if he dies after the commencement of the voyage.

If the employment is for a round voyage, then half of his wages or share are due if he dies during the outward journey or at the port of arrival, and his full wages or share are due if he dies during the return journey.

If the seaman is killed while performing any duty arising from his employment, with the intention of saving the ship or defending her, then the wages, profits, and shares due to him shall always be fully payable for the whole duration of the voyage, if the ship reaches a safe haven, and in case of the ship being declared unfit for navigation or being wrecked or abandoned, upon the discharge of the crew.
