In the event of the vessel's seizure or detention, the charterer or the master may terminate the charter party.

The charter party is a legally binding agreement that obligates the contracting parties and defines their obligations and rights in relation to the specific transaction.

The maritime lease may be terminated from the moment the vessel ceases to operate, unless such events prevent the seaman from returning to his port of departure. If the seaman remains on board the vessel while it is stopped, he shall be entitled, by way of penalty, to fifty percent of his wages for the duration of his presence on board the vessel, based on the agreed wages. However, if the charterer or the master compels the seaman to work during his presence on board the vessel while it is detained, he shall be entitled to full wages for the days he worked, based on the agreed wages.
