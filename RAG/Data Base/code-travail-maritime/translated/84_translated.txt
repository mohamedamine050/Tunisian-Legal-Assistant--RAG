A seafarer, upon being confined, may transfer his wages and shares, provided that this transfer is only to a person under his legal or actual guardianship and that the amount transferred does not exceed half of his total wages and shares. 

The transferred amounts shall be paid to the transferees in accordance with the agreement between the parties. The method of payment of the transferred amounts, their periodic amounts, the names of the transferees, and their addresses shall be recorded in the crew logbook and signed by the transferor. 

The seafarer who has not exercised his right to transfer upon confinement may do so during the voyage within the aforementioned limits and conditions. The master shall immediately notify the supplier of the request.

The seafarer may also request that a portion of his wages be paid to him on account during his absence, at regular intervals of at least one month, into an account opened in his name. This payment cannot exceed half of the earned wages.

The supplier shall regularly pay the transferees or forward the transferred amounts to them when they become due. He must also be responsible for paying the portions of wages that the seafarer has requested to be paid on account.
