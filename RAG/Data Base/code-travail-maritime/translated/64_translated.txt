**Amended by Law No. 59 of 1995 dated July 3, 1995**

**In the event of a vessel's total loss by sinking, the seaman shall be paid his wages until the day of the disaster. From that day onwards, and for the actual period during which he is unemployed, he shall be entitled to compensation equal to the wages stipulated in the charter party. However, the amount of this compensation shall in no case exceed the wages of two months.**

**In the event of the vessel being used on a voyage, the agreed-upon wages shall be paid to the seaman without additional compensation if the probable duration of the voyage ends within two months from the date of the disaster. In addition, the seaman shall be paid for the days spent in salvaging the wreck of the vessel or the sunken or loaded goods, on the basis specified in the first paragraph of this chapter for calculating compensation for unemployment.**

**The provisions of this chapter shall apply to any vessel, regardless of its type, whether or not it is required to maintain a crew log, owned by the public or private sector, engaged in maritime navigation, except for warships and fishing vessels.**
