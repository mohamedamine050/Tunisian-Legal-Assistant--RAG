In the case provided for in Article 72, the liquidation shall take place in accordance with the provisions of Article 60 above. If the liquidation takes place in a foreign country, pursuant to the last paragraph of Article 78 above, payment shall be made upon arrival, subject to the inspection of the maritime authority.

It is permissible to pay a portion of the wages or the entire amount upon disembarkation, by order of the maritime authority, as needed. If a delay in payment occurs due to a reason attributable to the employer, the seaman may claim damages. The payment of wages and shares shall be recorded in the crew logbook and in the seaman's logbook, under the signature of the latter, or the signature of two witnesses chosen by him, if he cannot or does not know how to sign. This payment must be accompanied by a discharge note issued in accordance with the provisions of the applicable legislation. Shares of profits or ship's wages shall be paid in accordance with the agreement of the parties or customary practices.
