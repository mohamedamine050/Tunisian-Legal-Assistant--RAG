Every contract is a legally binding agreement that obligates the contracting parties and defines their obligations and rights in relation to the specific transaction.

A contract of seafaring, specifying the entire or partial seafarer's remuneration by a share of the profits or by a fixed wage, must specify the expenses and costs to be deducted from the generated income to arrive at the net income. It is not permissible to deduct any amount not stipulated in the contract, as this would infringe upon the seafarer's rights.

If a dispute arises between the parties during the settlement of accounts, the maritime authority may request the employer to provide detailed accounts of shared expenses and costs, along with details of income and profits, supported by relevant documentation and original accounting records.

A seafarer employed with a share of the profits or by a fixed wage is entitled, in addition to his share, to compensation for delays in departure, prolonged voyages, or shortened voyages caused by the employer or the captain if he suffers any damage as a result.

If the delay, prolongation, or shortening is caused by the shipper or a third party, the seafarer shall contribute to the compensation awarded to the ship in proportion to his share of the profits or his fixed wage.
