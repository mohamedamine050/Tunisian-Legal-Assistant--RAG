If a seaman, without authorization, fails to appear at the time he is required to join his work, or is absent without authorization during the term of his contract, he loses his right to wages for the duration of his absence, in addition to any damages the shipowner may claim. The seaman also loses his right to wages from the date on which he loses his liberty due to an accusation of committing a crime. The provisions of this chapter do not conflict in any way with the provisions of the preceding Chapter 43.
