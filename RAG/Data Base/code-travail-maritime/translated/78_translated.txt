Accounts relating to the wages of seafarers are settled upon the closing of the crew logbook at the end of each voyage. In the case of domestic coastal navigation, settlement occurs at the end of each month. The wages of a seafarer disembarking from a vessel individually, whether in Tunisia or abroad, are settled upon disembarkation, prior to the closing of the crew logbook.
