(Amended by Law No. 59 of 1995 dated July 3, 1995). A seaman who disembarks ashore upon the termination of his contract of employment has the right to be repatriated at the ship's expense to the port of disembarkation stipulated in the contract of employment, or, if this is not feasible, to a port in his country of origin or nationality. All expenses for repatriation must include all expenses related to transportation, accommodation, and food during the journey, as well as expenses for his personal needs until the time of his departure.

Repatriation expenses shall not include expenses for the provision of clothing. However, the master must, if necessary, advance the seaman the necessary clothing expenses, and these expenses may be deducted from the seaman's wages if he is disembarked ashore for disciplinary reasons, or due to injury or illness contracted under the circumstances stipulated in the first paragraph of Article 96 above. 

The State shall bear the repatriation expenses of a seaman who is disembarked for the purpose of appearing before the courts or serving a sentence. Repatriation expenses for a seaman disembarking ashore during the voyage after the termination of the contract of employment by mutual consent shall be subject to their agreement, under the supervision of the maritime authority.
