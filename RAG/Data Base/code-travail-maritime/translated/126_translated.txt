The Joint Maritime Labor Agreement is an agreement concerning working conditions on board merchant vessels, concluded between employers organizing fleets or acting personally on the one hand, and a labor union or unions of seafarers on the other. This agreement must be in writing, otherwise it shall be considered null and void. In each employing entity, the provisions of this agreement shall govern the relations arising from individual or collective contracts if the terms of such contract are more beneficial to the seafarers than the terms of the Joint Agreement. The head of the employing entity shall post a notice on board the vessel, which shall contain the existence of the Joint Agreement, the contracting parties thereto, the date of deposit and its location, and shall make a copy of the Agreement available upon request by the seafarers.
