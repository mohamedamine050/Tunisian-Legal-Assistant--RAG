## English Translation:

The deletion from the maritime register can be effected:

1) If one of the conditions stipulated in paragraphs 1, 2, 3, and 4 of the preceding chapter is not met,

2) If the vessel remains inactive for three years, unless for reasons beyond the owner's control. In this case, the owner must submit a request to the maritime authority within two months of the deletion.

**Note:** The term "deletion" is used throughout the text to translate "التشطيب," which refers to the removal of a vessel's registration from the maritime register. This process is akin to the "cancellation" of a mortgage in real estate law.
