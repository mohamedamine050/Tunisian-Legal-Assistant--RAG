## English Translation:

**Minutes of Reconciliation**

[1] A contract designed to resolve a dispute and bring an end to litigation. This is achieved by each party involved in the reconciliation relinquishing some of their claims, or by the delivery of a sum of money or a right. [2] A contract through which the parties bring an end to an existing dispute or prevent a potential dispute. This is accomplished by each party reciprocally relinquishing their right, or by refraining from exercising it. These minutes record the terms of the agreement reached between the parties and the reasons preventing its execution.

The parties present have signed these minutes, or it is noted that they cannot sign due to illiteracy or incapacity. A copy bearing the Maritime Authority stamp is provided to those who request it.

The agreed-upon terms are binding upon the parties.
