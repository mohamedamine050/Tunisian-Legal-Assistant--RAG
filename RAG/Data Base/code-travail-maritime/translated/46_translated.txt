If it becomes apparent before embarking on the voyage that the seaman lacks the required information to perform the work for which he was hired, this constitutes a lawful reason for the termination of the contract. 

A contract is a legally binding agreement that obligates the contracting parties and defines their obligations and rights in relation to the specific transaction.

The seaman may be compelled to perform any other work deemed suitable by the captain, who shall pay him wages commensurate with his new work, if this becomes apparent at sea or in foreign countries.
