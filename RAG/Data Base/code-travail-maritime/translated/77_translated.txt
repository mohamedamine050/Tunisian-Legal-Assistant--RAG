The mariner's wages, regardless of the method of chartering, must be paid in legal tender. The mariner's base pay is determined by an order, and payment of wages in foreign countries may be made in the currency of that country, at the prevailing exchange rate on the day of payment, and under the supervision of the maritime authorities in accordance with the applicable legislation on the matter. The agreement following the maritime charter prevents the supplier from imposing conditions on the mariner that would restrict his ability to freely dispose of his wages.
