In the event that the lease agreement stipulates that all or part of the remuneration shall be a share in the profits or in the ship's hire, the mariner shall be entitled, upon termination of the lease agreement, to a penalty determined by agreement between the parties or by the Court, if the termination was due to the act or fault of the furnisher or his representative. If the termination was due to the act or fault of the shippers, the mariner shall contribute to the ship's expenses in proportion to his share in the profits or ship's hire.
