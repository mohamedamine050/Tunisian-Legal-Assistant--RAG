## Contract

A contract is a legally binding agreement that obligates the contracting parties and defines their obligations and rights with regard to the specific transaction.

## Maritime Lease

A maritime lease is only valid if it is concluded by the lessor or the seafarer himself. The seafarer, and when necessary, his advisor, must be granted the necessary facilities to examine the lease before signing it. The maritime authority remains outside these processes, but it is responsible for endorsing the contract after verifying, by questioning both parties and when necessary by reading aloud the terms and conditions of the contract and its clauses, that these terms and conditions are known and understood by them. The maritime authority must refuse its endorsement if the contract includes terms that violate the provisions of this law or public order.

## Offenses

Offenses that are punishable by death or imprisonment for more than five years are classified as felonies.

Offenses that are punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding fifteen days but not exceeding five years, or by a fine exceeding sixty dinars, are classified as misdemeanors.

Offenses punishable by imprisonment not exceeding fifteen days or by a fine not exceeding sixty dinars are classified as violations. [122 Penal Procedure Code]

Except for the scenario mentioned in the previous paragraph and the case of the absence of the conditions stipulated in the first paragraph of Article 21, this falls under the scope of attempted fraud and shall then be subject to restriction under the provisions of Article 13 above.
