Disputes arising in Tunisia at the port of departure, the port of arrival, or the port of landing shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the maritime authority and the customary court established in that port. In all other cases, as well as if, due to the ship's departure, it becomes impossible to pursue the case before the authorities mentioned in the preceding paragraph, the competent authorities shall be the maritime authority and the customary court established at the port of the seaman's domicile or residence, or at the port where the seaman is temporarily located, if the dispute arises from the outfitter. However, if the dispute arises from the seaman, the competent authorities shall be the maritime authority and the customary court established at the port where the outfitter has its principal maritime responsibility or agency, if any. Otherwise, the competent authorities shall be those established at the port where the ship is berthed.
