In the event of the ship's requisition or seizure, or if the ship becomes unfit for navigation for reasons not attributable to the outfitter's act or fault, the mariner employed by shareholding or for the voyage shall be entitled to his wages for the days worked. The mariner employed by a share in profits or in the ship's wages shall receive payment according to the terms of the contract. 

The contract is a legally binding agreement that obligates the contracting parties and defines their obligations and rights with respect to the specific transaction. The contract governs his share in the profits or the wages earned by the ship.
