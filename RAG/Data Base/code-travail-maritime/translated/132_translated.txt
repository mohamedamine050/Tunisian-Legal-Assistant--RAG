The joint agreement for maritime labor between the trade unions of shipowners and seamen, which represents the majority and imposes its provisions on all shipowners and seamen, shall enter into force on the day of its deposit, upon request of the party most interested in obtaining the approval of the Secretary of State in charge of the Merchant Marine. The latter shall issue a decision accepting or rejecting the agreement, with reasons, without being able to amend the text of the agreement submitted to him. He may not refuse approval without obtaining a reasoned opinion from the advisory committee for the joint agreement.  If approval of the agreement is refused, it shall not be binding even between the contracting parties.
