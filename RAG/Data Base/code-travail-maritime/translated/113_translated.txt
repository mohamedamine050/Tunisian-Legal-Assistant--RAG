If annual leave becomes due, it shall be granted after agreement between the parties at the first opportunity as required by the exigencies of the work. The employer cannot refuse to grant this leave to the seaman after he has spent twelve months working on board the ship, nor can anyone be compelled, without his consent, to take the annual leave to which he is entitled at any port other than the port of the country in which the ship was registered and where he resides.
