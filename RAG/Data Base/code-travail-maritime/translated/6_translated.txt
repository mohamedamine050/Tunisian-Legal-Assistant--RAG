Every sailor working on a vessel flying the Tunisian flag must possess a booklet issued to him by the maritime authority at the port of his first engagement. Consular officials who engage them at a foreign port, upon their first engagement to work on a Tunisian vessel, shall issue an identity certificate which shall serve as a substitute for the booklet until the maritime authority in Tunisia prepares the booklet if required.
