**(Amended by Law No. 59 of 1995 dated July 3, 1995).** In the case provided for in Article 93 (new) of this Law, 

the shipowner is required to pay to each seaman who is injured or sick:

a. Full wages during the entirety of his stay aboard the vessel. 
b. From the date of his disembarkation, a financial compensation equal to full wages for the first two months and half wages for the following two months.  The shipowner's obligation ends either upon the seaman's recovery or the confirmation of the permanent nature of his illness or disability, or when he becomes the responsibility of a social security institution. However, if a sickness benefit is paid by a social security institution, the shipowner shall only pay the seaman the difference, which is calculated according to the provisions of the first paragraph of this article.

If the seaman's wages, in whole or in part, are a share of the **profit** or from the ship's freight, the wages due as stipulated in the first paragraph of this Article shall be calculated based on the average daily wage paid in the port of departure to seamen of the same rank and category. This shall be determined by the maritime authority, while preserving the right to appeal to the courts.
