**(Pursuant to Law No. 95 of 1995, dated July 3, 1995)**  Seafarers are entitled, after completing twelve consecutive months of work, to paid annual leave provided by the shipowner at a rate of one and a half days for each month of work on board the vessel. To determine the period for which leave is due:

A. Work performed by the seafarer outside the contract of employment shall be included in the calculation of the period of continuous work.

B. Short interruptions in work that are not due to the seafarer's fault and that do not exceed a total of six weeks in each period of twelve months shall not be considered as interrupting the continuity of the work period preceding or following them.

C. Changes in the ownership or management of the vessel or vessels on which the seafarer worked shall not be considered as interrupting the continuity of the work period.
