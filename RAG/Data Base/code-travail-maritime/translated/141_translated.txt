A person who has not attained the age of eighteen years is not legally competent to enter into a contract. 

A contract is a legally binding agreement that obligates the contracting parties and defines their obligations and rights in relation to the specific transaction.

A minor shall not be allowed to enter into a contract for seafaring employment and shall not be registered in the ship's crew register without the authorization of their legal guardian or, if applicable, their representative, or, if neither is available, the Judge of the Courts of First Instance, unless the minor enjoys full civil rights according to the personal status law governing their situation. 

If the contract for seafaring employment is entered into in Tunisia and the minor has not obtained the authorization of their father or representative, the presiding judge of the court shall grant such authorization, either on his own initiative or upon the request of a family member, after hearing the father or the representative, or after summoning them. 

This authorization shall confer upon the minor the legal capacity necessary to perform all acts required by their commitments, particularly to receive their wages. The minor shall be competent to enter into all subsequent commitments unless the authorization is revoked. 

The revocation of the authorization cannot be invoked against third parties unless they were notified of it prior to the conclusion of the contract. The authorization cannot be revoked once the seafarer reaches the age of eighteen years.
