The parties may appoint an assistant or representative to represent them before the Court of First Instance, which is a civil court that falls under the judicial authority and must be independent within the three branches of government. This representative may be a maritime or shipping expert, a lawyer registered with the Bar Association, or a representative from the professional trade unions of seafarers or shipping companies. In addition, a director or employee of the project or company may represent them. The representative must present a power of attorney, which may be appended to the original or a copy of the summons to conciliation or to appear before the Court of First Instance. The expert and the lawyer are exempt from presenting a power of attorney. However, the Maritime Authority and the Court of First Instance may, in all cases, order the parties to appear in person.
