If, after the logbook has been closed, two crew members are missing, the captain may exceptionally, upon confirmation, replace them up to a quarter of the crew complement without the intervention of the maritime authority, taking into account the established procedures. The captain must submit to the maritime authority before the vessel's departure a list of the crew members who have embarked the vessel in this manner. The existing entries in the logbook must be amended as soon as the vessel arrives at the first port of call where a representative of the maritime authority is present.
