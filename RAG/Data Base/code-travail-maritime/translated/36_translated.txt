If the mariner proves to the outfitter or his deputy, either his ability to obtain a position as captain of a vessel, or as an officer or engine room officer, or any other position he occupies, or that there is a compelling interest in his ceasing work for urgent reasons since his engagement, he may request his dismissal, provided that he provides a replacement of equal competence and acceptable to the outfitter or his deputy, without incurring any additional expenses for the outfitter or the mariner. In this case, the mariner is entitled to wages for the period of his work.
