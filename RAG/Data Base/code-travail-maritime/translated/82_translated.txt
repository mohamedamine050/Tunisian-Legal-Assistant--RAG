A mariner, upon request, may be granted advances on his wages, either upon signing on or during the voyage. Regardless of the terms of the charter party, advances paid at the time of signing on may only be made with a record of the maritime authority and under its supervision. The amount of such advances cannot exceed one month's wages for mariners engaged in seafaring or five times the total wages due for each voyage, if the voyage is not expected to exceed one month.
