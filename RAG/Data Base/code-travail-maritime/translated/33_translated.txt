Amended by Law No. 59 of 1995 dated July 3, 1995.

**Contract**

A contract is a legally binding agreement that obligates the contracting parties and defines their obligations and rights in relation to the specific transaction.

A lease contract concluded for an indefinite period may be terminated by either party at a port of shipment or unloading of the vessel, subject to the respect of the agreed advance notice period, which must not be less than twenty-four hours.  The unlawful termination of the contract shall result in the payment of a penalty determined according to the prevailing customs of the port and the type of services committed, taking into account all circumstances that may justify the existence of damage and determine its extent.
