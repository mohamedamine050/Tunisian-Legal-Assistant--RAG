A maritime trainee or apprentice may not work more than eight hours per day. He must enjoy weekly rest, whether at sea or in port, at its usual time or exceptionally within a period not exceeding twenty-four hours beyond that time. He must be accommodated in a separate lodging completely independent of the lodgings of other crew members.
