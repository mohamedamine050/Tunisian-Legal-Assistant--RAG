## English Translation:

**Registration** is the act by which the maritime authority registers a sailor in the ship's crew logbook. This process takes place at the offices of the maritime authority upon the captain's submission of a list of the sailors hired to work on board his vessel, along with their employment contracts. The list contains each sailor's name, surname, nationality, place and date of birth, address, type of work on board the ship, and registration number. Each sailor, except for those embarking on their first voyage, must be accompanied by their logbook or an identity document, as well as a medical certificate or medical exemption issued by the maritime authority as stipulated in Article 20 of this Code, if required. A copy of the **contract** signed by the maritime authority is attached to the copy of the crew logbook delivered to the captain. 

**Contract** refers to a legally binding agreement that obliges the contracting parties and defines their obligations and rights concerning the specific transaction.
