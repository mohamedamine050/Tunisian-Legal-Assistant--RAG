Seafarers working on vessels not engaged in coastal navigation are entitled to food throughout the duration of their registration in the crew register. It is required that such vessels have a cook who is qualified and over eighteen years of age. If the crew exceeds twenty individuals, the cook may not be removed from their position to be assigned to another role on board the vessel. Regarding vessels engaged in coastal navigation, the matter of food remains subject to local customs.
