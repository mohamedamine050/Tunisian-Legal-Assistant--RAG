If, after the ship's logbook is closed, two crew members are missing, the captain may exceptionally, and upon verification, undertake their replacement up to a quarter of the crew's total number, without the intervention of the maritime authority, while observing the established procedures. The captain must notify the maritime authority of the names of the crew members who embarked the ship before departure. The entries in the ship's logbook must be amended upon arrival at the first port where a representative of the maritime authority is present.
