A seaman, if he observes the time limit stipulated in Article 33, may request the termination of the **contract** of employment for failure of the supplier to comply with an obligation. The seaman's right to terminate the **contract** of employment shall not be subject to any form of appeal:

(1) If the last day of the notice period falls after the time set by the ship preparing to sail for the commencement of work according to the quarter-day system, with the intention to set sail. However, the seaman cannot be deprived of his right to leave work 24 hours before the scheduled departure time, unless there are unforeseen and legally justifiable reasons.

(2) If the last day of the notice period falls after the time set by the ship's master upon arrival at the port for the end of work according to the quarter-day system. However, the seaman cannot be deprived of his right to leave work 24 hours after the ship's arrival at its port of destination, unless there are unforeseen and legally justifiable reasons. Nevertheless, the maritime authority, upon finding compelling reasons and after investigation, may permit the seaman to disembark immediately.
