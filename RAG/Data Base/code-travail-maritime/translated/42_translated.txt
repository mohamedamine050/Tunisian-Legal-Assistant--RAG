Any unjustified delay by the seaman in joining his work aboard the vessel on the designated day and time may be considered by the employer as a legal ground for terminating the contract of employment. The contract is a legally binding agreement that obliges the contracting parties and defines their obligations and rights in relation to the specific transaction.

If the seaman fails to join the vessel due to force majeure or an emergency event three hours before the vessel sets sail, he may be compensated, but he is entitled to a penalty of three days' wages.  Failure to join the vessel during the voyage without permission constitutes a legal ground for termination. This is also the case if the seaman fails to join the vessel upon its departure, even if this occurs in a foreign country.
