Every creditor holding an executory instrument or a registered instrument with a due date for the payment of his debt may, by means of one of the executive bailiffs, serve his debtor with a notice informing him that in the event of non-payment of the debt, he will proceed to apply for the registration of an **opposition**. 

**Opposition** is a remedy available to the defaulting party to challenge a decision taken against him in absentia.

Creditors who do not hold an executory instrument or a registered instrument, or whose debt has not matured but whose collection is threatened by seizure, may apply for the registration of an **opposition** to secure their debtor's aircraft after obtaining authorization from the President of the **Court of First Instance** in Tunisia. The registration of the **opposition** must be effected within a maximum period of ninety days from the date of the notice referred to in the first paragraph or from the authorization referred to in the second paragraph of this article, failing which it shall be invalid. When refusing registration, the relevant departments of the Ministry responsible for civil aviation shall indicate, in the margin or at the bottom of the notice referred to in the first paragraph or the authorization referred to in the second paragraph above, the date of their contact with the debtor and the reason for refusing the registration. The registration shall become effective and, in all cases, shall lapse after a period of two years from the date of its execution. No **opposition** can be registered against an aircraft that is not liable to seizure.
