If the aircraft is registered in Tunisia, copies of the seizure warrant and the summons to appear, as referred to in Article 46 of this Code, shall be served within the same time limit: 1) to the Civil Aircraft Registration Office for the purpose of recording the seizure in the registration book. 2) to the registered creditors or those entitled to rescission or those who have entered a precautionary claim, so they may intervene in the case if they so wish. The originals of these copies shall be added to the file submitted to the Court, along with a list of the registrations carried on the aircraft. Any sale in violation of the provisions of this Article may be challenged by any person who suffers damage as a result, provided that they file a request to that effect within a period of six months from the date of the sale.
