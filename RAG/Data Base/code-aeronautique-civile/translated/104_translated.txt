Outside of areas subject to the servitude rights stipulated in Article 98 of this Code, all constructions that, due to their height, may constitute obstacles to air navigation are subject to prior authorization from the Minister in charge of civil aviation. This applies if these constructions exceed a height above ground level that is determined by a decision of the Minister in charge of civil aviation. The Minister in charge of civil aviation may authorize the removal or modification of any device that could cause confusion with visual aids for air navigation or that could be a source of glare for aircrews.
