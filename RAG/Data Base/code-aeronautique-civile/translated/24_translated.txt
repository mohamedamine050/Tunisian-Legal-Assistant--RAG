The mortgage may include spare parts that correspond to the type of aircraft subject to the mortgage. 

A mortgage is a contract by which a creditor acquires a real right over a property designated to satisfy his debt, which allows him to take precedence over ordinary creditors and creditors who rank below him in satisfying his right from the price of that property, in whatever hand it may be.

On condition that these parts are segregated and kept in one or several specific places and that a suitable notice is displayed on site by means of notices alerting third parties to the nature and scope of the right assigned to these parts and specifying the register in which the mortgage is registered, as well as the name and address of the creditor. The mortgage must be accompanied by an inventory indicating the nature and quantity of these parts. The term "spare parts" refers to the parts that make up the aircraft, engines, propellers, flight equipment, instruments, equipment, packaging, parts of different elements, and generally all other elements, regardless of their nature, kept to replace the parts making up the aircraft. Spare parts that have been used immediately must be replaced by similar parts without prejudice to the rights of the creditor.
