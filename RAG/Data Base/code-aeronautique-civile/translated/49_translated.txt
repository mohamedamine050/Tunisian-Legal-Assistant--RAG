The court shall order the sale after setting its terms and schedule the case for the hearing at which it will be conducted. The starting price shall be set by the reasonable creditor and the sale shall be effected for his benefit if no bidding occurs during the sale. This judgment is not subject to any form of appeal, even by way of cassation. However, the reasonable debtor may proceed with an amicable sale within a period of thirty days from the date of the judgment, in accordance with the forms provided for in this chapter. The reasonable debtor shall send a written notice to the judicial officer entrusted with the sale, informing him of the offers received, specifying the name and surname of the prospective purchaser, as well as the period within which he proposes to secure the purchase price. The judicial officer entrusted with the sale shall notify these details to the reasonable creditor as well as the objecting creditors by registered mail with acknowledgement of receipt. These creditors shall have a period of fifteen days to respond, and failure to respond shall be considered acceptance. If the reasonable creditor proves that the proposals are insufficient, the judicial officer shall proceed with the auction sale. Except in the case of non-consent to the sale with the intention of harming the reasonable debtor, the reasonable creditor shall not bear any liability. In all cases, the purchase price must be secured, and the ownership of the aircraft shall not be transferred or the aircraft delivered until such security is provided. If this is not done within the agreed period, the forced sale shall be executed upon the expiration of the thirty-day period stipulated for the amicable sale, plus, if necessary, the fifteen-day period allotted for the creditors to provide their responses.
