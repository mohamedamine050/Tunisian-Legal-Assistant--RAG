**Registration Preserves the Mortgage**

The official mortgage is a contract by which the creditor acquires a real right over a property designated to satisfy his debt. This right allows the creditor to take precedence over ordinary creditors and creditors who rank lower than him in the order of priority in recovering his right from the sale proceeds of the property, regardless of the hands it may be in. The registration is valid for a period of ten years from the date of its execution, and its effect terminates if it is not renewed before the end of the aforementioned period.
