Authorization is granted to conduct a precautionary seizure. 

A precautionary seizure is a temporary, preventive measure that safeguards a right from threats and the possibility of its non-recovery. This paves the way for the exercise of an enforcement seizure that empowers the creditor to sell the debtor's assets and recover their debt from the sale proceeds. It also allows the removal of the debtor's hands from the assets, as stipulated by the forms and deadlines provided in the Code of Civil Procedure in the chapter concerning authorizations on petitions. 

It may be a condition for granting authorization to conduct a precautionary seizure that the applicant provides a guarantor or a valid surety. The provision of a guarantor is mandatory if the applicant does not have a domicile in Tunisia on the day of the seizure. The court order authorizing the seizure shall specify the deadline within which the applicant must file their claim with the competent judge, which shall not exceed one month. If the claim is not filed within this period, the precautionary seizure shall be considered null and void, and the parties involved will be released from any obligations related to it.
