Aircraft are considered movable property. Every transfer of ownership by death and every judicial decision that transfers, establishes, or declares ownership is subject to registration in the Civil Aircraft Registry. Ownership shall only be proven by written instruments, and no one may challenge it unless it has been registered in the Civil Aircraft Registry.
