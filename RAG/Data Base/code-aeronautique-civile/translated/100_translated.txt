The external boundaries of airports are determined either through a delimitation process conducted in the presence of adjacent landowners or by the existence of the following bordering the airport: - either natural boundaries such as valleys. – or administrative boundaries if the airport is connected to public domain annexes such as roads, paths, and canals. – or for water bodies, the boundaries defined by means of markers such as signposts or arrangement. – or anything that marks a specific point on the ground. With regard to airports whose expansion has been decided upon, a plan for the expansion shall be prepared showing the boundaries at which the airport boundaries end. The zones specified in Article 99 shall also be delimited starting from the external boundaries of the airport shown in the expansion plan. The external boundaries of the facilities and areas specified in Article 98 of this Code shall be delimited in the same manner used to delimit the external boundaries of airports.
