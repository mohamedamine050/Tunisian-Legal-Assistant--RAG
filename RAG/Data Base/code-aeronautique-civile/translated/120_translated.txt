Documents known as "certificates" acknowledge a set of general theoretical and practical knowledge. These certificates are awarded upon successful completion of an examination and are acquired definitively. Documents known as "licenses" acknowledge the competence and right of the certificate holder to practice the relevant professions, provided that they possess the qualifications stipulated in Article 121 of this code. Licenses are valid for a limited period and can be renewed after periodic verification of the availability of the various required qualifications.
