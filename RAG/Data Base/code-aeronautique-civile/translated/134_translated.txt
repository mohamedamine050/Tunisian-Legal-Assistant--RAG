The aircraft commander shall immediately report to the nearest air traffic control service any incident or occurrence that relates to or could affect air safety, whether it occurred over land or in Tunisian airspace. If the aircraft commander is unable to report the incident to air traffic control, the latter shall report it through any crew member, or if that is not possible, through the aircraft operator or the nearest civilian or military authority. 

In such cases, the report shall be made to the Aircraft Accident and Incident Investigation Office of the Ministry responsible for civil aviation. This office shall be informed of any incident or occurrence that occurs outside Tunisian airspace involving an aircraft registered in Tunisia or operated by an operator holding an operating license issued by the Minister responsible for civil aviation. The procedures for the technical investigation shall be determined by order.
