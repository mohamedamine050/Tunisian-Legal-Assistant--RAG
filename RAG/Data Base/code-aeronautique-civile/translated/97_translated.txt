Specific easements known as "aerial easements" have been established to ensure the safety of air traffic and to limit the harm surrounding airports. These easements include: 
a) Aerial easements for clearance, which include the prohibition of the creation of obstacles and the obligation to remove them if they pose a danger to air traffic or cause harm to the operation of safety equipment installed for the benefit of air navigation.
b) Aerial easements for the placement of markings, which include the obligation to equip certain obstacles and certain areas with visual or radio-electric devices designed to indicate their presence or to be identified by air navigators, or to be suitable for the installation of these devices on them. 
c) Aerial easements to limit the harm around airports.
