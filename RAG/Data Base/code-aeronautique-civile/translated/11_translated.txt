**Certificate**

A person's sworn statement is often used as evidence in court.

A certificate of registration is issued to every owner of an aircraft registered in the Civil Aircraft Registry. The form of this certificate and the data it must contain are determined by a decision of the Minister responsible for civil aviation.
