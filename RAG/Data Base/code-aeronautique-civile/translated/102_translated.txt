Within areas subject to air servitude rights, a fine may be imposed, or authorization for the removal or alteration of constructions built from solid and permanent materials, as well as lightweight constructions, fences, plantings, and all other barriers that pose a danger to air navigation, or whose height exceeds the limit specified in Article 99 of this Code and were in existence before the establishment of the servitude right. If the authorization for removal or alteration includes constructions built from solid and permanent materials, expropriation shall be resorted to. In other cases, a fine shall be paid in accordance with applicable legislation.
