No person may perform the functions of an air traffic controller, aircraft maintenance mechanic, or technical exploitation assistant unless they hold a valid license and appropriate qualifications. The terms and conditions for issuing and withdrawing these licenses and qualifications are determined by a decision of the Minister responsible for civil aviation. Similar provisions may be applied to other categories of personnel.
