Alternatively, the aforementioned copy of the seizure warrant may be served upon the pilot of the aircraft in the defendant's absence or upon the person representing the defendant. If the defendant resides outside Tunisia, and the pilot of the aircraft is absent and there is no one to represent the defendant, the procedures set forth in Article 9 of the Code of Civil Procedure shall be followed.
