The privilege stipulated in Article 18 of this Act includes the aircraft or an insurance indemnity. 

An insurance contract is one in which the insurer undertakes to pay the insured or the beneficiary a sum of money, a regular income, or any other financial compensation in the event of the occurrence of the insured event, in return for premiums or any other financial payment made by the insured to the insurer.

This privilege follows the aircraft regardless of the hands to which it has passed. The privilege expires after three months from its origin, unless the creditor, within this period, registers his debt in the aircraft registration book, after the amount has been agreed upon by mutual consent, or in the event of the impossibility of filing a legal action in this regard.

The privilege also expires in the following cases:

A - The compulsory sale of the aircraft. B - The waiver of the creditor or creditors. C - The voluntary disposal of the aircraft, subject to the following conditions:

- That the registration of the deed of voluntary disposal is entered in the register of civil aircraft. - That the disposal is advertised in the official gazette of the Republic of Tunisia and in the daily newspapers published in Tunisia, twice, at least eight days apart. - That the creditor has not notified both the former owner and the new owner of his opposition during the month following the last advertisement.
