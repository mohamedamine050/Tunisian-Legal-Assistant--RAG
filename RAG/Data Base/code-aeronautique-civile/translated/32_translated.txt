This document establishes a formal mortgage agreement, by which the creditor acquires a real right in a property designated for the satisfaction of their debt. This right enables the creditor to take precedence over ordinary creditors and those with lower ranking claims in the recovery of their debt from the proceeds of the property, regardless of who holds it. 

The interest accrued for three years in addition to the current year enjoys a privilege of the same rank as the principal debt. The interest rate cannot exceed the legal rate unless it is explicitly stated in the deed of registration.
