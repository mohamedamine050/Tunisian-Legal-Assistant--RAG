A claim for entitlement or a claim for annulment shall be brought at least ten days before the designated date for the sale by a petition filed by a lawyer, including the date of the hearing before the Real Estate Property Court which ruled on the sale, and the documents relating to the annulment or entitlement, otherwise the right to bring the claim shall lapse. The lawyer of the applicant shall respond with a report within five days. The filing of these claims shall not suspend the sale procedures. The judgment may only be appealed by way of cassation, and a request for cassation must be filed within five days of the date of the judgment. The deadlines provided for in Articles 185 and 186 of the Code of Civil Procedure and Commercial Procedure shall be reduced by half. Claims for annulment filed after the deadline referred to in the first paragraph of this article shall be deemed null and void. Claims for entitlement filed after that deadline or after the sale has been finalized shall automatically become objections to the delivery of the proceeds of the sale and shall be considered during the distribution of the sale proceeds.
