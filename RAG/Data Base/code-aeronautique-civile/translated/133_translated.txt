In the event that an aircraft disappears and all communication is lost, it shall not be considered missing until three months have elapsed from the date of the last communication received. Upon the expiration of this period, a judicial declaration of death may be issued for the individuals on board the aircraft, at the request of any person having a right or obligation under the provisions of the Personal Status Code. The Minister in charge of Civil Aviation shall authorize the opening of an administrative investigation, not subject to any specific form, and shall issue a decision declaring the existence of evidence of the total loss of the aircraft. This decision shall be directed to the Public Prosecutor of the Republic, who shall take the necessary measures for the judicial inquest into the death.
