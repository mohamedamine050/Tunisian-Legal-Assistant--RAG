Aircraft mortgages are created only by agreement of the parties. A mortgage can be established as a formal contract by which the creditor, on an immovable property designated to fulfill their debt, acquires a real right that allows them to take precedence over ordinary creditors and creditors ranking lower in the order of priority in obtaining their rights from the sale proceeds of that property, regardless of who is in possession.

A mortgage may be applied to one aircraft or multiple aircraft owned by a single person. The aircraft or aircraft must be expressly identified, and the amount of the mortgage must be specified.
