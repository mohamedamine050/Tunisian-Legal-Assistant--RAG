No compulsory sale may be effected if it is anticipated that the sale price will not suffice to satisfy the creditors' rights which have been proven before the competent authority and which take precedence over the debts of the prudent creditor in accordance with the current legislation, or if the purchaser has not undertaken to satisfy them. The provisions of this chapter shall not apply to the compensation sought by those affected and those who have rights as a result of the damages caused by the aircraft on the ground, which were not insured for an amount equal to the value of the aircraft when new.
