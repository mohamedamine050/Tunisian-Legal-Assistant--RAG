The erasure of the official mortgage registration is a mechanism employed in real estate mortgages, with its legal system varying between registered and unregistered deeds.
The official mortgage registration is a contract that grants the creditor, against a property designated for the fulfillment of his debt, a real right, which entitles him to take precedence over ordinary creditors and creditors following him in order, in recovering his right from the proceeds of that property, wherever it may be.
It is effected through the submission of written documents signed by the creditor to release the property or by a court judgment with the force of res judicata. The erasure of the registration may only occur with the agreement of the parties. It must be noted in the civil aircraft registry 
regarding the erasure or modification of mortgage registrations.
