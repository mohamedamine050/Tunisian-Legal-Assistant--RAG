The Minister in charge of Civil Aviation may authorize the placement of illuminated markings, both day and night, or only at night, or only during the day, on all obstacles that are considered dangerous to air navigation. The model of the illuminated markings shall be set by a decision of the Minister in charge of Civil Aviation. The costs of installation and maintenance of the illuminated markings shall be borne by the State if the establishment of the right of way for the lighting is subsequent to the existence of the obstacles. These costs shall be borne by the user of the obstacles if the establishment of the right of way predates their existence. In all cases, the costs of installation and maintenance of the illuminated markings for electricity transmission lines shall be borne by the users of these lines. The State shall have the right to access, passage, cutting and trimming of trees, as well as the right to install devices on external walls and roofs for the purpose of installing the illuminated markings.
