Air transport institutions are subject to the supervision of the Minister responsible for Civil Aviation with regard to the application of the legislation in force, particularly concerning aviation personnel, the air fleet and its technical operation. This supervision is exercised both on the ground and in the air by qualified and sworn inspectors belonging to the departments concerned of the Ministry responsible for Civil Aviation, or by inspectors belonging to an institution authorized by the Minister responsible for Civil Aviation, or by inspectors appointed by decision of the Minister responsible for Civil Aviation, taking into account their competence and experience in the field of supervision. 

In the exercise of their duties, inspectors, upon presentation of their mission authorization, are authorized to board aircraft and access premises and structures. In the event of supervision during flight, these inspectors must, if necessary, be provided with a free travel ticket for the purpose. The costs of inspection activities are borne by the inspected institution. 

The conditions and methods of implementing this supervision are determined by a decision of the Minister responsible for Civil Aviation.
