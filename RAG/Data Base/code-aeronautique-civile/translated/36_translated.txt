A conservatory lien is any action taken to seize an aircraft for the benefit of a private interest pursuant to a judicial order issued either in favor of a creditor or in favor of the owner of a real right over the aircraft. The right of detention of aircraft without the consent of the operator is considered a conservatory lien. 

This conservatory lien, which empowers the creditor holding an enforceable instrument to place the movable property in the possession of his debtor under the authority of the court, is subject to the rules stipulated in this Code.
