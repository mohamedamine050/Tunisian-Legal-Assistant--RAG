**Loss of Nationality**

Nationality is a legal and political bond between an individual and a specific state, which includes the individual among its constituent population. Consequently, this bond establishes mutual rights and obligations between them.

Tunisian nationality may be lost without prejudice to the rights established for any aircraft registered in Tunisia that no longer meets the conditions stipulated in Article 4 of this Code or whose owner has registered it abroad.
