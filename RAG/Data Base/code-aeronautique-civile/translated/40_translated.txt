If the aircraft is not subject to any form of attachment or is not attachable, and the lessee does not assert this, the provision of sufficient security prevents the precautionary attachment, as well as the precautionary attachment.

**Precautionary Attachment**

Precautionary attachment is a preventive, temporary measure that preserves the right from threat and the possibility of being unable to obtain it. This serves as a prelude to the execution of the attachment, which enables the creditor to sell the debtor's assets and recover their debt from the proceeds. It also gives the right to lift the attachment. Security is considered sufficient if it covers the amount of the debt and expenses and is exclusively intended for the creditor's recovery, or if it covers the value of the aircraft if it is less than the amount of the debt and expenses.
