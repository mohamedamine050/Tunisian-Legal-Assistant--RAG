A mortgage,  a formal contract by which a creditor acquires a real right over a property dedicated to the satisfaction of his debt, enabling him to take precedence over ordinary creditors and creditors ranking after him in the order of priority in collecting his right from the price of that property in whatever hands it may be, is not valid unless it is in writing, otherwise it is considered void. All elements upon which the mortgage is based must be clearly stated.
A mortgage can be endorsed, and in this case, the endorsement results in the transfer of the rights of the mortgagee.
