The registration fee is calculated on the share of real and personal property, provided that the shareholding status is proven on the net amount of the assets subject to the partition. This is done after deducting the values subject to the registration fee from the differences in shares and surpluses of the value of the appurtenances related to the real estate. The same rules relating to the sale of these properties apply to the differences in shares and surpluses of the value of the appurtenances related to the real estate. In the event that the differences in shares and surpluses of the value of the appurtenances are not specifically attached to the category of personal or real estate, the registration fee is applied according to the rate specific to the sale of real estate, based on the relative value of these assets within the share to which the differences in shares or surpluses of the value of the appurtenances belong.
