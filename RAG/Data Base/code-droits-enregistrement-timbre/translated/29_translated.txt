I.  Transfers of shares, founders' contributions, and surplus allocations in companies whose capital has not been divided into shares, occurring within two years of the contribution date to the company, as well as transfers of shares and allocations that grant their holders the right to use or own real estate or a part thereof, are considered transfers of the property represented by these securities. For the purpose of applying registration tax to these transfers, all rules relating to the sale of such property shall apply.  With respect to securities issued in exchange for contributions to the company, and for the purpose of determining the registration tax, each contribution element shall be assessed separately, stating the number of shares issued in exchange for each element. If these valuations and data are not available, the registration tax shall be determined according to the rate applied to the sale of real estate.

II. In the case of applying registration tax to a transfer of shares or allocations, the assignment of the property represented by these securities upon the dissolution of the company is not subject to registration tax unless this assignment is made to a person other than the transferee.

III. (Added by Article 64 of Law No. 123 of 2001, dated December 28, 2001) The provisions of this chapter apply to transactions carried out by economic interest groupings.
