Public, civil, and judicial contracts related to subletting, assignment of the lease, or lease transfer must explicitly state that the contract is a legally binding agreement obligating the contracting parties and defining their obligations and rights concerning the specific transaction.  The lease, partially or wholly assigned, has been registered.
