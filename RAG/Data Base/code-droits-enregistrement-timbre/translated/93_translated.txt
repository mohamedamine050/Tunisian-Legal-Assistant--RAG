Each party to a contract, a contract being a legally binding agreement that obligates the contracting parties and defines their obligations and rights concerning the specific transaction, or a declaration subject to mandatory registration, must state within the contract or declaration submitted for registration their tax identification number, national identity card number, or passport number. This applies to contracting parties who are not eligible for a national identity card.  If the financial collector omits this, they must request the parties to specify this information at the bottom of the contract, declaration, judgment, or decision, signed and witnessed as accurate.  The court clerk, a judicial officer responsible for maintaining records and managing court documents, must specify, within the summary of the judgment or decision stipulated in Article 15 of this Code, the data stipulated in the first paragraph of this Article for each of the litigating parties. (Amended by Article 87 of Law No. 53 of 2015 dated 25/12/2015 and by Article 69, paragraph 5 of Law No. 78 of 2016 dated 17/12/2016).

For contracts and writings subject to registration with the land registry, the registration procedure requires that the pages of the contract or writings be numbered. (Added by Article 86 of Law No. 90 of 2004 dated 31/12/2004).
