Taking into account the special provisions contained in this Code, the registration fee levied on the sale of real estate and similar transactions, or levied on the public sale of movable property, is calculated on the price agreed upon by the contracting parties, whether it exceeds or falls short of the declared value, with the addition of expenses in the form of capital.  In the event of a re-tender due to default or an increase in the price exceeding the price agreed upon by the contracting parties, whether it exceeds or falls short of the declared value, the price of the first tender on which the fee was levied shall be deducted.
