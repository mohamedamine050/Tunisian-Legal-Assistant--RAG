I - The nominative securities of companies belonging to an estate cannot be transferred or exchanged except after the presentation of a certificate, issued free of charge by the Financial Receiver, attesting either to the payment of the registration fee on the estate or to the non-liability for this fee.  II - When the transfer or exchange occurs for the purpose of, or on the occasion of, the trading of securities, the certificate of the Financial Receiver referred to in the first paragraph of this chapter may be replaced by a declaration from the parties, specifying precisely the securities concerned by the trading and indicating that their transfer occurred for the purpose of paying the registration fees levied on estates and that the proceeds of the transfer will be paid directly by the intermediary of the transaction to the Financial Receivership, to which the declaration must be submitted.
