The employee registration fee is waived for the deceased's principal residence when transferred between ascendants and descendants or between spouses, provided that the heirs submit a certificate from the competent governor or mayor certifying that the property in question was the deceased's principal residence. This waiver is granted for an area up to 1000 square meters, including built and unbuilt annexes.  Any area exceeding this limit remains subject to the employee registration fee on inheritances.
