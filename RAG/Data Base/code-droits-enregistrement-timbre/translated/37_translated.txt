The registration fees levied on gifts and inheritances are calculated on:

1. Immovable and movable property located in Tunisia, regardless of the residence of the deceased or the donor.
2. Immovable and movable property, whether located in Tunisia or abroad, if the deceased or the donor was resident in Tunisia.  The aforementioned fees are exempted for immovable and movable property located abroad that has been subject to registration fees on gifts and inheritances in the country where it is located. For the application of the aforementioned provisions, residents of Tunisia are considered to be persons who have a main residence there, or persons who reside there continuously or intermittently for a period of not less than 183 days during the 365 days preceding the date of death or gift. (Amended by Article 76 of Law No. 90 of 2004, dated 31/12/2004).
