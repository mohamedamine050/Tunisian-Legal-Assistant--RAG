Registration fees levied on inheritances are calculated based on the principal debt stipulated in the contract, for debts and other contracts involving financial obligations. However, for debts where the debtors are in bankruptcy or provisional settlement upon the opening of the inheritance, the fees are calculated based on the parties' estimated declaration.  Any additional amount collected from the debtor after the assessment of the estimated declaration must be the subject of a supplementary declaration.  All rules generally applicable to inheritance declarations, particularly those concerning penalties, fines, and prescription, apply to this supplementary declaration. The supplementary declaration must be filed, and the required fees paid, within ninety days of the date of collection of the inherited debt or part thereof.
