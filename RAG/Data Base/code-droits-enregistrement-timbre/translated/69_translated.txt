The judgments and decisions, as well as the contents, copies, and executive or summary copies issued from these judgments and decisions, resulting from cases heard before the Family Grants Judge, shall be registered with payment deferred.  These documents must explicitly state that they are prepared in accordance with the legal provisions relating to the competent court in matters of family grants. However, if the parties, in support of their claims, present writings that are required to be registered but are not registered, the Family Grants Judge is obligated to immediately authorize their deposit in writing, which shall be immediately submitted for registration to the competent financial collector.
