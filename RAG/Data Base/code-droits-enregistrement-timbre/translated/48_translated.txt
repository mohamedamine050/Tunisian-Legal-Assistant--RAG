I. The debts claimed shall be specified item by item, with a statement of an inventory whose accuracy is attested to by the depositor, attached to the declaration. II. If the debt is the subject of an official instrument or a judgment, the heirs or their representatives must indicate the date of that instrument or judgment, as well as the name and address of the public official who drew up the instrument or the court that rendered the judgment.  For debts included among the liabilities of bankruptcy or a settlement, it suffices to state the date of the declaration of bankruptcy or the approval of the settlement, as well as the date of the record of proceedings for monitoring, securing debts, or final settlement of distribution by contribution. III. When the debt is not the subject of an official instrument, the parties are required to submit the instrument itself or a copy thereof, certified as conforming to the original. If the original instrument is not in their possession at the time of the declaration of the estate, they must, for this purpose, contact the creditor, who cannot, without incurring liability for damages, refuse to provide them with the instrument or a certified copy thereof in exchange for a receipt. IV. In all cases, the tax administration may request from the heir a certificate issued by the creditor attesting to the existence of the debt upon the opening of the estate. The delivery of this certificate cannot be refused; otherwise, a fine will be imposed for the benefit of the applicant whenever the request is legitimate. Every creditor attesting to the existence of a debt must expressly state that he has been informed of the penalties provided for in paragraph three of Article 105 of this Code concerning false testimony.
