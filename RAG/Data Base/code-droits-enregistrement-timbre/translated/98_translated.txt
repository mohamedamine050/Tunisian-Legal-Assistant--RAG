No purchaser of real estate or commercial property located in Tunisia and belonging to an estate belonging to an heir or several heirs, or gifted or bequeathed to them, whose actual or legal residence is abroad, may renounce the purchase price unless they provide a certificate issued free of charge by the tax collector, attesting either to the payment of registration fees on the estate or to the non-applicability of this fee.  Unless the purchaser chooses to retain, as a guarantee for the rights of the Public Treasury, an amount equal to the fee levied on the purchase price until the aforementioned certificate is provided.
