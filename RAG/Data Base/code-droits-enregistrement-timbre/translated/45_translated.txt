I. The registration fee levied on inheritances shall be calculated on all sums, income, or various proceeds due from the insurer because of or upon the death of the insured, taking into account the degree of kinship.

In calculating the degree of direct kinship, each branch is considered one degree when ascending to the origin, upon leaving this origin. When calculating the degree of indirect kinship, the degrees are counted upwards from the branch to the common origin and then downwards from it to the other branch; each branch, except the common origin, is considered one degree.

This applies between the beneficiary of these sums free of charge and the insured, even if the latter did not personally conclude the insurance contract.  A contract is a legally binding agreement that obliges the contracting parties and defines their obligations and rights with respect to the specific transaction.  In it, the insurer undertakes to pay the insured or the beneficiary a sum of money, a regular income, or any other monetary compensation in the event of the occurrence of the insured event, in exchange for premiums or any other financial payment made by the insured to the insurer. However, this fee shall not be levied on sums paid by the insurer relating to premiums paid personally and definitively borne by the beneficiary, nor on sums received by the beneficiary in consideration in any capacity whatsoever.  If the person benefiting from the insurance grants all or part of his rights to a third party without consideration after the death of the insured, the donee shall in this case be considered the direct beneficiary of the insurance contract.
