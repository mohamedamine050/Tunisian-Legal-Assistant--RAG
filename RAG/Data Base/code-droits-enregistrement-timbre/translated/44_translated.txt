For the calculation and payment of registration fees levied on inheritances, properties of whatever nature are valued at their market value on the date of death, based on the parties' valuation statement (Article 65-1-7-6). However, if the transferred properties are the subject of a written judgment issued by the court resolving a legal issue or fact within two years following the death, or a written document issued by the parties within the same period, then the fees due cannot be calculated on an amount less than the market value stated in the judgment or document unless it is proven that the properties underwent modifications during the same period that would alter their value.
