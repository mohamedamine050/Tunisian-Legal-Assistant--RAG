I. Registration fees for perpetual or life annuities and capital payments are calculated based on the constituted capital, regardless of the price agreed upon by the contracting parties, whether it exceeds or falls short of the price stipulated for its consumption.  If the capital of the annuities or payments is not specified upon the conclusion of the contract, the fee base shall be determined based on the constituted capital calculated as twenty times the annual perpetual income and ten times the annual life income or annual payment, regardless of the price agreed upon by the contracting parties, whether it exceeds or falls short of the price stipulated for its consumption. II. For the purpose of determining the fee base stipulated in the first paragraph of this section, no distinction is made between life annuities or payments constituted for the benefit of one or more individuals.
