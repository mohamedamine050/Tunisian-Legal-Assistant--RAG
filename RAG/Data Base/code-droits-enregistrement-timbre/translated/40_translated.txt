I. Subject to the provisions of paragraph 2 of this chapter and for the purpose of calculating and paying registration fees levied on inheritances, the value of movable property shall be determined based on the detailed and estimated declaration of the parties concerned. However, with respect to furniture, and without the administration being obliged to prove its existence, the value subject to fees cannot be less than 5 percent of the gross value of the other inherited assets, unless otherwise proven.

II. The value determined in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1 of this chapter cannot be less than:

1. The price agreed upon by the contracting parties, even if it exceeds or falls short of the sale price, as stipulated in public sale contracts, provided that these sales took place within two years of the date of death.

2. The valuation mentioned in insurance contracts in force at the time of death and concluded by the deceased, their spouse, or their heirs less than five years prior to the date of opening the inheritance, unless otherwise proven. This valuation shall be used in the absence of a public sale. This procedure does not apply to insurance contracts relating to injuries, animals, and goods.

3. The valuation included in inventory statements prepared in accordance with the law within two years of the date of death, or any other document issued during the same period, in the absence of a public sale or insurance contract.
