Notaries, enforcement officers, court clerks, and other public officials cannot deliver an original, copy, or duplicate of a contract or a judgment subject to registration but not yet registered, nor can they execute another contract in lieu thereof, failing which they shall be personally liable for the payment of fees.  The provisions of the first subparagraph of this article do not apply to service records and similar contracts notified between the parties or via postings or announcements, as well as negotiable instruments and the subject matter of these instruments. However, public officials are authorized to execute contracts based on unregistered handwritten contracts, referencing them in their contracts, provided that each handwritten contract is attached to the contract referencing it and both are submitted simultaneously for registration. In this case, these officials shall be personally liable for the payment of fees and penalties applicable to these contracts.  A contract is a legally binding agreement that obligates the contracting parties and defines their obligations and rights concerning the specific transaction. A judgment is a written decision of a court that resolves a legal issue or question of fact.
