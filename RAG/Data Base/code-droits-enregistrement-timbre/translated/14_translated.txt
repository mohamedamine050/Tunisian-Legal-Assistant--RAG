I - The process of collection is the process by which a creditor obtains payment of a financial debt contracted by his debtor.  Registration fees on the contracts referred to in Article 56(1) of this Code shall be collected obligatorily by the first notary immediately after the execution of the contract. This collection shall be subject to the delivery of a receipt issued by the notary from a book of detachable receipts provided to him free of charge by the tax administration.

II - For other contracts not referred to in Article 56(1) of this Code, the first notary is required to prepare, obligatorily and on the date of their execution, a card in duplicate, detached from a book of receipts provided to him free of charge by the administration. This card must accurately reflect the agreements reached between the parties and must include all the data necessary for the calculation and collection of registration fees, particularly the original ownership, the price, and the date of payment of registration fees relating to the previous transfer. With regard to exchanges and donations, he must provide an assessment of the lesser value of the object of the exchange or the property transferred and, where necessary, indicate the complementary difference or added value. The first notary shall deliver a copy of this card immediately upon its preparation to the party required to pay the fees, and the second copy shall be delivered to the financial receiver at the same time as the statements referred to in Article 88(2) of this Code.
