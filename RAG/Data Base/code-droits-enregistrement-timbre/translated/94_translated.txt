Every person who habitually buys real estate or commercial assets for the purpose of resale, or who acts as an intermediary in such transactions, must maintain two bound registers.  In these registers, all authorizations, promises to sell, and contracts transferring ownership, and in general, all contracts related to his profession, must be recorded day by day without any blank spaces or gaps between the lines, and according to sequential numbering. One register shall be dedicated to intermediation transactions, and the other to purchase-for-resale transactions.
