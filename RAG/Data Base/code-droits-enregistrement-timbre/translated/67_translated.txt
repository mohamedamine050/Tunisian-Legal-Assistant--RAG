Financial receivers cannot postpone the registration of contracts and transfers for which the prescribed fees have been paid under the current legislation, regardless of the reason, even if it involves recourse to verification procedures.  This applies even for the purpose of settling debts and distributing assets in the event of bankruptcy.  Financial receivers may request a certified copy of the contracts submitted to them. In case of refusal, they may retain the contract for 24 hours to obtain a certified copy; the expenses incurred thereby shall be reimbursed to the financial receiver upon payment of registration fees.
