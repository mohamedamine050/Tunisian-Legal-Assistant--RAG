For the purpose of calculating and paying the registration fee levied on estates, debts outstanding against the deceased and legally justified on the date of the opening of the estate, supported by documents admissible before the court against the deceased, shall be deducted.  If the matter concerns commercial debts, the administration may require verification with the deceased's commercial records; otherwise, it may refuse to deduct these debts.  If the matter concerns a debt related to an estate where ownership is granted to one person and the right of usufruct to another, the registration fee shall be levied on the assets of the estate after deduction of the amount of the debt, in accordance with the provisions of Article 38 of this Code. The administration has the right to obtain information enabling it to verify the accuracy of the declared assets belonging to the estate, through the documents and records submitted for the purpose of claiming deductions.  In litigation, the submission of these documents or records cannot be refused.
