Judgments issued in criminal matters, in cases involving a private right of action, are recorded with deferred payment if requested by the Public Prosecution.  The Public Prosecution is the body responsible for defending the interests of society and applying the law before the courts. In this case, the relative amount due is collected from the convicted party. The convicted party is a defendant against whom a judgment has been rendered, determining their responsibility for a crime and imposing a penalty or precautionary measure.  The judgment is final, including costs.
