For the purpose of recovery;

Recovery is the process by which a creditor obtains payment of the financial debt contracted by his debtor.

Regarding registered assets, only the sums, securities, and objects found in a safe deposit box rented to several persons simultaneously are considered joint property of these persons.  A full share thereof shall be added to the estate unless proven otherwise. This procedure applies to sealed envelopes and closed boxes deposited with banks, money changers, or any person who habitually receives such envelopes.
