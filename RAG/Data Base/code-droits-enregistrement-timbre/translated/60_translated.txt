In the case referred to in the second paragraph of Article 6 of this Code, the declarant is required to pay the principal amount of the dues owed, while retaining his right to bring an action against the grantee to recover these dues.  An action is a legal procedure initiated by a claimant before a court against another party, which may be an individual or a private entity, in which the claimant demands a right or compensation for a loss caused by the other party.
