The parties in cases shall be jointly and severally liable to the public treasury for the payment of registration fees due on judicial judgments. However, the claimant shall be solely liable for the fees and penalties due if the judgment or decision completely rejects their claim.  The parties against whom costs are awarded shall also be solely liable for registration fees if the judgment or decision grants an allowance, maintenance, income, or compensation for damages in the matter of accidents.
