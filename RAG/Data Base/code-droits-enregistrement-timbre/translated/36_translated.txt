Judgments and decisions ordering conviction or  liquidation—the process of settling debts and distributing assets in bankruptcy—are registered with the minimum information stipulated in Article 22 of this Code.  If submitted for registration by parties not ordered to bear the costs. (Amended by Article 69, paragraph 4, of Law No. 78 of 2016 dated 17/12/2016)

For this purpose, the court clerk—a judicial official responsible for maintaining court records and managing court documents—must certify the summary record of the judgment or decision provided to the party not ordered to bear the costs.  The certification must state that the registration was requested by the latter. A judgment or decision registered with the minimum information is considered unregistered with respect to the parties ordered to bear the costs, who may only receive it after paying the balance of fees. In this regard, the duties and penalties applicable to court clerks regarding the delivery of enforceable copies and summaries, as stipulated in the first sub-paragraph of Article 86 of this Code, apply. The amount collected in accordance with the provisions of the first sub-paragraph of this Article is deducted from the fees claimed from the parties ordered to bear the costs. (The first paragraph amended by the provisions of Article 1 of Law No. 19 of 1997 dated 22/3/1997) concerning the registration of judgments and decisions with minimum information for parties awarded in their favor.
