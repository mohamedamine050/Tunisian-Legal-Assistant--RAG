The registration fee levied on the rental of real estate and commercial assets is calculated based on the rental price stipulated in the contract or declaration, plus any charges imposed on the lessee.  If the lease term stipulated in the contract is implicitly renewable, the total lease term is considered. However, in all cases, the registration fee cannot be applied to an amount exceeding the annual rental price plus any charges imposed on the lessee.
