Section IV

Judgments and Decisions

I. The registration fee is calculated on judgments and decisions based on the amount of the judgments of conviction or liquidation awarded. II. If the proportional fee is paid on a judgment or written decision of a court resolving a legal or factual issue, the recovery—the process by which the creditor obtains payment of the debt owed to them—of this fee on judgments and decisions that may be issued regarding this initial judgment by the Court of Appeal only applies to amounts exceeding the amount of conviction or liquidation initially awarded.  However, if the judgment or decision issued by the Court of Appeal specifies an amount of conviction or liquidation less than the amount initially awarded, then what was recovered in excess shall be refunded, in accordance with Articles 74 and 75 of this Code. III. The fee referred to in the first paragraph of this section is not applied if the judgment or decision represents a deed of transfer, whether for consideration or without consideration, of real estate, commercial assets, or a right in clientele. IV. When judgments and decisions do not require the application of the proportional fee, they are subject to the minimum recovery amount stipulated in Article 22 of this Code. V. Judgments and decisions relating to the determination of expropriation compensation and issued within the framework of expropriation operations for the public interest are subject to the minimum recovery amount stipulated in Article 22 of this Code (added by Article 66 of Law No. 101 of 1999 dated 31/12/1999 and amended by Article 65 of Law No. 27 of 2012 dated 29/12/2012 and by Article 4 of Article 69 of Law No. 78 of 2016 dated 17/12/2016).

VI. The applicable proportional fee for rent is applied to judgments and decisions recognizing the lessee's right to rent or determining its value. The proportional fee applicable to partitions is applied to judgments and decisions concerning the partition of movable property belonging to an estate or the assets of a company, or concerning the partition of real estate. (Added by Article 63 of Law No. 101 of 2002 dated 17/12/2002).
