No safe deposit box, or any part thereof, rented by a deceased lessee, or a partner in the lease, or their equivalent, may be opened by anyone except in the presence of the competent judge summoned for this purpose by the heirs.  The judge shall, three days prior, send notification by registered mail with acknowledgment of receipt, specifying the place, date, and time of the opening of the safe deposit box.  Notification shall also be sent to the relevant Performance Monitoring Center responsible for the location of the safe deposit box to enable its presence during the opening. A record of the inspection of the opening of the safe deposit box shall be drawn up, including a complete and detailed inventory of all securities, sums of money, and all items contained within the box, regardless of their type.
