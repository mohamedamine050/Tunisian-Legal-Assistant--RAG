When optional, the payment of stamp duty is subject to a tax license declaration from the tax administration, which may be revoked and shall automatically terminate whenever the operator changes (amended by Article 96 of Law No. 80 of 2003, dated 29/12/2003). The license is granted upon an application submitted to the competent performance monitoring center.  The application must contain the applicant's commitment to comply with the conditions imposed by this legislation. The applicant designates the person who took the initiative to begin the legal proceedings.
