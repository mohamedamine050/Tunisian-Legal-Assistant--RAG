Insurance contracts are subject to the provisions of the contract.  The contract is a binding legal agreement that obligates the contracting parties and defines their obligations and rights concerning the specific transaction.  Therein, the insurer undertakes to pay the insured or the beneficiary a sum of money, a periodic income, or any other financial compensation in the event of the occurrence of the insured event, in exchange for premiums or any other financial payment made by the insured to the insurer. This includes contracts concluded with insurance institutions, including Takaful institutions, regardless of where they are concluded, for information known as "sole information on insurance".  This is specified in Article 1 of Chapter 15 of Law No. 78 of 2019 dated December 23, 2019.
