I - Judges may not issue judgments based on unregistered contracts. This obligation does not apply to contracts designated by the competent tax collector as not subject to registration for a specific period.  II - In the event that unregistered contracts, without a notation from the tax collector indicating exemption from registration fees, are presented before the court, the judge assigned to the case, either at the request of the Public Prosecutor or sua sponte, shall order their deposit with the court registry for immediate forwarding to the competent tax collector for registration.
