The tax administration deposits the tax stamp forms.  Public funds collected by the State take the form of payments, and a payment is a cash sum paid by individuals and companies in proportion to their income or profits.  The used movable property is deposited with the records of the local courts and primary courts, and a proc√®s-verbal is drawn up without costs.
