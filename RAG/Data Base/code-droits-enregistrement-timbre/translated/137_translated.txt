With respect to promissory notes and all other registered contracts subject to stamp duty, mentioned in a public, judicial, or extrajudicial contract, which are not necessarily presented to the collector upon registration of the contract in which they are mentioned, the public official is required to explicitly state in the contract whether stamp duty has been applied to the instrument or contract in accordance with the law, specifying the amount collected.
