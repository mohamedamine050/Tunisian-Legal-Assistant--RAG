A committee, officially designated as the "Regional Reconciliation Committee," has been established in each regional performance monitoring center. This committee is formed by formally bringing together individuals with relevant expertise from various parts of the institution.  It is responsible for rendering opinions on tax review files.  Public funds are those collected by the state in the form of contributions; a contribution is a monetary sum paid by individuals and companies proportionally to their income or profits. This applies to preliminary, in-depth, or limited reviews before the issuance of a compulsory recruitment decision.
