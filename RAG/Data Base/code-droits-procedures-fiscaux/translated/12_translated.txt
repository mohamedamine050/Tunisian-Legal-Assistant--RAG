Officers of the tax and customs services, and other qualified state officers authorized to observe traffic violations, are responsible for conducting the necessary monitoring to verify compliance with legislation concerning invoices, the transport of materials and goods, and the payment of dues levied on road transport vehicles. Tax officers carry out monitoring on public roads, in establishments open to the public, and other places they may legally enter.  The role of other officers is limited to monitoring on public roads.
