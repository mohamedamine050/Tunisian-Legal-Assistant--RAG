Courts may authorize the publication of judgments or decisions they issue in tax matters.

State revenues are collected in the form of payments, which are monetary sums paid by individuals and companies proportionately to their income or profits.

Publication may be ordered against individuals subject to similar judgments or decisions within the five years preceding the issuance of the judgment or decision. Publication may include the judgment, decision, or excerpts thereof in the Official Gazette of the Tunisian Republic and a daily newspaper designated by the Court President, as well as the posting of the judgment, decision, or excerpts thereof for thirty days on the exterior door of the main professional premises of the offender and its branches. Publication is effected by a written court judgment or decision resolving a legal or factual issue.  Judgments or decisions are at the expense of the claimant.  Similar judgments or decisions are considered to be:

- Judgments and decisions issued on the basis of payment following a compulsory levy decision based on previously amended grounds, subject to a written court judgment or decision resolving a legal or factual issue.

- Judgments and decisions issued concerning criminal tax offenses against a person previously subject to a written court judgment or decision resolving a legal or factual issue concerning a tax offense.

Crimes punishable by death or imprisonment exceeding five years are described as felonies under this law.  Crimes punishable by imprisonment exceeding fifteen days but not exceeding five years, or a fine exceeding sixty dinars, are described as misdemeanors.  Crimes punishable by imprisonment not exceeding fifteen days or a fine not exceeding sixty dinars are described as offenses. (Article 122 of the Code of Criminal Procedure).
