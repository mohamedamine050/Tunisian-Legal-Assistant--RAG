The Public Prosecutor's Office, the body responsible for defending the interests of society and applying the law before the judicial courts, shall forward to the tax authorities all information and documents that may suggest the commission of tax fraud in relation to the public funds collected by the state in the form of payments.  A payment is a cash amount paid by individuals and companies proportionally to their income or profits.  This includes any act aimed at tax fraud or evasion of payment, whether it concerns a civil or commercial case, or a criminal investigation, even if this investigation concludes with the dismissal of the case.
