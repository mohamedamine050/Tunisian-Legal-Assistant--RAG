Non-resident natural persons, non-resident and non-established legal persons, persons operating within a permanent establishment in Tunisia, and resident foreigners changing their residence outside Tunisia must present a certificate attesting to the settlement of their tax situation.

Tax refers to the funds collected by the state in the form of taxes, a tax being a monetary amount paid by individuals and companies proportionally to their income or profits.

A certificate, issued by the competent tax authorities based on an application according to a model prepared by the administration, specifying the type of income concerned, is required when:

- Requesting a certificate.
- Changing residence.
- Exporting personal belongings or equipment.
- Transferring income or profits subject to tax under the legislation in force.  A certificate attesting to the settlement of the tax situation is required.

Tax refers to the funds collected by the state in the form of taxes, a tax being a monetary amount paid by individuals and companies proportionally to their income or profits.

The certificate mentioned in the first paragraph of this article is not required for residents in Tunisia liable to withholding tax on income exempted from tax when transferring said income to non-resident and non-established persons. However, the certificate mentioned in the previous paragraph is not required in the case of transferring income or profits exempt from tax under the legislation in force or under special agreements, provided that the type of income or profit is specified in the transfer application and the legal basis for its exemption.  It is outside the scope of tax provided that the legal basis is specified in the transfer application; if it has been subject to withholding tax under the legislation in force, a certificate attesting to the calculation of withholding tax on the income or profits must be provided.


The transfer application must be based on the rates stipulated in the Tax Code on the income of natural persons and corporate tax, by non-residents within the meaning of the law.  This is conditional upon providing the Tunisian Central Bank or approved intermediaries with a detailed monthly list including the identity of non-resident applicants for transfers abroad, the identity of the beneficiaries of the transferred amounts, their countries of residence, and the amounts transferred, and the withholding tax effected for the tax due in Tunisia.  The methods of implementing the provisions of this article shall be determined by order.
