Failure to declare, within the legal time limits, income and profits exempt from income tax, income tax withheld on total income or income elements, and corporate tax or tax subject to withholding at source, shall result in the application of a flat-rate penalty of 1% of the income and profits concerned.  This penalty shall apply to institutions benefiting from the total export tax system from the first day of the fourth month following the month in which the deadline for declaring income and profits expires. (This article was amended by Article 55 of Law No. 85 of 2006 dated December 25, 2006, relating to the Finance Act for 2007).
