Excess payments are refunded after deducting tax debts.  State revenues collected in the form of payments, whereby a payment is a cash sum paid by individuals and companies proportionally to their income or profits, are offset against the taxpayer's account held by the financial collector, even in case of a partial or total dispute regarding these debts.  The refund is made to the person who submitted the refund request or their successor.
