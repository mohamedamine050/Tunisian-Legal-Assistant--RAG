The in-depth review of the tax situation includes the assets collected by the state in the form of payments. A payment is a cash amount paid by individuals and companies proportionally to their income or profits.

The claim for payment, or part thereof, is based on accounting for claims requiring accounting records, and on information, documents, and factual and legal evidence in all cases.  The accounting required under tax law is not considered if not submitted to the tax authorities within thirty days of notification of the payment claims, using the methods stipulated in Article 10 of this Code, and a record is drawn up in accordance with Articles 70 to 72 of the same Code. This procedure does not apply to cases where the accounting is deposited with the courts or the Public Prosecutor's Office—the entity responsible for defending the interests of society and enforcing the law before the judicial courts—or public oversight bodies, or with experts appointed according to the law, or in the case of any other legal impediment, as well as in cases of force majeure. (This paragraph was added by Article 62 of Law No. 90 of 2004, dated December 31, 2004, concerning the Finance Law for 2005).

Tax authorities cannot conduct a further in-depth review for the same payment and the same period unless they obtain information affecting the basis and calculation of the payment, and which was not previously known to the administration.  Furthermore, following an in-depth tax review, the tax authorities cannot conduct a preliminary tax review for the same payment and the same period.
