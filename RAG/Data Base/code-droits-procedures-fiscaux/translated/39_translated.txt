In-depth reviews of tax situations are subject to prior notification.  State-collected funds take the form of payments, which are monetary amounts paid by individuals and companies proportionally to their income or profits.  Notification of payment demands shall be given according to the procedures stipulated in Article 10 of this Code (this paragraph was amended by Article 60 of Law No. 27 of 2012, dated December 29, 2012, relating to the Finance Law for 2013).  Notification of the in-depth review must include, in addition to the data relating to the review department and its seal, an explicit statement of the payer's right to be assisted during the review process and the discussion of its results by a person of their choice, or to appoint an agent to act on their behalf in accordance with the law.  The notification must also specify the payments and the period covered by the review, the officer(s) in charge, and the commencement date of the review, which must not be less than fifteen days from the date of notification. Notification is deemed to have occurred upon the signature of the party or their agent in the presence of the competent official, on a notification form or on the summons to appear at the appointed time. The fifteen-day period mentioned does not apply in the cases stipulated in the second paragraph of Article 32 of this Code (this paragraph was amended by Article 33 of Law No. 71 of 2009, dated December 21, 2009, relating to the Finance Law for 2010). The tax authorities may postpone the commencement of the review on their own initiative or at the written request of the payer for a maximum period of sixty days.
