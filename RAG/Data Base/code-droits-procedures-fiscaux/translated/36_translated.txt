The tax review may take the form of a preliminary review of declarations, contracts, and documents filed with the tax authorities, or a thorough review of the tax situation.  Tax assets are the funds collected by the state in the form of payments, and a payment is a cash amount paid by individuals and companies in proportion to their income or profits. This applies to claims for payment.
