The hearing shall be public unless the court hearing the case deems it necessary to hold it in camera, upon a reasoned request from the claimant or his legally appointed representative.  Tax authorities may not include in the case file documents containing precise information regarding the activities of persons who are not parties to the case; however, they may include information concerning them in the form of averages of the number of transactions, income, or profits, without identifying them. The procedure set forth in the second paragraph of this chapter shall not apply if the information is permitted to be published by law.
