Subject to the provisions of Article 25 of this Code, the right to pursue tax offenses lapses after three years from the date of their commission in the case of offenses incurring a financial penalty, and after five years from the date of their commission in the case of offenses incurring a financial penalty and a corporal punishment. (This paragraph was amended by Article 38 of Law No. 27 of 2012, dated December 29, 2012, relating to the Finance Law for 2013).  The statute of limitations is interrupted by the service of a report of the inspection of the offense.  Assets collected by the State in the form of payments—where payment is a cash amount paid by individuals and companies in proportion to their income or profits—are considered tax revenue.
