The claim for reimbursement shall be made by submitting a reasoned written request to the competent tax authorities in exchange for a receipt.  These authorities must respond to the reimbursement request within a maximum period of six months from the date of its submission. The response shall be reasoned in the event of a total or partial rejection of the reimbursement request.  Failure to respond within the time limit set forth in this section shall be considered an implicit rejection of the reimbursement request.
