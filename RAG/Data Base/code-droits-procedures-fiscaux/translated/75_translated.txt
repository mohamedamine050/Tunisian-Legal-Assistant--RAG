Tax officials may pursue criminal cases relating to the tax authorities to which they belong before the courts without requiring special authorization for this purpose.  They may also carry out procedures usually entrusted to bailiffs, or, for these procedures, resort to the services of Treasury bailiffs. The term "financial officers" has been replaced with "Treasury bailiffs" pursuant to Article 6 of Law No. 18 of 2012 dated September 25, 2012, concerning the amendment of certain provisions of the Public Accounting Code in order to create a special corps of Treasury bailiffs under the Ministry of Finance.
