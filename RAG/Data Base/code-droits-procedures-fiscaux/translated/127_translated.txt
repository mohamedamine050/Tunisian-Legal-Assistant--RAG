A committee was established by the Minister of Finance.  This advisory committee, officially constituted to bring together individuals with relevant expertise from various parts of the institution, is tasked with reviewing decisions on compulsory employment. This committee shall render opinions on petitions from claimants related to requests for reconsideration of compulsory employment decisions for which no judgment has been rendered originally due to the expiration of the objection period stipulated in Article 55 of this Code, or due to the formal rejection of the objection; provided that the petition for reconsideration is submitted no later than the end of the fifth year following the year in which the decision was served on the claimant. The tax authorities may, on their own initiative, submit the compulsory employment decisions referred to in this Article to the committee for consideration.
