The in-depth review of the tax situation of assets collected by the state in the form of payments—where payment is a cash amount paid by individuals and companies in proportion to their income or profits—is carried out at the institution's headquarters.  The review may also be conducted at the tax offices upon a written request from the institution or, if necessary, on the initiative of these offices. In this case, the ledgers and documents are delivered and returned against receipts. The maximum duration of the in-depth review of the tax situation of assets collected by the state in the form of payments—where payment is a cash amount paid by individuals and companies in proportion to their income or profits—is six months if the review is based on accounting compliant with current legislation, and one year in other cases.  The duration of the in-depth review is calculated from its start date, as included in the notification of the review, until notification of the results as stipulated in Article 43 of this Code. However, in case of delay in commencing the review, the actual commencement is recorded in a report drawn up in the manner stipulated in Articles 71 and 72 of this Code. For the calculation of this period, periods of interruption of the review due to reasons attributable to the taxpayer or at the initiative of the administration, and for which correspondence has taken place, are not taken into account, provided that the total interruption period does not exceed sixty days.  Also, the period of delay in submitting the accounting after the notification provided for in the first paragraph of Article 38 of this Code is not taken into account, provided it does not exceed 30 days, as well as the period of delay in submitting the documents justifying the transfer pricing policy after the notification provided for in Article 38 bis of this Code, provided it does not exceed 40 days. (This paragraph was amended by Article 47 of Law No. 78 of 2016 dated December 17, 2016, relating to the Finance Act for 2017, and by Article 35 of Law No. 56 of 2018 dated December 27, 2018, relating to the Finance Act for 2019). For the purpose of obtaining information from the competent authorities of countries linked to Tunisia by agreements relating to the exchange of information and administrative assistance in tax matters—where payment is a cash amount paid by individuals and companies in proportion to their income or profits—the tax authorities may, if necessary, extend the duration of the in-depth review of the tax situation of assets collected by the state in the form of payments for a maximum period of one hundred and eighty days. This period is not taken into account in calculating the maximum actual duration of the in-depth review or the total period of interruption of this review as stipulated in paragraph five of this Article. Before the expiry of the maximum review period, the tax authorities must inform the taxpayer of the extension.  They may also, if necessary, invite the taxpayer to resubmit their accounting to the investigators during the extension period, in accordance with the procedures stipulated in Article 10 of this Code. (This paragraph was added by Article 55 of Law No. 56 of 2018 dated December 27, 2018, relating to the Finance Act for 2019).
