Institutions linked by a relationship of dependency or control, as defined in the fourth paragraph of Article 48 septieme of the Code of Income Tax on Natural Persons and Corporate Tax, with institutions located outside Tunisia, may request the tax authorities to conclude a prior agreement concerning the method of determining the prices of transactions carried out with institutions linked to them by a relationship of dependency or control and located outside Tunisia, for a period ranging from three to five years.  The concluded agreement cannot be terminated before the expiry of the contractual period specified in the agreement. However, the agreement becomes void from the date of its entry into force if it is established that: the institution concerned provided false information or concealed information, failed to comply with the obligations stipulated in the agreement, or committed acts of fraud. The methods of concluding this agreement and its effects are determined by a decision of the Minister in charge of Finance.
