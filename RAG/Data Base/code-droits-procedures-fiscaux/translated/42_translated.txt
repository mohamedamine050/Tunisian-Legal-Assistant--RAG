The taxpayer may, during the tax review process, use the assistance of whomever they choose or appoint an agent to discuss its results.  State collected funds are in the form of payments; a payment is a cash sum paid by individuals and companies proportionately to their income or profits.  An agent is a person acting on behalf of another for this purpose in accordance with the law.
