Regardless of the deadlines stipulated in Articles 19 and 20 of this Code, periods covered by the statute of limitations may be reviewed.  Statute of limitations means the loss of the right to pursue a claim due to non-compliance with deadlines. If this review has an impact on the basis or amount of the payment due for periods not covered by the statute of limitations, particularly by deducting deferred losses or consumption, or surplus performance, the review cannot lead to a claim for additional payment for periods covered by the statute of limitations.
