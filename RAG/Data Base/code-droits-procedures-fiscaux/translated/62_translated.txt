Referral to an expert appraisal for the valuation of commercial real estate, real estate rights, and transferred commercial assets is mandatory for disputes concerning registration fees or income tax related to real estate capital gains.  The court may, otherwise, order an expert appraisal in matters before it, in accordance with the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure.  Experts shall deposit their reports with the court registry and shall directly deliver, against receipt, or through bailiffs, copies thereof to the tax authorities handling the file and to the claimants within forty-eight hours of the date of deposit. The court shall allow the tax authorities and claimants at least fifteen days from the date of receipt to submit their observations, reservations, and objections regarding the expert reports.  The expert appraisal provided for in this chapter does not include the recalculation of the amounts of payments and penalties levied or sought to be recovered, which remain subject to the provisions of Chapter 66 of this Code.
