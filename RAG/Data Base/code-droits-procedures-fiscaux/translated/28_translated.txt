A claim for a refund of excess value-added tax in cases where the 120-day period stipulated in the first paragraph of Article 32 of this Code applies results in the suspension of the right of deduction for the amounts claimed from the amounts due. (This paragraph was added by Article 32 of Law No. 71 of 2009, dated December 21, 2009, relating to the Finance Law for 2010).  If the tax authorities do not respond to the refund claim within the deadlines stipulated in the first paragraph of Article 32 of this Code, the claimant may recover their right of deduction.

The excess payment approved by the tax authorities is refunded to the claimant, regardless of the procedures followed for amounts that have not been approved by the aforementioned authorities.
