Any person who fails to pay the fees levied on road vehicles shall be penalized with a fine equal to 200% of the amount due.  Failure to affix the sticker proving payment of the circulation fee to the front windscreen of the vehicle, or failure to display the validated portion thereof, shall be punishable by a fine of 20 Dinars.  The documents of the vehicle committing the offence may be seized to guarantee payment of the fees and fines due. The seizure shall be lifted upon payment of the amounts due, or upon securing them with a public accountant, or by providing a bank guarantee.
