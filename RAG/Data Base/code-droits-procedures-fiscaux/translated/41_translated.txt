The tax authorities may request guidance, clarifications, or justifications relating to the review process.  In the case of a written request, the taxpayer is required to respond in writing within a maximum period of 20 days from the date of notification.  Notification is deemed to have occurred upon the taxpayer's or their agent's signature, in the presence of the competent official, on a notification slip or on the summons to appear at the appointed time, or upon delivery of the tax authorities' request. The delay in responding to the requests of the tax authorities shall not be taken into account in calculating the duration of the in-depth review of the tax situation. (This section was amended by Section 31 of Law No. 59 of 2014 dated December 26, 2014, relating to the Finance Act of 2015).
