The lawsuit [1] is a request by one party to another for the enforcement of a right in the presence of a judge; the requester is called the plaintiff, and the requested party is called the defendant. [2] The lawsuit is the right of anyone with a claim to bring it before the court for a ruling on its subject matter.  It is, for the opposing party, the right to present arguments or defenses aimed at refuting that claim.

Against the interests of the tax authorities, the lawsuit is filed before the  First Instance Court, which has jurisdiction over the tax authority in whose district the tax assets are located.

Tax assets are the funds collected by the state in the form of payments, and a payment is a cash amount paid by individuals and companies proportionately to their income or profits.

The party responsible for the file must act within a maximum period of sixty days from the date of service.

Service is deemed to have occurred upon the signature of the defendant, or their agent, in the presence of the competent official, on a service document or on the writ of summons for appearance at the appointed time.  The sixty-day period begins with the service of the mandatory employment decision, or from the date of expiry of the deadline set for responding to the recovery request. This is done through a written petition prepared by the claimant or their legally appointed representative, containing the information stipulated in the Code of Civil Procedure.

A copy thereof, accompanied by supporting documents, shall be served on the tax authorities.
