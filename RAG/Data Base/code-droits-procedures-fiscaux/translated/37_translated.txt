The initial review of permits, contracts, and documents filed with the tax authorities is based on the elements contained therein and all documents and information available to the administration, particularly those included in permits and documents filed by third parties under the applicable tax legislation, or those obtained by the tax authorities in the application of the provisions of Articles 16 and 18 of this Code.  The request for information under Article 16 mentioned above must be general and not target specific individuals. (This paragraph was added by Article 48 of Law No. 71 of 2009 dated December 21, 2009, relating to the Finance Act for 2010). Within the framework of initial tax audits, the tax authorities shall request in writing guidance, explanations, and justifications relating to the audit process. They may also, where necessary, request in writing from natural persons detailed statements of their income and elements of their standard of living. The taxpayer must respond in writing in both cases within a maximum period of twenty days from the date of notification of the request. Notification is considered to be the signature of the respondent, or their agent in the presence of the competent officer, on a notification form or on the summons to appear at the appointed time.

The tax authorities may not repeat the initial review for the same payment and the same period.

The tax authorities may extend this period by a maximum of one hundred and eighty days when requesting information from the competent authorities of countries linked to Tunisia by agreements relating to the exchange of information and administrative assistance in tax matters. The tax authorities must inform the taxpayer of the extension before the expiry of the ninety-day period.
