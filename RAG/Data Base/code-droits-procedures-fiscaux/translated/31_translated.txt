Reimbursement of overpaid amounts is possible only for the taxpayer who deposited their declarations covering all due payments whose due date fell on or before the date of the reimbursement request and the date of issuance of the authorization for the reimbursement of overpaid amounts.

These amounts are not subject to any form of appeal (this paragraph is completed by Article 63 of Law No. 54 of 2013, dated December 30, 2013, relating to the Finance Law for 2014). The tax authorities shall conduct the necessary verification to ascertain the validity of the reimbursement request; this verification shall not prevent a thorough review of the tax situation.

The assets collected by the State in the form of payments, where payment is a cash amount paid by individuals and companies proportionately to their income or profits, are as stipulated in Article 38 of this Code.
