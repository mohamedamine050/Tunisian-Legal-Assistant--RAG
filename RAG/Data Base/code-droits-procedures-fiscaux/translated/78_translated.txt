The tax authorities may conclude a settlement.

[1] A settlement is a contract concluded to resolve a dispute and terminate the litigation, either by each party relinquishing some of their claims or by the payment of money or a right.  [2] A settlement is a contract by which the parties terminate an existing dispute or prevent a potential one, each reciprocally relinquishing their right.

Concerning tax offenses, the assets collected by the state in the form of payments, wherein a payment is a cash amount paid by individuals and companies proportionally to their income or profits.

The criminal offenses are reviewed upon their detection or investigation before a judgment is issued concerning them.
