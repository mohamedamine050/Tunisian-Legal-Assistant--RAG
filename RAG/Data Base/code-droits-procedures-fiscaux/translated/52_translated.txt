The mandatory levy decision shall be enforced regardless of any objections lodged against it. Enforcement of the decision is suspended upon payment of 10% of the principal amount due or the provision of a bank guarantee for 15% of the same amount, within sixty days from the date of notification.  The suspension of enforcement applies until notification of the initial court judgment. Notification shall be deemed to have occurred upon the signature of the defendant or their agent in the presence of the competent officer, on a notification document or on the summons to appear at the appointed time.  The bank guarantee shall be available for recovery by the lending institution having the status of a bank one year from the date of notification of the levy decision. However, if the initial judgment is issued and notified before the expiry of the aforementioned period, recovery shall be limited to the amount awarded in the initial judgment. Upon expiry of the period referred to in the preceding paragraph, the lending institution may not object to the recovery or refer the recovery services to pursue the assets of those claiming payment. (The provisions of the first and second paragraphs have been repealed and replaced by Article 61 of Law No. 53 of 2015 dated December 25, 2015, relating to the Finance Act for 2016). Contrary to the provisions of the first paragraph of this article, the enforcement of mandatory levy decisions issued pursuant to the provisions of the second paragraph of Article 47 of this Code is suspended upon payment of 20% of the principal amount due. (This paragraph was added by Article 32 of Law No. 78 of 2019 dated December 23, 2019, relating to the Finance Act for 2020).

Exempted from the suspension of enforcement are the principal amount due and the administrative penalties incurred in the matter of deduction of payment from the supplier and the administrative penalties stipulated in Articles 83, 83 bis, and from 84 bis to 85 of this Code. (This paragraph was added by Article 43 of Law No. 54 of 2013 dated December 30, 2013, relating to the Finance Act for 2014, then amended by Article 61 of Law No. 53 of 2015 dated December 25, 2015, relating to the Finance Act for 2016, and by Article 51 of Decree No. 21 of 2021 dated December 28, 2021, relating to the Finance Act for 2022).

Cases related to objections to mandatory levy decisions whose enforcement has been suspended shall be decided within a maximum period of six months from the date of filing the claim before the court of first instance. (This paragraph was added by Article 3 of Law No. 1 of 2002 dated January 8, 2002, relating to the facilitation of tax procedures).
