The Director General of Taxation, the Head of the National Control and Tax Research Unit, the Director of the Large Institutions Department, the Director of the Medium-Sized Institutions Department, or the Head of the Regional Center for Tax Control shall initiate the action.  The action [1] is a request by one party for their rights from another in the presence of a judge; the requestor is called the plaintiff and the respondent is called the defendant. [2]  The action is the right of every claimant to bring their claim before the court for a judgment on the matter.  It is, for the defendant, the right to present grounds for defense or arguments aimed at refuting that claim.  Public actions, accompanied by duly completed reports, shall be brought before the Court of First Instance within whose jurisdiction lies the tax office that observed or handled the infraction, concerning tax-related offenses. Tax revenues are the funds collected by the State in the form of taxes, and a tax is a monetary sum paid by individuals and companies in proportion to their income or profits.


For non-physical penalty tax offenses, the action shall be brought before the Court of First Instance within whose jurisdiction lies the tax office that observed or handled the infraction. (This paragraph was amended by Article 75 of Law No. 78 of 2016 dated December 17, 2016, concerning the Finance Law for 2017, and by Article 66 of Law No. 66 of 2017 dated December 18, 2017, concerning the Finance Law for 2018). Tax revenues are the funds collected by the State in the form of taxes, and a tax is a monetary sum paid by individuals and companies in proportion to their income or profits.


For tax offenses involving physical penalties, the action shall be initiated by the Minister of Finance or the Director General of Taxation, upon delegation by the Minister of Finance, after obtaining the opinion of a committee.  The composition, tasks, and operating methods of the committee are determined by order. (This article was amended by Article 42 of Law No. 54 of 2013 dated December 30, 2013, concerning the Finance Law for 2014, and by Article 36 of Law No. 66 of 2017 dated December 18, 2017, concerning the Finance Law for 2018). Tax revenues are the funds collected by the State in the form of taxes, and a tax is a monetary sum paid by individuals and companies in proportion to their income or profits.


The Minister responsible for finance, the Director General of Taxation, the Head of the National Control and Tax Research Unit, the Director of the Large Institutions Department, the Director of the Medium-Sized Institutions Department, or the Heads of the Regional Centers for Tax Control, each within their respective jurisdictions, may appeal the judgments rendered concerning tax-related offenses to the Court of Appeal and the Court of Cassation. Tax revenues are the funds collected by the State in the form of taxes, and a tax is a monetary sum paid by individuals and companies in proportion to their income or profits.


They may also appoint a representative for this purpose in accordance with the applicable regulations. (This paragraph was added by Article 36 of Law No. 66 of 2017 dated December 18, 2017, concerning the Finance Law for 2018, and amended by Article 66 of Law No. 66 of 2017 dated December 18, 2017, concerning the Finance Law for 2018).  A statement of grounds for appeal to the Court of Cassation shall be submitted to the Court of Cassation registry. A court is a place where litigation takes place between parties and is a civil institution under the judicial authority that must have its independence within the three branches of government.  The appeal to the Court of Cassation, being the highest court in the judicial hierarchy, is justified by the principle of annulment to oversee the proper application of laws by the courts of first instance. This must be done within a maximum period of thirty days from the date of receipt of a copy of the appealed judgment from the registry of the court that issued it, specifying the grounds for appeal against the aforementioned judgment, through the tax office staff without special authorization. (This paragraph was added by Article 36 of Law No. 66 of 2017 dated December 18, 2017, concerning the Finance Law for 2018).
