Any person who, as a sailor, brings goods onto a ship without the knowledge of the captain, with the intent of transporting them, and these goods are not registered on the manifest, shall be punished by a fine of one thousand dinars and imprisonment for six months, or by one of these punishments. This penalty applies in addition to the punishment for the captain's act of unlawfully discarding cargo at sea when it poses a danger to the ship or cargo, and in addition to the punishment for the shipper's demand for higher than usual freight rates for the same journey and type of goods, based on the prevailing rates at the place and time of shipment.
