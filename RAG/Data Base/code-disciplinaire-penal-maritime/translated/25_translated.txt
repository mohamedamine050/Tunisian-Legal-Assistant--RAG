The aggrieved party has the right to pursue a personal claim before the competent court for any felony or misdemeanor committed on board a vessel. However, the aggrieved party cannot directly summon the suspect before the competent court. Instead, they must file a lawsuit with the investigating judge.

The competent court is the court before which the criminal lawsuit was filed. 

**Note:** 

* The terms "felony" and "misdemeanor" have been used to translate "جناية" and "جنحة" respectively. These terms are common in English legal terminology and accurately convey the legal concepts.
* "Investigating judge" is the most accurate translation for "حاكم التحقيق."
* The definitions provided for "دعوى" were omitted as they were redundant and would be disruptive to the flow of the text.
