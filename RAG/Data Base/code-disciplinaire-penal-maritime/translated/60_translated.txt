Any master who leaves ashore in a port where there is no Tunisian authority, an officer, a head, or a crew member who is sick or injured, without providing him with the means to obtain treatment or return to his homeland, shall be punished with a fine of three hundred dinars and imprisonment for three months or one of these two penalties.

The same penalty shall be imposed on any master who leaves ashore before reaching the intended destination, leaving a sick or injured passenger behind, without notifying the consular authority of the passenger's country of origin, or, in the absence of such authority, the local authorities.
