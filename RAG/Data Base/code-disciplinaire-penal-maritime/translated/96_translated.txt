Any outfitter or owner of a ship who fails to comply with the provisions of the Maritime Labor Code relating specifically to working conditions, workwear, food, and accommodation on board ships shall be punished with a fine of three hundred dinars for each offense found to have occurred.

The same penalty, in addition to the disciplinary measures provided for in Article 14 of this Code, shall be imposed on any captain who commits the offenses stipulated in the preceding paragraph, either personally or with the consent of the ship's outfitter. However, the penalty imposed on the captain may be reduced to one-quarter of the penalty imposed on the ship's outfitter if it is established that the captain received a written or oral order from the outfitter.

The penalties stipulated in the preceding two paragraphs shall be doubled in the event of a recurrence within the same year.
