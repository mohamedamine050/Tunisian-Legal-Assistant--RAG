The same penalty referred to in Article 39 of this Code shall be imposed on any ship's master who takes money with intent to defraud and without justification at the expense of the ship's hull, supplies, or equipment, or who mortgages, sells, or includes in his account alleged expenses, or who sells the ship he is commanding, except in the case of a legal survey confirming its unseaworthiness.

Such master shall be liable to the outfitter and personally obligated to return the money or to make good the value of the items, regardless of the criminal prosecution.
