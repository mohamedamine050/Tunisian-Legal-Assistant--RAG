The disciplinary log is a numbered and authenticated book by the maritime authority, which records the types of disciplinary offenses or circumstances of crimes or misdemeanors committed on board the vessel, as well as the results of investigations conducted pursuant to the provisions of this Code or its implementing provisions, as well as the penalties imposed and measures taken by the competent maritime authority in accordance with Articles 3 and 7 of this Code.

This log is kept on board the vessel, except for vessels intended for coastal navigation. For these vessels, the port authority where the vessel is moored maintains a joint log, which includes the entries prescribed in the preceding paragraph, in accordance with declarations made within two days following the vessel's arrival at the port.
