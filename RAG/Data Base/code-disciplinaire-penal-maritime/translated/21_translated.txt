The maritime authority may request any master of a Tunisian vessel bound for a Tunisian port to accept on board his vessel, if it allows, the premises of the vessel, any suspect in connection with a felony or misdemeanor, accompanied by a sealed file, and to allow him to board and be provided with food and drink throughout his journey. The master must, upon the vessel's arrival at a Tunisian port, place the suspect, along with the procedural file, at the disposal of the maritime authority, which shall bring the action before the competent judicial authority. 

In the absence of a Tunisian vessel meeting the conditions mentioned in the preceding paragraph, the maritime authority, or the master if that is not possible, shall take all necessary measures to return the suspect to his home country as soon as possible. The state shall bear the costs incurred in transporting the suspect who is returned to his home country by any means other than the vessel to which he belongs, following the submission of documents proving this, and except for the bringing of an action against the suspect.
