The penalties provided for in Article 253 of the Maritime Trade Code apply to every master who does not provide assistance to the best of his ability, without exposing his vessel, crew, or passengers to serious danger, to any person found at sea in danger of perishing, even if he is an enemy.

The same penalties shall be imposed on every master who negligently fails to use all means at his disposal to rescue, following a collision, the other vessel, its crew, and passengers, to the best of his ability, even if such action exposes his own vessel and passengers to danger.

The same penalties shall be imposed on every master who, except in cases of force majeure, leaves the scene of the accident before ascertaining that further assistance to the sunken vessel is futile, and who does not make every effort to rescue the survivors. The penalty may be doubled if a person or persons perish as a result of failure to comply with the provisions of this paragraph.
