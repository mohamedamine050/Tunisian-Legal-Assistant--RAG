## English Translation:

Seafaring individuals who collectively engage in acts of violence on board a vessel, whether armed or not, or who rise up against the authority of the captain and, after an explicit warning from the captain, refuse to return to order, shall be punished with temporary hard labor:

* **Officers or heads of departments** shall be sentenced to twenty years;
* **Others** shall be sentenced to ten years.

However, seafaring individuals who do not hold a paid position on board the vessel shall be punished like officers or heads of departments if they incite the mutiny.

Resistance by the captain and those loyal to him shall be considered legitimate self-defense.
