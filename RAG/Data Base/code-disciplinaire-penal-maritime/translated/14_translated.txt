The Minister responsible for merchant shipping, upon the proposal of the Director of Merchant Shipping, may, in the event of a final judgment rendered by a court for a felony or misdemeanor, as defined in this Code, or for any violation, as defined in the Penal Procedure Code, relating to the provisions of Articles 6 to 11 of the Merchant Shipping Code, impose a disciplinary penalty on any captain, officer, head or crew member, irrespective of the punishment imposed by the courts of general jurisdiction.

The disciplinary penalty may be imposed under the same circumstances in cases of obvious non-compliance, lack of competence, or serious professional misconduct. 

The disciplinary penalties that the Minister may impose in this capacity are:

* Reprimand, warning, censure, temporary or permanent suspension of certain duties on board the ship, temporary or permanent, partial or total, withdrawal of certain rights and privileges related to the type of qualification or certificate held by the person concerned. 

The withdrawal may be permanent in case of a final judgment for a felony or misdemeanor, or in case of the total loss of the vessel as a result of a violation by the person concerned, or a recurrence of the crimes referred to in the first paragraph of this Article. In all other cases, the withdrawal must be temporary and shall not exceed three years.

Any captain, officer, head or crew member whose case is referred to the Minister responsible for merchant shipping for the application of one of the penalties listed in this Article shall be deprived of the exercise of the rights and obligations related to the type of certificate or qualification held until his case is examined. 

The Director of Merchant Shipping shall not propose to the Minister responsible for merchant shipping the application of the penalty provided for in the first and second paragraphs above unless the person concerned has been allowed to present his defense.

The procedures to be followed for the application of the provisions of this Article shall be determined by order taken upon the proposal of the Minister responsible for merchant shipping.
