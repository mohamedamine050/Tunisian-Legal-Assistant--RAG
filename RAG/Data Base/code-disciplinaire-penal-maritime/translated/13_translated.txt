**Felonies** are defined as crimes punishable by death or imprisonment exceeding five years. **Misdemeanors** are defined as crimes punishable by imprisonment exceeding fifteen days but not exceeding five years, or by a fine exceeding sixty dinars. **Infractions** are defined as crimes punishable by imprisonment not exceeding fifteen days or by a fine not exceeding sixty dinars. (Article 122 of the Code of Criminal Procedure)

The penalty, which is a punishment and a remedy imposed in the name of society on a person criminally responsible for a crime committed based on a judicial ruling, is erased if the offender is not penalized during the following six months. In the case of an infraction, the penalty decided by the court is executed.

The penalty is executed without being added to the second penalty.  In case of recidivism, any sailor who commits four minor infractions or two serious infractions during the same voyage is subject to sanctions recorded in the disciplinary logbook and in the register of penalties. A serious infraction is equivalent to two minor infractions.

The case of every officer, chief, or crew member subject to two disciplinary measures by the Director of the Merchant Marine must be examined for the purpose of proposing the possibility of his temporary or permanent removal from the registration book by the Minister in charge of the Merchant Marine.
