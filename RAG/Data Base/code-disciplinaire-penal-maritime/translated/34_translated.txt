If a contract of employment for a maritime worker is for a fixed or indefinite period, and the notice period has expired, the maritime worker must be discharged from the position they hold so that they may freely leave the vessel.

The master who fails to order such discharge shall be subject to the penalties stipulated in the first paragraph of Article 31 of this Code. The same applies regardless of the form of the contract of employment, even if the maritime authority authorizes disembarkation in a foreign port for a serious reason.
