Any Tunisian who commits offenses abroad as prescribed by Articles 63 and 76 of this Code may be pursued and tried in Tunisia if the crime is punishable by the law of the country where it was committed.

No prosecution may be initiated if it is established that the suspect has been definitively tried in that country and that, if punished, the punishment has been served, has lapsed due to the passage of time, or has been pardoned.
