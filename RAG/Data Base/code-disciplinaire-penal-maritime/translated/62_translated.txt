Any ship master or pilot who sails or disembarks to land, as an officer, captain, or crew member, without allowing the maritime authority to register such sailing or disembarkation in the ship's log, shall be punished with a fine of one thousand dinars if the ship's existing cargo equals or exceeds twenty-five tons in volume, and with a fine of twenty-five dinars if the ship's existing cargo is less than that. This applies to each person whose sailing or disembarkation to sea occurred in an illegal manner.
