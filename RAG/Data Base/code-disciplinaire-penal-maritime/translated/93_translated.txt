**English Translation:**

Any captain or officer who destroys a ship by violence or fraud shall be punished by death. Any crew member who participates in this felony shall be punished by hard labor for life.

However, the death penalty shall be applied to all crew members if the act in this latter form is preceded, accompanied, or followed by death or injury.
