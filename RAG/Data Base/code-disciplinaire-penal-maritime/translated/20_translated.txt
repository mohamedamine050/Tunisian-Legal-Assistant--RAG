The captain shall submit the investigation file and its documents to the maritime authority at the first port where the vessel docks.

If the first port of docking is Tunisian, the maritime authority shall complete and, if necessary, attend to the completion of the captain's investigation and shall bring the action before the competent judicial authority.

If the first port of docking is not Tunisian, the maritime authority, or if this is not possible, shall decide on the fate of the suspect, taking into account all circumstances, especially the voyage of the vessel, and may in particular place the suspect in custody.
