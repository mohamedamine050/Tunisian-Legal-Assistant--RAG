Every master, upon the occurrence of any loss of the vessel, collision, or grounding, and generally, upon any maritime incident, must immediately submit a report detailing all the facts of the incident to the first representative of the maritime authority that they contact. The latter must immediately file a complaint [1] with the relevant regional authority of the maritime authority, who shall conduct an investigation and, if necessary, refer the case to the competent judicial authority.

[1] A legal action initiated by a party seeking relief from another party before a court of law; the party initiating the action is called the plaintiff, while the party against whom the action is brought is called the defendant. 

Outside of Tunisia, the maritime authority shall transmit the file to the Minister responsible for Maritime Trade, who shall file [1] a complaint with the judicial authority upon completion of the investigation, if required.

In the event of the loss of the vessel or its complete unseaworthiness, and if the investigation reveals serious charges against the master, the Director of Maritime Trade, upon the proposal of the regional representative, may temporarily revoke the master's right to command. Any interested party may appeal this decision to the Minister responsible for Maritime Trade.
