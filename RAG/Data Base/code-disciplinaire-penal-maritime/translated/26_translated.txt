The competent maritime authority, upon confirmation and in relation to the acts stipulated in the first paragraph of Article 57 and Articles 78 to 81 and 84 of this Code, attributed to a person or multiple persons belonging to the crew of a foreign vessel, may seize the vessel until a financial sum, determined by the maritime authority and designated to ensure the enforcement of judgments, is paid into the public treasury, regardless of public law procedures.

In the event of a final penalty that has not been executed, the amount paid to the treasury shall remain, after deduction of expenses and compensation for damages.

To ensure the enforcement of judicial decisions, the maritime authority may intercept the vessel's departure and order the taking of physical measures to prevent its departure.
