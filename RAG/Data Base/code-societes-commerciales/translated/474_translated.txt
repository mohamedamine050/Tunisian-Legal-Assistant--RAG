Without prejudice to any conflicting provisions, financial transactions may be carried out between companies belonging to a group of companies that are directly or indirectly linked by capital ties, where one company has influence over the other companies resulting from a shareholding of more than half the capital of the company concerned.  A financial transaction means any loan within the meaning of the legislation governing credit institutions, an advance on a current account, or a guarantee, whatever its nature and duration. These transactions may only be carried out under the following conditions:

1) The financial transaction must be ordinary and not result in difficulties for the party that carried it out;

2) The transaction must be justified by the actual need of the company concerned and must not be the result of tax considerations;

3) The transaction must have an actual or expected consideration for the company that carried it out;

4) The transaction must not aim to achieve personal objectives for the legal or de facto managers of the company concerned.
