A minority of partners in a company belonging to a group of companies, if their contributions are not less than ten percent of its capital, may initiate legal proceedings against the partners representing the majority in the parent company, in the event that decisions are made which harm the company's interests and aim to serve the interests of the majority at the expense of the legitimate rights of the minority.  Legal proceedings are initiated by a plaintiff before a court against another party, which may be an individual or a private entity, wherein the plaintiff claims a right or compensation for a loss caused by the company.
