The Chairman of the Board of Directors proposes the Board's agenda, convenes its meetings, presides over its sessions, and ensures the implementation of the choices determined by the Board of Directors.  In case of impediment, the Chairman of the Board of Directors may delegate the assignment of authority or responsibility to another person for the execution of specific activities. This delegation may be assigned to a member of the Board of Directors and is for a limited, renewable period. If the Chairman is unable to make this delegation, the Board of Directors may do so automatically. In this case, the Chairman of the Board of Directors is not considered a trader, contrary to the provisions of Article 213 of this Code. In the event of a judgment declaring the company bankrupt, he is prohibited from managing companies for five years from the date of the bankruptcy judgment if it is proven that he directly intervened in the management of the company. (Amended by Law No. 36 of 2016 dated April 29, 2016)
