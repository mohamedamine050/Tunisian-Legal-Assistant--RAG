A group of companies is a group of companies, each with its own legal personality, linked by common interests.

One of them, called the parent company, holds the remaining companies under its legal or actual influence and exercises control over them in a way that leads to unity of decision-making.  A company is considered to be under the influence of another company within the meaning of this heading if:

- Another company holds a percentage of its capital that grants it a majority of voting rights;

- Or another company holds a majority of the voting rights alone or by agreement with other partners;

- Or another company effectively controls decision-making within its general meetings by virtue of the voting rights it actually holds. Influence is presumed when a company directly or indirectly holds at least forty percent of the voting rights in another company, provided that no other partner holds a larger percentage. The parent company must be a shareholder, directly or indirectly, in the capital of each company belonging to the group of companies. A subsidiary is considered to be any company in which more than fifty percent of its capital is held directly or indirectly by the parent company, without regard to shares that do not grant their holder voting rights. The group of companies does not have legal personality.
