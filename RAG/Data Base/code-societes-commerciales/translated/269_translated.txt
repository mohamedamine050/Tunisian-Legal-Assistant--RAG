(Paragraph 2 amended by Law No. 65 of 2005 dated July 27, 2005)

Auditors must submit their report within one month from the date of notification of the company's financial statements.  If the members of the board of directors or the members of the collective management body deem it necessary to amend the company's financial statements based on the auditors' observations, then the auditors must revise their report in light of those observations. In the event of multiple auditors and a difference of opinion, a joint report must be prepared including the viewpoint of each auditor.  The phrase was replaced by Chapter III of Law No. 65 of 2005 dated July 27, 2005. The auditors' report must include their explicit opinion stating that they conducted the audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, and explicitly stating the approval of the accounts, a qualified approval, or a refusal to approve. Any auditor's report that does not contain an explicit opinion, or where the qualifications included are not clear and complete, shall be considered null and void.
