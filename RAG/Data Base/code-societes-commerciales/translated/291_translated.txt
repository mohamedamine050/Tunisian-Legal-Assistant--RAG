The extraordinary general meeting alone is competent to amend the constitutive act in all its provisions; any provision contrary thereto shall be considered null and void. The deliberations of the extraordinary general meeting shall not be considered legal unless the shareholders present or represented who have the right to vote hold, at the time of the first convening, at least half of the company's share capital, and one-third at the time of the second convening.  In the event that the latter quorum is not met, the deadline for convening the general meeting may be extended for a subsequent period not exceeding two months from the date of the convening. Decisions are adopted by a two-thirds majority of the votes of the shareholders present or represented who have the right to vote. The constitutive act may be amended by the Chairman and Managing Director. The Board of Directors in companies and institutions elects from among its members a chairman with the status of Chairman and Managing Director, or Managing Director, or Chairman of the collective management body, or sole Managing Director, if this is done in application of legal or regulatory provisions requiring it. The amended constitutive act shall be submitted for ratification to the first subsequent general meeting. (The fourth paragraph was added by Law No. 16 of 2009 dated March 16, 2009)
