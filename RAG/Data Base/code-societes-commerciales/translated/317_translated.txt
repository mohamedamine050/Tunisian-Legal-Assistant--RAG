Shares may grant their holders different rights, and shares granting similar rights constitute a single class of shares.  Each share confers a voting right in accordance with the provisions of this Code. These shares may be created either at the time of incorporation or upon an increase in the company's capital, as well as by the conversion of ordinary shares previously issued into this class of shares. The par value of these shares shall be equal to that of ordinary shares.
