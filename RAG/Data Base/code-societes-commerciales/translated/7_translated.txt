A company is considered commercial either by its form or by the subject matter of its activity.  Companies with shares, limited liability companies, and companies with undisclosed names are considered commercial in form, regardless of their subject matter.  Every commercial company, whatever its subject matter, is subject to commercial laws and their customary principles.
