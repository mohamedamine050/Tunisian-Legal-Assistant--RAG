In the event of a capital increase in cash, new investment certificates and voting rights certificates shall be issued in a number that allows maintaining the same proportion of ordinary shares and voting rights certificates before the increase, considering that the capital increase will be completed entirely.  Owners of investment certificates, within the limits of the percentage of bonds they own, shall enjoy the right of pre-emption in the new certificates and may waive this right during a special meeting convened and held in accordance with the rules of the extraordinary general meeting. The board of directors or the collective management body shall distribute the unsubscribed investment certificates, and the completion of the capital increase shall be assessed based on the subscribed shares. The updated voting rights certificates are granted with the new investment certificates to the owners of the old voting rights certificates within the limits of their rights, except in the case of their waiver in favor of all owners or some of them.
