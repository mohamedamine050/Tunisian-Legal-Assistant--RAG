An economic interest grouping is legally dissolved:

1) Upon expiry of the term. 2) Upon achievement or expiry of its purpose. 3) Upon the death of a natural person member or the dissolution of a legal person member of the grouping, unless the constituent contract of the grouping provides otherwise, or unless the remaining members unanimously decide to continue the grouping's activity.  The grouping is also dissolved:

1) By a decision issued by all members. 2) By a court order. 3) By a member losing legal capacity, or being declared bankrupt, or by a written court order prohibiting them from managing, disposing of, or supervising a company, unless the constituent contract provides otherwise or the remaining members decide to continue the grouping without them.
