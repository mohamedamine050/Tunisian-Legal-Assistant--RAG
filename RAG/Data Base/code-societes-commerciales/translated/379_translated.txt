The share certificate must be nominative.  Ownership can only be transferred in cases of inheritance or gift. A gift is a contract by which one person acquires the property of another without compensation.  Alternatively, transfer may occur in the case of company merger or division, or when attached to an investment certificate; in the latter case, the share's composition is fully reinstated.  A person's sworn testimony is often used as evidence in court.
