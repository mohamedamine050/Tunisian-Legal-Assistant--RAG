Regardless of the responsibility of the party concerned to respond to acts before the law or compensate for the damage caused, the agreements stipulated in Article 200 of this Code, concluded without prior authorization from the Supervisory Board if they have detrimental effects on the company, may be annulled. (The first paragraph was amended by Law No. 16 of 2009 dated March 16, 2009).

The action for annulment lapses three years from the date of the agreement.  If the agreement was concealed, the commencement of the limitation period is postponed to the day on which the agreement was discovered. Annulment can be avoided by a vote of the general meeting based on a special report prepared by the auditor(s) setting out the reasons that prevented the authorization procedures from being followed. In this case, the party concerned may not participate in the vote, and their shares are not taken into account when calculating the legal quorum and majority.
