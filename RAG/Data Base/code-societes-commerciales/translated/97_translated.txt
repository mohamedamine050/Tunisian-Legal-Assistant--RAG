(Paragraph three amended by Law No. 69 of 2007, dated December 27, 2007)

The establishment of a limited liability company shall not be finalized unless all shares are distributed among the partners in the founding contract.  The founding contract is a legally binding agreement that obligates the contracting parties and defines their obligations and rights with respect to the specific transaction.  The full value of the shares must be paid, whether the contributions of the partners are in kind or in cash, without exception. The founders must explicitly indicate in the founding contract the fulfillment of these conditions.  A contribution to the company may be work, the value of which shall be assessed and the share of profits it entitles to shall be determined by agreement between the partners within the founding contract. This contribution shall not be included in the company's capital structure.
