The agent has full authority to act in all cases on behalf of the company.  The company is bound, in its relations with third parties, even by the agent's actions that do not fall within the subject matter of the company, unless it proves that the third party was aware that the action exceeded its subject matter or that the third party could not have been unaware of it given the circumstances.  The mere publication of the constitutive contract is insufficient to constitute evidence. The conditions contained in the constitutive contract that define the agent's powers and result from this section cannot be opposed by third parties.
