The proceedings of judicial settlement or bankruptcy may be withdrawn against one of the companies belonging to a group of companies if the remaining companies belonging to the same group are implicated in a commingling of their financial assets or in fraud or the abusive exploitation of the company's funds.  Bankruptcy is a legal status in which a person or company is unable to pay its debts. This may lead to the liquidation of assets to pay creditors.  Alternatively, if it is proven that the debtor company was fictitious and that the companies belonging to the group of companies appeared as partners therein, the bankruptcy proceedings may be withdrawn. The legal or actual managers of the remaining companies belonging to the group of companies may be judged liable for the withdrawal of bankruptcy proceedings if it is proven that they caused the bankruptcy of the company.
