The death of a limited partner contributing capital does not lead to the dissolution of the limited partnership. If the continuation of the partnership with the heirs of the deceased partner is stipulated, then these heirs become limited partners contributing capital, even if they are minors and not emancipated.  If the deceased partner was the sole partner contributing work, and all his heirs are minors and not emancipated, he must be replaced by a new partner contributing work, or the partnership must be changed within six months from the date of death. Otherwise, the partnership is legally dissolved at the expiration of that period. If the constitutive contract stipulates the continuation of the partnership in the event of the death of the sole partner contributing work, or his loss of capacity, or his inability to perform his duties, then the summary judge of the court of first instance where the partnership is located may, at the request of any interested party, appoint a temporary manager to handle urgent matters and the management for the period necessary to change the partnership or appoint a new partner contributing work, without exceeding three months, renewable once. Any interested party may appeal the judgment, and the appointed person and the applicant for the appointment shall be summoned to appear before the judge who rendered the judgment.
