The General Assembly, upon a proposal from the Supervisory Board, may dismiss a member of the collective management body. If the dismissal decision is taken without a legitimate reason, it may lead to a claim for damages.  If a member of the collective management body has entered into a contract with the company, their dismissal from the body does not result in the termination of the contract.  A contract is a legally binding agreement that obligates the contracting parties and defines their obligations and rights concerning the specific transaction.
