A joint-stock company cannot hold shares in another joint-stock company representing more than ten percent of its capital.  Any violation thereof shall be classified as follows: felonies, within the meaning of this law, are crimes punishable by death or imprisonment exceeding five years; misdemeanors are crimes punishable by imprisonment exceeding fifteen days but not exceeding five years, or by a fine exceeding sixty dinars; and infractions are crimes punishable by imprisonment not exceeding fifteen days or a fine not exceeding sixty dinars.  Pursuant to the provisions of the first paragraph of this chapter, the acquiring company must inform the other company within fifteen days of the acquisition. If no agreement is reached between the two companies to resolve the situation, the company holding the smaller percentage of shares is obligated to divest itself of the shares acquired within one year of the acquisition. If the reciprocal shareholdings are of equal importance, each company must reduce its shareholding in the other to a level not exceeding ten percent. The company obligated to divest itself of its shares is prohibited from exercising the voting rights attached thereto until the situation is resolved.
