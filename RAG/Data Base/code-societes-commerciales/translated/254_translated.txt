(Amended by Article 1 of Law No. 16 of 2009 dated March 16, 2009)

If the judicial settlement or bankruptcy reveals an asset shortfall, the court, at the request of the judicial administrator, the trustee in bankruptcy, or one of the creditors, may decide that the company's debts are borne wholly or partially by the chairman of the collective management body or its members, or the sole general manager, or any other de facto manager, jointly and severally or otherwise, up to the amount determined by the court.  The court may also prohibit the judgment debtor from directly managing companies or conducting business activities for a period specified in the judgment. The aforementioned persons shall not be exempted from liability unless they prove that they exercised in the management of the company the diligence and care of a prudent entrepreneur and a diligent agent.  The claim shall lapse after three years from the date of the judicial settlement judgment or the bankruptcy judgment.
