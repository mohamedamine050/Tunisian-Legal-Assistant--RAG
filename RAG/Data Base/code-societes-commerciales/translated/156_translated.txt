The company is dissolved upon the death of the sole partner, or upon his loss of legal capacity, or upon his bankruptcy. Any interested party may apply to the court to request the dissolution of the company and the appointment of a liquidator. The court shall consider the request under expedited procedures. However, if the deceased partner leaves a sole heir, the latter may continue the company in place of his predecessor. In the event of multiple heirs and their disagreement on assigning the company to one of them, they may continue its operation as a limited liability company, following the procedures stipulated in the subsequent Article 157 of this Code.
