Every member of the collective management body or the supervisory board must inform the supervisory board of any agreement to which the provisions of Article 200 of this Code apply, immediately upon becoming aware of it.  If the member is a member of the supervisory board, he cannot participate in the vote on the required authorization, and his vote shall not be counted towards the legal quorum for determining the majority.
