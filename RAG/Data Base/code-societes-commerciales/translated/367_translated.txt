Punishment shall be imprisonment from one to five years and a fine from five hundred to five thousand dinars, or one of the two penalties:

1.  Persons who pretend to be shareholders but do not own shares and participate in voting at general meetings.
2.  Persons who handed over shares to others for use through deception.
3.  Persons who obtained a promise of granting them special advantages or a guarantee of obtaining them in exchange for their vote at the general meeting to approve an opinion or their abstention from voting.
