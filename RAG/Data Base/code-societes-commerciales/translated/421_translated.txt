When the creditors accept the guarantees proposed to them by the President of the Commercial Court or the President of the competent Primary Court, their publication shall be made in the Official Gazette of the Tunisian Republic and in two daily newspapers, one of which shall be in Arabic.  If the debts are secured by a guarantee, the guarantor must explicitly state his intention to transfer or not transfer his guarantee to the benefit of the company to be created by the merger.  Furthermore, the lease agreement shall be directly transferred to the benefit of the company resulting from the merger, and employment contracts shall remain legally valid with respect to it.
