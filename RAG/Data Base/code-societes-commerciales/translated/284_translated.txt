Every shareholder holding at least five percent of the share capital of a private limited company, or three percent if it is a public limited company, or holding a share in the capital of not less than one million dinars, has the right at any time to obtain copies of the company's documents referred to in Article 201 of this Code, and the reports of the auditors relating to the last three financial years, as well as copies of the minutes and attendance records of meetings held during the last three financial years. Shareholders collectively holding that percentage of the share capital may obtain the aforementioned documents and grant a mandate to someone to exercise the aforementioned right on their behalf. If the company refuses to deliver some or all of the documents referred to in the preceding paragraph, the aforementioned shareholder may bring the matter before the Urgent Judge.  In the event of a dispute or legal conflict between two parties, the claimant may request the court hearing the case to schedule a hearing to receive the statements of both parties. The claimant may also put questions to the defendant or defendants. (The first paragraph was amended and a third paragraph added by Law No. 16 of 2009 dated March 16, 2009).
