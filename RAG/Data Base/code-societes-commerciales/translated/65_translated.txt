In addition to the common grounds for dissolution applicable to all types of companies provided for in this Code,  partnership companies are subject to the following grounds for dissolution:

1. If it becomes impossible for a partner to transfer his shares when the company is formed for an indefinite period, provided that the decision to transfer the shares does not harm the legitimate interests of the company, taking into account the circumstances under which the transfer decision was made.

2. If a partner loses his capacity or is declared bankrupt by a court order. However, the remaining partners may unanimously decide to continue the company among themselves, excluding the resigning, incapacitated, or bankrupt partner.  They must then undertake the legal publication procedures.  Unless the company's constitutive act provides otherwise, a partnership company continues among the living in the event of the death of one of the partners if the deceased leaves no heirs to whom his rights devolve. If, however, this is not the case, the company continues with his heirs, who acquire the status of a lender partner, and the company automatically transforms into a simple limited partnership and must be legally publicized.
