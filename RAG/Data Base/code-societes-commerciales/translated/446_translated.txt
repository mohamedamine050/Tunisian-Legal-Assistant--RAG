The members of the economic interest grouping shall be personally and jointly and severally liable for its debts, unless there is a contrary agreement with the contracting third party. Creditors may not pursue the recovery of debts against any member except after notification to the grouping. In the event of the withdrawal of a member of the grouping, his liability for prior debts shall not lapse until three years from the date of publication of his withdrawal. Any agreement on total or partial exemption shall be binding only between the members and shall not be opposable to third parties. A new member of the grouping may be exempted from prior debts upon joining, provided that the constitutive agreement so provides or that all members of the grouping approve such exemption. The decision granting exemption must be published in accordance with the provisions of Article 16 of this Code; otherwise, it shall not be opposable to third parties.
