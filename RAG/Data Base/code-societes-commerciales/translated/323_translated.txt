In the event that shares of a private joint-stock company are traded through intermediaries on the stock exchange, and contrary to the provisions of Article 320 of this Code, the company must exercise its right of approval within the time limit stipulated in the constitutive contract, which cannot exceed thirty business days on the stock exchange.  If the company does not approve the buyer, the board of directors or the collective management body must find a shareholder or a third party to purchase the shares; otherwise, the company shall purchase them, resulting in a reduction of its capital. All of this must be done within thirty business days on the financial market from the date of notification.

Notification is considered effected by the signature of the defendant, or their agent, in the presence of the competent official, on a notification document, or on the summons to appear at the appointed time.  Rejection constitutes notification. The price used shall be the same as the first traded price, payable to the buyer whose purchase was not approved. If the time limit stipulated in the second paragraph above expires without the purchase being made, the approval shall be deemed to have been granted.
