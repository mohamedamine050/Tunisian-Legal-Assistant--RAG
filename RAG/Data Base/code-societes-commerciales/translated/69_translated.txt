The simple partnership shall bear a collective name containing the names of the contributing partners, preceded or followed by the phrase "Simple Partnership".  The collective name shall not contain the names of the contributing partners by capital. If a contributing partner by capital allows his name to be included in the collective name, he shall be bound towards third parties in good faith under the same conditions as if he were a contributing partner by work.
