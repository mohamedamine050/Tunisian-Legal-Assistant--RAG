The company is divided by the distribution of its financial assets among several existing companies or by the formation of new companies.  The division may be partial or total. If total, it necessarily results in the dissolution of the divided company without liquidation.  The entire capital of the divided company must be disbursed.  Only limited liability companies,  partnerships limited by shares, and companies with undisclosed names are permitted to divide.
