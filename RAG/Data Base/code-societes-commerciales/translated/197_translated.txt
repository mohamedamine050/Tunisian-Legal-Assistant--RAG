The Board of Directors enjoys broad powers to act in all cases in the name of the company within the limits of its subject matter. However, the Board of Directors cannot interfere with the powers of the general meetings of shareholders allocated to them by law.  Third parties cannot oppose provisions in the articles of association that limit the powers of the Board of Directors. The company is bound in its relations with third parties by the acts of the Board of Directors that do not relate to the company's subject matter, unless it proves that this third party knew, or should have known, that this act exceeded its corporate purpose.
