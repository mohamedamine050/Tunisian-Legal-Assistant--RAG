Any privilege defined in Article 200 of this Code, granted by agreement to the Chairman, the General Manager, the Assistant General Manager, or a member or several members of the Board of Directors, at the company's expense, does not exempt them from liability. Regardless of the responsibility of the party concerned to answer for their actions before the law or compensate for the damage caused, the agreements referred to in Article 200 of this Code, which were concluded without prior authorization from the Board of Directors if they have detrimental effects on the company, may be annulled.  The action for annulment is extinguished by the passage of three years from the date of the agreement. If the agreement was concealed, the commencement of the limitation period is deferred to the day on which the agreement was discovered. Annulment may be avoided by a vote of the general meeting based on a special report prepared by the auditor(s) setting out the reasons that prevented the authorization procedure from being followed. In this case, the party concerned may not participate in the vote, and their shares are not counted in calculating the quorum and the majority.
