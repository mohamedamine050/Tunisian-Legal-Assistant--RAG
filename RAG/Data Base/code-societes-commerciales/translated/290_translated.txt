Shareholders holding at least ten percent of the company's capital may request the annulment of decisions that violate the constitutive contract or are detrimental to the company's interests and are taken for the benefit of some shareholders, one shareholder, or a third party.  The action for annulment lapses one year from the date of the decision, or if the reason for annulment ceases to exist before the action is filed.

The judgment is initially rendered at first instance. The court seized of the case, even of its own motion, may set a deadline to avoid annulment. Legal costs are borne by the defendant in the event of avoidance of annulment after the action is filed. The emergency judge may order the provision of a bank guarantee to secure potential damages to the company. (The first paragraph was amended by Law No. 69 of 2007 dated December 27, 2007)
