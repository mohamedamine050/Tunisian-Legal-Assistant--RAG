If all the shares in a general partnership or a limited liability company are held by a single partner, the company shall be transformed into a sole proprietorship with limited liability.  If this situation is not regularized within one year from the date all shares are held by a single party, any interested party may judicially demand the dissolution of the company. The competent court may grant an additional period not exceeding six months to regularize the situation. In all cases, the dissolution of the company cannot be declared if the situation is regularized before the originally assigned court initially rules on the matter.
