The negotiating company (Compagnie de n√©gociation) is a traditional type of company characterized by complete flexibility and transparency, and by the definition of the partners' liability.  They are jointly and severally liable amongst themselves, and each one is liable to third parties for the full extent of their financial assets without limitation, and for all the company's debts. Contributions to the negotiating company may be made in any form: cash, in-kind, or services.

It is composed of two or more persons who are personally and jointly and severally liable for the company's debts. The company conducts its business under a collective name consisting of the names of all partners, or one of them, or some of them, followed by the phrase "and their partners". Any person external to the company who knowingly consents to the inclusion of their name in the company's collective name guarantees its debts to anyone deceived by this designation.
