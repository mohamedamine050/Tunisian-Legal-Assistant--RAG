The silent partner is prohibited from interfering in the management of the company's affairs, even if such interference is pursuant to authorization.  If this prohibition is violated, the silent partner shall be jointly and severally liable, without limitation, with the working partners for all obligations arising from the prohibited acts. Their liability shall be proportionate to the number of acts of interference or their severity,  limited to the consequences resulting from their actions, or encompassing all the company's debts.  Monitoring the actions of agents, providing opinions and advice to them, as well as authorizing them to undertake actions exceeding their authority, are not considered acts of interference in the external management and disposition of the company.
