Preference shares, granting priority in profit exceeding the company's liabilities by including the company's capital among its debts at the end of the fiscal year, without voting rights, are considered financial instruments.  They are issued by resolution of an extraordinary general meeting during a capital increase or by conversion of existing ordinary shares. No company may issue preference shares granting priority in profit exceeding the company's liabilities by including the company's capital among its debts at the end of the fiscal year without voting rights unless it has realised profits during the last three years or has provided the holders of such shares with a bank guarantee ensuring them an income equal to the minimum profit stipulated in Article 350 of this Code.
