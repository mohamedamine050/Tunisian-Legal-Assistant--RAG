Every commercial company constitutes a separate legal entity distinct from the personality of each of its partners, commencing from the date of its registration in the commercial register, except for a partnership en commandite.  A change in the company's form or an extension of its term shall not result in the creation of a new legal entity. The company shall be named according to its social name or its corporate name.
