(Added by Law No. 16 of 2009 dated March 16, 2009)

In addition to the registers and documents provided for by the legislation in force, the company must keep:

- A register containing the name, title, and address of each manager or member of the supervisory board.
- A register of shares or securities containing, in particular, details relating to the securities it holds, the identity of their owners, the transactions carried out on them, and the rights and obligations attached to them, taking into account the provisions of Law No. 35 of 2000 dated March 21, 2000, relating to the establishment of dematerialized securities.  Partners are entitled to access the contents of these registers under the same conditions stipulated in Article 11 above during the company's normal working hours. However, for limited liability companies with public shareholding, shareholders may only inspect the securities register to the extent that it relates to their own participation.  Otherwise, inspection may be permitted by order of the President of the Primary Court in whose jurisdiction the company's registered office is located, provided the applicant has a legitimate interest. Furthermore, a list of shareholders in limited liability companies must be made available to shareholders at least fifteen days before each general meeting of shareholders.
