(Amended by Article 1 of Law No. 96 of 2005 dated October 18, 2005)  All commercial companies must appoint a qualified auditor.  The appointment must place a suitable individual in a position consistent with the requirements and qualifications for performing the role.  Commercial companies, except for joint-stock companies, are exempt from appointing a qualified auditor:

- During their first fiscal year of operation;

- Or if they do not meet two minimum thresholds concerning the total balance sheet amount and total revenue, excluding performance, and the average number of employees;

- Or if, during the last two fiscal years, they did not meet two minimum thresholds referred to in the second paragraph, regarding the appointment of an auditor. The auditor must be appointed from among the registered chartered accountants listed in the register of the Tunisian Chartered Accountants' Association if the company meets two minimum thresholds concerning the total balance sheet amount and total revenue, excluding performance, and the average number of employees. If these thresholds are not met, an auditor must be appointed from among either the chartered accountants registered in the register of the Tunisian Chartered Accountants' Association or specialists in accounting registered in the register of the Tunisian Accountants' Association. The minimum thresholds and the method of calculating the average number of employees, referred to in the second and third paragraphs of this article, shall be determined by order. The rules set out in Chapter III of Title III of Book IV of this Code shall apply to the auditor appointed under the provisions of this article.
