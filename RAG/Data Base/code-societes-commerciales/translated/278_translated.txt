The ordinary general meeting shall take all decisions except those relating to the subjects set forth in Articles 291 to 295, and Articles 298 and 300, and Articles 307 to 310 of this Code.  The deliberations of the first general meeting shall only be valid if the shareholders present in person or by proxy hold at least one-third of the shares conferring voting rights.

If this quorum is not met, a second general meeting shall be held, without any specific legal quorum being required.  A period of at least fifteen days must be observed between the first and second meetings. The general meeting shall decide by a majority of the votes of the shareholders present in person or by proxy. Each shareholder may vote by mail or through any person presenting a special power of attorney. In the case of voting by mail, the company must make a special form available to the shareholders for this purpose.  Such voting shall only be valid if the signature on the form is identified. Only votes received by the company before the day preceding the general meeting shall be counted. Voting by mail must be addressed to the company by registered mail with acknowledgment of receipt, or by any other means leaving a written trace or having the probative value of a written document.
