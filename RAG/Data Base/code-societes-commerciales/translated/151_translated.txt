In a sole proprietorship limited liability company, the auditor of in-kind contributions, as stipulated in Article 100 of this Journal, is appointed by the sole partner and is required to prepare a report. This report, a form of information transmission, is drafted in a nearly final form for delivery to the recipient. It is attached to the constitutive contract. The phrase was replaced by Article 3 of Law No. 65 of 2005 dated July 27, 2005.  If the appointment of the auditor of in-kind contributions does not take place, the sole partner shall be personally liable to third parties for the value granted to the in-kind contributions during the company's incorporation.  The claim for liability shall lapse after three years from the date of the company's incorporation.
