Each partner is indebted to the company for their contribution. The company may claim penalties for any delay in fulfilling their contribution. If their contribution is in kind, the partner is a guarantor for the benefit of the company under the same conditions applicable to the seller.  If the contribution is in usufruct, the partner is a guarantor for the benefit of the company under the same conditions applicable to the grantor.  [1] A guarantor is one who undertakes the obligation of another while the obligation remains on the other, or it is the addition of one's liability to the liability of another for what is owed presently or in the future. [2] This means a person who provides or issues a surety, a guarantee payable on demand, a letter of guarantee, or any other form of guarantee: this is for the purpose of securing the fulfillment of any obligation in favor of a creditor.
