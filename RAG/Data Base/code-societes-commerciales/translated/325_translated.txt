If a shareholder fails to pay the remaining amounts due on the shares subscribed for within the deadlines set by the Board of Directors or the collective management body, the company shall send him a notice by registered mail with acknowledgment of receipt or by any other means leaving a written trace or having the probative value of a written document. If one month elapses without any effect resulting from this notice, the company shall proceed with the sale of the aforementioned shares on the financial market without court authorization. The defaulting shareholder and his successors and subscribers shall be jointly and severally liable for the payment of the remaining value of the shares not paid. The company may pursue them before, after, or concurrently with the sale to recover the outstanding amount and expenses incurred. The party who has paid the company in full shall have recourse against the subscribers and subsequent shareholders for all amounts paid in the lawsuit. Any shareholder who transferred the shares he owns shall no longer be liable two years after the transfer of these shares on the stock exchange for any unpaid balance.
