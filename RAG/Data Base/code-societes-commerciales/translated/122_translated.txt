The agent appointed by the constitutive contract may be dismissed by a decision issued by the partners assembled in a general meeting representing at least three-quarters of the company's share capital. If his appointment was recorded in a separate instrument, he may be dismissed with the approval of the partners assembled in a general meeting representing more than half of the company's share capital. A partner or partners holding at least one-quarter of the company's share capital may bring an action before the competent court to obtain the dismissal of the agent for just cause.
