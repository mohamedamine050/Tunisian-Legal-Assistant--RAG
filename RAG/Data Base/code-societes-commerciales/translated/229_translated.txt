The collective management body enjoys broad powers to act in all cases in the name of the company.  It deliberates and makes its decisions according to the conditions stipulated in the constitutive contract. The collective management body exercises its powers within the scope of the company's object, except for the powers explicitly granted by law to the supervisory board or the general meetings. In its relations with third parties, the company is bound by the acts of the collective management body that fall within the company's object. However, provisions in the constitutive contract or decisions of the supervisory board that limit these powers cannot be challenged by third parties unless it is proven that the third party knew, or should have known, that this act exceeded the company's object. Third parties cannot challenge the limitations stipulated in the constitutive contracts on the powers of the collective management body.
