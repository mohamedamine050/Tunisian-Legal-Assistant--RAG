Merger is the union of two or more companies to form a single new company.  The merger results either from the absorption of one or more companies by other companies, or from the formation of a new company from those companies. The merger leads to the dissolution of the merged or absorbed companies and the complete transfer of their financial assets to the new company or to the absorbing company. The merger is carried out without the liquidation of the merged or absorbed companies, and if the merger results from absorption, it must be done by increasing the capital of the absorbing company in accordance with the provisions of this Code.
