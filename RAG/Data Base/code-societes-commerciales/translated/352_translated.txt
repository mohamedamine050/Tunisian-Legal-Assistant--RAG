If the preferential dividends are not paid in full for two consecutive years, the preferential shares shall retain their characteristics, granting their holders the right to attend general meetings and to vote, and the preferential shares shall not be excluded from the total number of shares comprising the capital when calculating the quorum in all other meetings.  The enjoyment of these rights continues until the due preferential dividends are paid in full.
