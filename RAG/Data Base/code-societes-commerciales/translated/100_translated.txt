The constitutive contract must include an appraisal of each in-kind contribution.  Each contribution must be appraised by the person appointed to appraise the in-kind contributions, who is appointed by unanimous vote of the future partners.  In the event of impossibility, this appointment may be made by order on petition issued by the President of the Court of First Instance within whose jurisdiction the company's registered office is located, at the request of the most diligent future partner.  The report of the person appointed to appraise the in-kind contributions must be attached to the constitutive contract. However, the partners may decide by majority vote not to resort to a person appointed to appraise the contributions if the value of each in-kind contribution does not exceed three thousand dinars. In the event of failure to appoint the person to appraise the contributions, the partners shall be jointly and severally liable to third parties regarding the value assigned to the in-kind contributions at the time of the company's incorporation.  The action in this regard shall lapse three years from the date of incorporation.
