(Article 2 of Law No. 65 of 2005 dated July 27, 2005, has been amended)

The liquidator's mandate is set for one year.  If the liquidation process is not completed before the expiry of this period, the liquidator must submit a report explaining the reasons for the non-completion of the liquidation proceedings and proposing new deadlines for its completion. The liquidator's mandate may be renewed twice for the same period, by decision of the general meeting of the partners, in accordance with the conditions stipulated in Article 30 of this Code, and, if this is impossible, by decision of the judge of urgent matters, upon request of any interested party.
