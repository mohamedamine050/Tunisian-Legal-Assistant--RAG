(Amended by the first section of Law No. 65 of 2005 dated July 27, 2005)

Subject to the provisions of Article 210 of this Code, and in the event of a vacancy on the Board of Directors due to death, incapacity, resignation, or loss of capacity, the Board of Directors may, between two general meetings, make temporary appointments.  The appointment made by the Board pursuant to the first paragraph of this Article is subject to ratification by the next ordinary general meeting. If ratification is not possible, the decisions taken and actions carried out by the Board shall remain valid. When the number of members of the Board of Directors falls below the legal minimum, the remaining members of the Board of Directors must immediately convene an ordinary general meeting to fill the vacancy. If the Board of Directors fails to make the required appointment or if the general meeting is not convened, any shareholder or the auditor may request the Urgent Court to appoint a representative charged with convening the general meeting for the purpose of making the permitted appointments or ratifying the appointment provided for in the first paragraph of this Article.
