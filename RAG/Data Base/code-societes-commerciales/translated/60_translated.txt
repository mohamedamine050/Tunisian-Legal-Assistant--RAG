The agent shall undertake all transactions in the interest of the company, unless the constitutive act specifies his/her duties. In the case of multiple agents, each of them individually enjoys all the powers stipulated in the preceding paragraph.

An objection by one agent to the acts of another agent has no effect against third parties unless their knowledge thereof is proven.  If the agent is a legal entity, its managers are subject to the same civil and criminal liabilities as if they were agents in their personal capacity, regardless of their joint and several liability with the legal entity they manage.
