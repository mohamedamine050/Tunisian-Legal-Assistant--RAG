(Amended by Law No. 16 of 2009 dated March 16, 2009)

If the judicial settlement or bankruptcy reveals a deficit in assets, the court, at the request of the judicial administrator, the trustee in bankruptcy, or one of the creditors, may decide that the company's debts are borne wholly or partly by the agent or agents or any de facto manager, jointly and severally or otherwise, up to the amount determined by the court.  The court may also seize the assets of the judgment debtor and prohibit them from directly managing companies or conducting business for a period determined by the judgment. The legal or de facto agent shall not be exempted from liability unless they prove that they exercised in the management of the company the diligence and care of a prudent entrepreneur and an honest agent. The claim is extinguished by the passage of three years from the date of the judicial settlement or the bankruptcy judgment.
