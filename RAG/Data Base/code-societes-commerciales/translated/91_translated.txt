The company shall bear a social name which may include the name of some or one of the partners.  The social name must be preceded or immediately followed by the phrase "S.A.R.L." along with the company's capital. If the company is a sole proprietorship, the phrase shall be "E.U.R.L.", and the amount of the company's capital must also be stated. The company may not adopt the same social name as a previous company or one similar to it, or a similar name that is likely to mislead third parties. In this case, anyone concerned may resort to the competent court to put an end to this similarity, while retaining their right to compensation for damages resulting therefrom.
