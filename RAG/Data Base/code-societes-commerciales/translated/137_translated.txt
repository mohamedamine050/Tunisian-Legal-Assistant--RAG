If the extraordinary general meeting decides to reduce the company's capital, creditors whose debt predates the deliberation may object within one month from the date of publication of the reduction decision.  The objecting creditor must, within the aforementioned period, bring an action before the summary judge who will examine the seriousness of the objection. If the judge decides that the claim is serious, he shall order either the payment of the debt or sufficient security for its payment. The capital reduction shall not be effective until the objection period has expired.
