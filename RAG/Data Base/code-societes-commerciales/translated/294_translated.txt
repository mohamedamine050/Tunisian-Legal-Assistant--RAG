The Extraordinary General Meeting may delegate to the Board of Directors or the collective management body the necessary powers for the purpose of increasing the capital, once or several times, specifying the methods of carrying out such increase, verifying its implementation, and amending the constitutive articles accordingly.  The increase in the company's capital must be implemented within a maximum period of five years from the date of the decision taken by the Extraordinary General Meeting or the authorization thereof. However, one quarter of the increase in the company's capital and the full issue premium, where applicable, must be paid within six months from the date of the opening of the subscription. (Paragraph three amended by Law No. 65 of 2005 dated July 27, 2005).  Should this prove impossible, the decision to increase the company's capital shall be null and void. Any clause in the constitutive articles authorizing the Board of Directors or the collective management body to decide on the increase of capital shall be considered null and void.
