The company may convene a special general meeting of the holders of preferred profit shares, without voting rights, to consider the inclusion of the company's capital within its liabilities at the end of the financial year.

In this case, the company shall determine the agenda of the said meeting. A group of holders of preferred profit shares, without voting rights, representing at least ten percent of this class of shares, may request the company to convene their special general meeting.  A request shall be submitted to the company specifying the agenda of the special general meeting. If the special general meeting is not convened within the month following the date of submission of this request, the group of holders of preferred profit shares, without voting rights, may itself convene the special general meeting after obtaining authorization from the President of the Court within whose jurisdiction the company's registered office is located.
