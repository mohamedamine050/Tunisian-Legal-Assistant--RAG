In the case of multiple agents, each shall individually have the powers stipulated in Article 398 of this Code.  An objection raised by one agent against the actions of another agent – a person acting on behalf of another – shall have no effect against third parties unless it is proven that the third party had knowledge of the agent's lack of authority to perform that act. Contrary to the provisions of Article 391 of this Code, the agent shall be subject to the same rules of liability and have the same obligations as managers of a general partnership.
