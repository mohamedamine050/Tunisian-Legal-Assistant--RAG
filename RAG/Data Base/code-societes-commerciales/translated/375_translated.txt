The extraordinary general meeting of a limited liability company may decide, based on a report from the board of directors or a report from the collective management body and the auditor's report, to split the shares into two different certificates: - an investment certificate representing the financial rights related to the share.  This certificate is preferential when it is granted priority in profits. - a voting certificate representing the remaining rights related to the share.
