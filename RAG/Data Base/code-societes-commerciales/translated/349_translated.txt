Priority shareholders are entitled to receive, in addition to what is due to the company, any surplus profit in the company's capital at the end of the fiscal year, without voting rights, enjoying the same rights granted to ordinary shareholders, except for the right to attend general meetings of shareholders and the right to vote, given that they are priority shareholders in profit.
