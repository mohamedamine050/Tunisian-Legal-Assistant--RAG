The liquidator shall distribute the available funds to the creditors according to their ranks. If creditors of the same rank have claims that the liquidation proceeds are insufficient to fully satisfy, they shall share proportionally according to their debts of the same rank.  The assignee of a preferred creditor's right shall succeed to all their rights. The liquidator shall also distribute the remaining funds from the liquidation to the partners after securing the rights of the company's creditors and securing the debt of any creditor whose debt is fixed and determined.  He must publish the distribution decision as a notice in the Official Gazette of the Tunisian Republic and in two daily newspapers, one of which is published in Arabic. Any interested party may object within ninety days from the date of the last announcement, by recourse to the judge of urgent matters, who shall examine the validity of the distribution. The distribution cannot be completed before the expiry of the objection period. The objection to the distribution is suspended until the final judgment is rendered. If the liquidation results from the dissolution of the company, the partners, after the settlement of all creditors, may recover movable or immovable property that was the subject of their contribution, unless the constitutive act provides otherwise.
