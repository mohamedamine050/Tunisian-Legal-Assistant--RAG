The board of directors or the collective management body may use the resources stipulated in Article 298 of this Code, or only some of them, according to the order it determines.  The increase in the company's capital shall not be realised unless, after exercising these resources, the amount of subscriptions received totals the increase in capital or three-quarters of this increase in the case stipulated in the preceding article. However, the board of directors or the collective management body may automatically, and in all cases, limit the increase in capital to the amount of subscriptions if the shares for which no subscription has been made represent less than five percent of the increase in capital. Any contrary decision by the board of directors or the collective management body shall be null and void.
