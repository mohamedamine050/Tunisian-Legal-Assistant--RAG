Five percent of profits shall be deducted annually to constitute reserves.  This deduction shall no longer be obligatory if the reserves reach ten percent of the capital. (Paragraph 3 amended by Law No. 65 of 2005 dated July 27, 2005)

Each partner shall be paid their share of the distributed profits within a maximum period of three months from the date of the general meeting that decided on the distribution. The partners may unanimously decide otherwise.  If the aforementioned three-month period is exceeded, the undistributed profits shall generate commercial surplus within the meaning of the legislation in force. (Added by Law No. 47 of 2019 dated May 29, 2019)

Profits, if any, shall be distributed after the constitution of the legal reserve and the optional reserve, at least once every three years, at a rate of not less than thirty percent thereof, unless the general meeting of partners unanimously decides otherwise. The company may demand that partners return the shares of profits they received which do not correspond to actually realized profits.  Any claim for recovery shall lapse three years from the date of receipt of the undue profit shares.
