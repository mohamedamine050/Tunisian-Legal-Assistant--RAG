The Board of Directors appoints the company’s General Manager for a fixed term. If the General Manager is a member of the Board, the duration of his duties shall not exceed the term of his mandate. The General Manager must be a natural person. The Board of Directors may terminate the General Manager’s duties.  The General Manager, under his responsibility, manages the company’s general affairs, taking into account the powers expressly granted by law to the general meetings of shareholders, the Board of Directors, and its Chairman. The General Manager attends the public meetings held by the competent bodies, according to the procedural rules set forth in this guide, with the aim of obtaining specific information concerning the works or activities carried out by the general management, to ensure the soundness, integrity, transparency, and compliance with the requirements of the public interest. The General Manager attends Board of Directors meetings without the right to vote unless he is a member of the Board. The Board of Directors may, at the request of the General Manager, appoint one or more Deputy General Managers to assist him. If the General Manager is prevented, he may delegate all or part of his functions to a Deputy General Manager, provided that this renewable delegation is always granted for a limited period. If the General Manager is unable to grant this delegation, the Board of Directors may grant it itself. In the absence of a Deputy General Manager, the Board of Directors shall appoint a suitable person for the position, whose qualifications and competencies are consistent with the requirements of the job. The person to whom the delegation is assigned shall be appointed. The General Manager is considered a trader within the application of the provisions of this code. In the event of a judgment declaring the company bankrupt, he shall be prohibited from managing companies for five years from the date of the bankruptcy judgment, if it is proven that he directly intervened in the management of the company.
