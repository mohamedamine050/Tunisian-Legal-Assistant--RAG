Insurance companies, banks, lending institutions, and other financial institutions, and generally any company that the law requires to adopt a specific form, cannot enter into a contract where the insurer undertakes to pay the insured or the beneficiary a sum of money, a periodic income, or any other financial compensation in the event of the occurrence of the insured event, in exchange for premiums or any other financial payment made by the insured to the insurer, unless it adopts the form of a limited liability company; otherwise, the contract is void.
