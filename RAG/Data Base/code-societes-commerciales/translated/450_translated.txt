The Association of Members of the Assembly is qualified to take any decision, including early dissolution or a decision to extend its term, in accordance with the conditions specified in the constitutive contract.  The constitutive contract may stipulate that all decisions, or some of them, are to be taken in accordance with the quorum and majority requirements it specifies.  In the absence of any provision in the contract, decisions are taken unanimously. If the matter concerns elections, whether direct or indirect, of one of the members, then his vote is not counted towards the required quorum. Each member of the assembly is allocated one vote, unless the constitutive contract stipulates that each member has a number of votes different from that granted to others.
