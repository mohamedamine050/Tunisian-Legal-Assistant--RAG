Shareholders, in the event of a capital increase, enjoy the preferential right to subscribe to investment certificates, in accordance with the procedures followed for capital increase operations.  The voting certificates resulting from the capital increase are distributed to shareholders in proportion to their rights, except in the case of their assignment to some shareholders or to one of them. The creation of investment certificates is subject to the rules referred to in Articles 172 and 173 of this Code, in the case of a capital increase by in-kind contribution.
