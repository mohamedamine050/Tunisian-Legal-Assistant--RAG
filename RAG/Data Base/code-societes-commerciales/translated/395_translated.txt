The ordinary general meeting, in accordance with the conditions specified in the constitutive contract, appoints the Supervisory Board.

It shall be composed of at least three shareholders.  Its appointment in any other manner is void, and a working lender-partner cannot be a member of the Supervisory Board. Shareholders who are working lenders cannot participate in the appointment of members of the Supervisory Board.

The appointment should place the appropriate individual in the position, commensurate with the qualifications and competencies required to perform it.

If the constitutive contract does not specify the method of selecting the members of the Supervisory Board (1) or the duration of their term, the members of that board shall be appointed by decision of the lender-partners holding at least fifty percent of the company's capital. The term of office is three years.
