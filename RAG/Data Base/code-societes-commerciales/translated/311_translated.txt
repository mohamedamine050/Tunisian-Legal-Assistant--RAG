Creditors whose debts arose before the date of the last publication of the capital reduction decision have the right to oppose this reduction until their debts, whose due date has not yet arrived at the time of publication, are secured.  Creditors whose debts were sufficiently secured are not entitled to this right.  The right of objection must be exercised within one month of the date of the last publication of the capital reduction decision. The capital reduction decision shall have no effect if the company has not provided the creditor with security or its equivalent, or has not notified the creditor of its receipt of sufficient collateral for its benefit from a specialized and legally qualified credit institution regarding the amount of debt the creditor possessed, so long as the claim for its enforcement has not been extinguished.
