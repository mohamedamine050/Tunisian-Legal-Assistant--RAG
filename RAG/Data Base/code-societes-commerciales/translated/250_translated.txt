Agreements, whether approved or rejected by the general meeting, produce effects against third parties unless they are annulled on grounds of fraud.  The relevant member of the supervisory board or the collective management body, and where necessary the remaining members of the collective management body, may bear the consequences of agreements rejected by the general meeting which caused damage to the company, even in the absence of fraud.
