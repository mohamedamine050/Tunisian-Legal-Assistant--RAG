If the partnership is disclosed to a third party in any manner whatsoever, then the partners shall be bound by the same conditions that bind partners in a general partnership.  The disclosure of a limited partnership to a third party does not result in the nullity of the contract, the legal termination of the contract due to defects or violations, which continues to govern the relationships between the partners, and any conflicting term in the constitutive contract cannot be opposed by a third party.
