When increasing capital by cash contribution, holders of preferred shares, which enjoy priority in profit exceeding the company's liabilities at the end of the financial year and without voting rights like ordinary shareholders, benefit from preferential subscription rights.  Holders of preferred shares, which enjoy priority in profit exceeding the company's liabilities at the end of the financial year and without voting rights, also benefit from free new shares issued during capital increases through the incorporation of reserves or profits, or by issuing shares. However, the extraordinary general meeting, after consulting the special general meeting, may decide to grant holders of preferred shares, which enjoy priority in profit exceeding the company's liabilities at the end of the financial year and without voting rights, preferential subscription rights or the acquisition of preferred shares, which enjoy priority in profit exceeding the company's liabilities at the end of the financial year and without voting rights, issued at the same rate as the capital increase.  Any increase in the nominal value of existing shares during a capital increase through the incorporation of reserves or profits shall apply to preferred shares, which enjoy priority in profit exceeding the company's liabilities at the end of the financial year and without voting rights. In this case, the priority in profit exceeding the company's liabilities at the end of the financial year is calculated from the date of completion of the capital increase based on the nominal value of the new shares.
