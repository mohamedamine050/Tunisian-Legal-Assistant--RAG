(Article 1, paragraph 1, of Law No. 65 of 2005 dated July 27, 2005, has been amended)

A simple partnership consists of two teams of partners: firstly, a team of partners contributing work, who may exclusively be entrusted with its management and bear unlimited joint and several liability for the company's debts, and for the obligation to respond to the actions of a person before the law or to compensate for the damage caused; and secondly, a team of partners contributing capital, who contribute capital and are only liable to the extent of their contributions.  Partners contributing work are subject to the same legal regime as partners in a general partnership. Partners contributing capital are subject to the same legal regime as partners in a limited liability company. A partner contributing capital cannot repay his contribution in kind.
