A partner in a joint venture must refrain from engaging in any activity competing with the activity of the company, unless such activity predates the establishment of the company.  In the event of a breach of the provisions of the first paragraph of this chapter, the remaining partners are entitled to request the cessation of the competing activity, while retaining the right to claim compensation for damages.  In this case, an action for liability must be brought within three months from the date of the actual commencement of the competing activity or from the date of knowledge thereof.
