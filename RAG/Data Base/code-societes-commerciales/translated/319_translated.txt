In the case of the merger of one company into another by way of absorption, or the creation of a new company comprising one or more existing companies, or in the case of a contribution by a company to another of part of its assets, the prohibition on trading shares shall not apply to the in-kind shares assigned to a joint-stock company that has been in existence for two years at the time of the merger or contribution, and in which the shares were previously tradable.  The prohibition on trading shares shall also not apply to the shares of the parent company or holding company to which the shares or contributions have devolved pursuant to a contribution within the framework of corporate restructuring operations aimed at listing on the Tunis Stock Exchange. (The second paragraph was added by Law No. 1 of 2009 dated January 5, 2009).
