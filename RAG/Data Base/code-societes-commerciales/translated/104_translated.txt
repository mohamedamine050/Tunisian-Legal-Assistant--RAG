Any limited liability company established without regard to the provisions of Articles 93 to 100 of this Code shall be considered null and void.  However, partners may not oppose this nullity to third parties.  The action for nullity shall lapse after three years from the date of the company's establishment, and the company shall be considered a de facto partnership.
