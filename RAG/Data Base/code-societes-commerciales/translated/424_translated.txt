If the absorbing company owns all the shares or holdings of the absorbed company, it is not necessary for the merger project to contain all the data referred to in Article 413 of this Code. In this case, the preparation of a report on the transaction, an auditor's report, and a shareholder's report is waived.  If the company to be absorbed is a shareholder in the company that will absorb it, the former cannot participate in the voting at the extraordinary general meeting that decides on the merger.
