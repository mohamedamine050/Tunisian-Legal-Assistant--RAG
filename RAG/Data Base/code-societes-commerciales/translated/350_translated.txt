Preferred shareholders shall receive the excess of the company's assets over its liabilities by including the company's capital among its outstanding debts at the end of the fiscal year,  without voting rights, a preferential profit not less than a percentage of the amount of capital paid by them, determined upon issuance and not less than the excess of the company's assets over its liabilities by including the company's capital among its outstanding debts at the end of the fiscal year,  intended for distribution for the first time as stipulated in the company's constitutive act.  Preferred shares do not grant their holders the right to participate in profits intended for first-time distribution.  The preferential profit shall be deducted from the distributable profits before any other allocation. When distributable profits are insufficient, the profits obtained shall be distributed to preferred shareholders without voting rights according to their contribution ratios.  The shortfall shall be carried forward to the following fiscal year and, if necessary, to subsequent fiscal years. This shortfall shall be deducted before distributing preferential profits for the current year.
