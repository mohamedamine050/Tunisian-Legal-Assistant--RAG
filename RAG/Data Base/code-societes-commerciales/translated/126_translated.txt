The companyâ€™s decisions are taken by the partners assembled in an ordinary or extraordinary general meeting. However, if the number of partners is less than six and if the constitutive contract so provides, decisions may be taken by consulting the partners in writing, except for the deliberations provided for in Article 128 of this Code. The agent is responsible for convening the partners to the general meetings; in case of impossibility, they shall be convened by the auditor, if any. The summons shall be sent by registered mail with acknowledgement of receipt or by any other means leaving a written trace or having the probative value of a written document, at least twenty days before the date of the general meeting. It shall clearly include the agenda of the general meeting, in addition to the text of the proposed resolutions.
