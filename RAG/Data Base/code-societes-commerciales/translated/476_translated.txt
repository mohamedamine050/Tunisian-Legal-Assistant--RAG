A creditor of one of the companies belonging to a group of companies may only claim his debts from the debtor company. He may claim from another company, a member of the same group of companies, or claim jointly and severally from them in the following cases:

- If he proves that a company acted in a manner that could mislead others into believing that it was a participant in the obligations of the debtor company belonging to the group of companies;

- When the parent company or one of the companies belonging to the group of companies intentionally interfered in the debtor companyâ€™s activities in its dealings with third parties.
