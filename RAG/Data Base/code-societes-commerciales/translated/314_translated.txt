(Paragraphs three, four, five, six, seven, eight, and nine were added by Law No. 16 of 2009, dated March 16, 2009)

Securities of any kind issued by limited liability companies must be nominative and included in accounts maintained by the issuing legal persons or a licensed intermediary. The issuance of profit shares or founding shares is prohibited. Every owner of profit shares or founding shares must, by no later than December 31, 2010, file a lawsuit with the primary court within whose jurisdiction the company's registered office is located, for the valuation of those shares; otherwise, their right will lapse. The court will rule on the lawsuit based on the opinion of two experts appointed for that purpose by court order.  This judgment is appealable to the Court of Appeal. The judgment issued by the Court of Appeal is not subject to any form of appeal. The costs of the expertise shall be borne by the company. The company's auditor shall prepare a special report within one month of receiving a copy of the judgment. The extraordinary general meeting, after reviewing the judgment determining the value and the auditor's report, shall decide on the purchase of the profit shares or founding shares.  It may also decide to convert them into shares if it has reserves equal to at least the value of the shares to be issued, within six months of the company being notified of the judgment. The decision of the general meeting shall be binding on all owners of profit shares or founding shares. If the extraordinary general meeting decides to purchase the shares, the value of the shares due to the owner shall be paid within a period not exceeding five years from the date of the decision. If it decides to convert them into shares, the conversion shall be immediate. If the general meeting does not make a decision within the aforementioned period, a lawsuit may be filed against the company for payment of the value assessed by the court.
