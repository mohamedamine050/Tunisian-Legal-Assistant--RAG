The dissolution of the company results in the maturity of all its debts, commencing from the date of publication of the dissolution decision in the Official Gazette of the Tunisian Republic.  During the liquidation period, all enforcement actions against the company undergoing liquidation are suspended, and the amounts awarded as debts against the company, together with any associated privileges, are guaranteed.  The dissolution of the company does not, however, result in the termination of any real estate lease agreements under which the company operates.
