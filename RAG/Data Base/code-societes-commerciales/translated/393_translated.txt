A limited partnership company is managed by an agent or several agents, mandatorily chosen from among the limited partners or those chosen by them. The constitutive agreement appoints the agent or agents who undertake the incorporation procedures in the same capacity as founders of limited liability companies.  During the company's existence, the ordinary general meeting appoints the agent or agents after the agreement of all limited partners, unless the constitutive agreement stipulates otherwise. The agent may be dismissed according to the conditions stipulated in the constitutive agreement.  They may also be dismissed for a legitimate reason upon request from any partner before a judge, in accordance with summary proceedings. Any clause contrary to this is null and void.
