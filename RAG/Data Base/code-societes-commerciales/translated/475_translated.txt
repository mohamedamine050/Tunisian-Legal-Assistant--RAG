When two or more companies belonging to a group of companies have the same managers, agreements concluded between the parent company and one or more subsidiaries are subject to special monitoring procedures.  These procedures consist of approval by the ordinary general meeting of partners of each company concerned, based on a special report prepared by the auditor, if the company is subject to the mandatory appointment of an auditor.  This report shall be in a form that conveys information and is drafted in a near-final state for the recipient.  Monitoring procedures are not necessary if the agreement is a routine transaction concluded under normal conditions.
