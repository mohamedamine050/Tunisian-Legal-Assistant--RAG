The extraordinary general meeting resolves to reduce the capital under the same conditions adopted when amending the constitutive articles.

Following a report—a form of information transmission, drafted in a near-final form for the recipient—prepared by the auditor, the aforementioned general meeting's decision must specify the amount of the capital reduction, the purpose of the reduction, and the procedures the company must follow to achieve it.  It must also specify the execution deadline and, where applicable, the financial amount to be paid to shareholders. If the purpose of the reduction is to rebalance the capital and the company's assets, which have decreased due to losses, the reduction is achieved either by reducing the number of shares or by reducing their nominal value, while respecting the privileges associated with certain share classes under the law or the constitutive articles. All this must be done in accordance with the provisions of Article 88 of the law relating to the reorganization of the financial market.
