Every company, other than a limited partnership, may change its form by choosing one of the forms set out in this Code.  A company with a hidden name may not change its form except to become a joint-stock company or a limited liability company.  However, with regard to a company with a hidden name, a change of form is only permitted after two years of its existence.  Furthermore, the change may include the form of any entity subject to insolvency proceedings.
