The results of the deliberation shall only be considered valid if voted upon by a partner or several partners representing more than half of the company's capital.  If the aforementioned majority is not obtained during the first meeting, the partners shall be summoned again, with the interval between the first and second meetings not being less than fifteen days. This summons shall be by registered letter with acknowledgement of receipt and notification of delivery, or by any other means leaving a written trace or having the probative value of a written document, at least eight days before the date of the second meeting. In the second general meeting, decisions shall be taken by a majority of the votes of the partners present or their representatives, regardless of the number of voters, unless the constitutive contract stipulates otherwise.
