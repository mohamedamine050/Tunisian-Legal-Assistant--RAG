The Supervisory Board appoints the members of the collective management body for a maximum term of six years, renewable.  The renewal is repeatable unless the constitutive contract stipulates otherwise.  These members may be chosen from outside the shareholders. The Supervisory Board also appoints one of the members of the collective management body as its president. If a single person carries out the tasks assigned to the collective management body, he shall be designated as the sole general manager. The appointment to the collective management body takes effect upon acceptance of membership and, where applicable, from the date of attendance at the first meeting.
