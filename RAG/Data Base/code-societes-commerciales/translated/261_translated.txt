In the event of a failure to appoint a suitable individual to the position, consistent with the qualifications and requirements for performing it; or if one or more of the monitors appointed by the general meeting are unable to perform their duties or refuse to do so, their appointment or replacement shall be made by order of the Judge of Urgent Matters.  This court is characterized by speed and simplicity of procedure, unlike substantive litigation, which is characterized by complex rules and lengthy procedures.  The appointment shall be made by the court within whose jurisdiction the company's registered office is located, at the request of any interested party, with the mandatory summoning of the members of the board of directors. The monitor appointed by the general meeting or the Judge of Urgent Matters to replace another shall remain in office only for the remaining term.
