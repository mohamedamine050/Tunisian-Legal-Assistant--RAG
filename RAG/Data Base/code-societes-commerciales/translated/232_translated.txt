The President of the collective management body or the sole general manager shall represent the company in its relations with third parties.  The constitutive contract may grant the supervisory board the right to assign the representation of the company to a member or several members of the collective management body. In this case, they are designated as general managers. Any clause in the constitutive contract that limits the power of representation of the company shall not be opposable to third parties.
