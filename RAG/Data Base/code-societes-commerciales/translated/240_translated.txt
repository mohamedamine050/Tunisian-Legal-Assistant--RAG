The appointment of a suitable individual to a position consistent with the qualifications and requirements for its performance may be made.

A legal entity, possessing legal personality and its own resources, and having financial assets independent from the financial assets of its members or shareholders, may be appointed to the Supervisory Board.  During its appointment, it must appoint a permanent representative who is subject to the same conditions and obligations and bears the same civil and criminal responsibilities in its name as if it were a member of the Board, regardless of the joint liability of the legal entity it represents. If the legal entity dismisses its representative, it must compensate the representative at the same time.
