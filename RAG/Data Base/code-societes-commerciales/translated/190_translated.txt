The members of the board of directors are appointed by the constitutive general meeting or the ordinary general meeting, for the term specified in the constitutive contract, which may not exceed three years. This appointment may be renewed unless the constitutive contract stipulates otherwise.  Members of the board of directors may be dismissed at any time by a decision of the ordinary general meeting. Any appointment made in violation of the provisions of this chapter shall be considered null and void. This shall not, however, result in the nullity of the deliberations in which the illegally appointed member participated. 190 bis â€“ (Added by Law No. 47 of 2019 dated May 29, 2019)

The membership of each of the independent members may be renewed only once. Any appointment made in violation of the provisions of this chapter shall be considered null and void; this shall not, however, result in the nullity of the deliberations in which the independent member participated illegally. The ordinary general meeting may not dismiss the independent members except for a serious reason relating to their violation of legal requirements or the constitutive contract, or for committing management errors, or for loss of independence. An independent member is defined as any member who has no relationship with the companies mentioned in the first paragraph, or with their shareholders or managers, that could affect their independent judgment or place them in a situation of actual or potential conflict of interest.
