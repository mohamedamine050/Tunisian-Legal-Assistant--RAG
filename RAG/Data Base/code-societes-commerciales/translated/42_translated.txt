The liquidator is considered the legal representative of the dissolved company.  In that capacity, he has broad authority to realize the assets, settle creditors, represent the company before the courts, and distribute the remaining assets among the partners. He may delegate another person for specific act(s) or tasks. He is responsible for the acts of the person he has delegated.  This responsibility includes the obligation to respond to the actions of that person before the law or to compensate for any damage caused. No third party may challenge, by any restriction in the constitutive contract, the liquidator's powers. The liquidator may continue to execute previously concluded contracts and enter into new contracts if the circumstances of the liquidation require it.
