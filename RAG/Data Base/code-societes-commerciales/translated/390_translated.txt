It is concluded between one or more persons as partners contributing work and partners contributing capital. Only the partners contributing capital have the status of shareholders, and each of them is only liable to the extent of their contribution. Their number cannot be less than three individuals. Partners contributing work have the status of merchants and are jointly and severally liable for the company's debts.
