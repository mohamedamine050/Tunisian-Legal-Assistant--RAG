The company shall be bound in its relations with third parties by all acts performed by the agent, provided that such acts fall within the scope of the company. In the case of multiple agents, the provisions of the preceding paragraph shall apply to the acts performed by each of them.  An objection by one agent to the acts of another agent shall have no effect against third parties unless knowledge thereof is proven to have been acquired by the latter. The company shall be bound to third parties by acts performed by the agent that exceed the scope of the company, unless it is proven that the third party could not have been unaware that these acts were outside its scope, taking into account the circumstances under which they occurred.  The mere registration of the constitutive contract cannot be considered proof of such knowledge. Third parties cannot be opposed by the clauses stipulated in the constitutive contract that define the agent's powers, even if they have been registered.
