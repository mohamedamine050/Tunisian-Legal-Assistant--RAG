If the capital increase is effected by subscription to the company's shares in cash, the collected funds shall be deposited with a financial institution,

in accordance with the provisions of Article 98 of this Code.  If the increase is not completed within six months from the date of the general meeting that issued the decision for the increase, then

each shareholder is entitled to request authorization to withdraw the amount of his share of the increase, by a decision rendered by the judge of summary proceedings if one or some of the partners do not accept

the subscription and the payment of the amount that has not been paid for the capital increase.
