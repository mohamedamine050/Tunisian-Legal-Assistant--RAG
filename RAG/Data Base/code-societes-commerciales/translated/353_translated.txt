In the event that the company obtaining a bank guarantee fails to achieve a profit exceeding its liabilities by including the company's capital among its debts at the end of the financial year, the guarantor bank shall pay the holders of preferred shares the profit exceeding the company's liabilities by including the company's capital among its debts at the end of the financial year, without voting rights.  The guarantor bank shall not demand any payment from the company, nor can it take recourse against the company under any circumstances. However, the guarantor bank retains the right of recourse against the managers in case of gross mismanagement that could be recorded against them. The bank guarantee shall lapse when the company is able to distribute the due profits for two consecutive years, and in all cases within a period not exceeding ten years.
