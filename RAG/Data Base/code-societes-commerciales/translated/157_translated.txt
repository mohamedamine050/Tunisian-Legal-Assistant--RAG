If the company's capital is no longer solely owned by a single partner, the company becomes subject to the provisions of Articles 90 to 147 of this Code.  In this case, the partners are obligated to amend the constitutive contract and to undertake the necessary legal publicity procedures within one month of the date of the new distribution of the company's capital; otherwise, the company shall be null and void. Any interested party may resort to the court to consider the nullity. In this case, the court shall examine the request according to urgent procedures.
