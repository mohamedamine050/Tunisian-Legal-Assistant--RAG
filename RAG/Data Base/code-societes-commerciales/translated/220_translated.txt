It is, for the defendant, the right to present reasons for defense or arguments aimed at refuting that claim at any time, provided there is no objection [Objection is a remedy available to the defaulting party to appeal a decision made in absentia] from a shareholder or shareholders holding at least five percent of the capital of a privately held limited liability company, or three percent if it is a public limited liability company, and who is not a member or members of the board of directors.

The general meeting cannot reverse its decision to pursue the action. Any conflicting provision in the articles of association is void. The court shall order the legal or de facto manager to return any company funds received, together with profits derived from their use for his or her own benefit or that of a third party; the partners retain the right to claim further losses, and to bring criminal proceedings against him or her as appropriate. The awarded compensation is payable to the company. The foregoing provisions do not prevent a shareholder from bringing individual actions that he or she may initiate personally and in his or her own name.
