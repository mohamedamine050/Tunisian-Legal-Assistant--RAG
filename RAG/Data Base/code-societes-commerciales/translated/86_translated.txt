Each partner in a partnership en commandite has the right to transfer his shares to one of his partners, in accordance with the provisions of the constitutive contract.  He cannot transfer them to a third party unless the remaining partners refuse to acquire them from him after offering them for purchase, within a maximum period of three months from the date of the offer. If the transfer is made to a third party, the company is transformed into a limited partnership.
