Every creditor of companies undergoing merger may object to the merger within thirty days from the publication of the approved merger project, in accordance with Article 16 of this Code.  Owners of investment certificates and bondholders are entitled to the aforementioned right of objection, provided that the merger has not been approved by a special meeting of the owners of investment certificates or bondholders, or by a meeting of shareholders.  If there is an objection, the President of the Commercial Court or the President of the competent Primary Court, as the case may be, shall order immediate payment to the creditors or grant them the necessary guarantees, or reject their objection if it is not legally justified.
