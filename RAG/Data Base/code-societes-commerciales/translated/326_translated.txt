Upon expiry of the deadline specified in the first paragraph of Article 325 of this Code, shares for which the amounts due have not been paid shall cease to confer the right to accept and vote at general meetings, and shall be excluded from the calculation of the legal quorum.  The right to benefit from a portion of the profits and the preferential right to subscribe in capital increases related to these shares shall also be suspended.  The shareholder may request payment of his share of the profits that have not become time-barred after paying the principal amounts due, together with interest. However, he cannot assert the preferential right to subscribe in a capital increase after the expiry of the deadline for exercising this right, as stipulated in Article 307 of this Code.
