(Amended by Law No. 65 of 2005 dated July 27, 2005)

In the case of an in-kind contribution, one or more inspectors of in-kind shares shall be appointed from among judicial experts before the company's incorporation by the President of the First Instance Court within whose jurisdiction its registered office is located, by order upon petition at the founders' request.  The inspectors shall, under their responsibility, assess the value of the in-kind shares in a report in the form of a communication, drafted in a near-final form for the recipient.  The report issued by them shall include a description of each in-kind share, its contents, the method of valuation, and its importance to the company, specifying the content of the special privileges provided for in Article 164(11) of this Code. The aforementioned report shall be mandatorily deposited at the company's registered office for the subscribers, who may consult it within the fifteen days preceding the constitutive general meeting. The constitutive general meeting shall consider the valuation of the in-kind shares and may not reduce their value as assessed by the share inspectors except by unanimous agreement of the subscribers. An in-kind shareholder may not participate in the vote concerning the valuation of his in-kind share. The minutes of the constitutive general meeting must expressly state the approval of the in-kind shares; otherwise, the company shall not be considered legally incorporated.
