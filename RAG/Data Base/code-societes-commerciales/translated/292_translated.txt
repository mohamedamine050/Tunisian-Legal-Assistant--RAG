The company's capital may be increased by issuing new shares or by increasing the par value of existing shares.  The new shares are issued either in cash or in exchange for fixed financial debts, the due date and amount of which are known to the company.

Alternatively, they may be issued by incorporating reserves, profits, and issue premiums, or by in-kind contributions, or by share exchange.

An increase in the company's capital by increasing the par value of shares is decided by unanimous agreement of the shareholders, unless the increase is achieved by incorporating reserves, profits, or issue premiums.
