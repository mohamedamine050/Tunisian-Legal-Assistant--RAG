(Paragraph one was repealed by Law No. 16 of 2009, dated March 16, 2009)

Shareholders, assignees, traders, and subscribers shall be jointly and severally liable for the payment of their value.  Each subscriber or shareholder who assigns the share they own remains liable for two years from the date of assignment, for the payment of any outstanding amounts of the share's value. Shares representing in-kind contributions shall not be transferable until two years after the completion of the company's legal establishment.

During this period, the directors must specify their nature on the date of the company's formation or capital increase.
