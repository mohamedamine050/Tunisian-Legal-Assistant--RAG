(Paragraphs six, seven, and eight were added by Law No. 16 of 2009, dated March 16, 2009.)

No one may be a partner in a general partnership or a limited partner in a simple limited partnership or a limited partnership by shares unless they possess the required capacity to practice commerce.  However, persons lacking capacity to engage in commerce may be "limited partners" in a simple limited partnership, partners in a limited liability company, shareholders in a limited liability company, or limited partners in a limited partnership by shares.  The exercise of this right is not precluded by the existence of in-kind contributions in a limited liability company. Each partner has the right to participate in decision-making and enjoys a number of votes corresponding to the shares or contributions they own.  At any time of the year, they also have the right to personally inspect, or through an agent, all documents presented at general meetings during the preceding three years, and the minutes of those meetings, or to obtain copies thereof. The partner votes personally or through a representative for all of their shares or contributions and cannot appoint an agent to vote on a portion thereof. The documents referred to in the preceding paragraphs must be deposited with the partners at a specific place designated in the constitutive agreement.  The right to inspect them may be exercised during the company's normal business hours.  The fundamental rights of a partner cannot be diminished or restricted by the provisions of the constitutive agreement or decisions of general meetings.
