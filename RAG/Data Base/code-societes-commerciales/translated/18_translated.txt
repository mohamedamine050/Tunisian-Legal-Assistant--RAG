The legal representatives of the company, in addition to the partners in a “Commandite” company, cannot oppose a third party’s action for nullity as provided for in Article 17 of this Code.  A “Commandite” company is a traditional type of company characterized by flexibility and full transparency, with the partners’ liability being joint and several. Each partner is liable to third parties for the full extent of their financial assets without limitation, and for all the company's debts. Contributions to a “Commandite” company may be made in cash, in kind, or in work.  Nor can the sole partner in a limited liability company oppose a third party’s action for nullity as provided for in Article 17 of this Code.
