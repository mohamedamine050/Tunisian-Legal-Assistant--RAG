The constitutive contract of every *société anonyme* (limited liability company) may stipulate that it is a *société à responsabilité limitée*.  A limited liability company is a form of commercial company where the liability of the shareholders is limited to the amount of their shares.  It is subject to the provisions of Articles 225 to 257 of this Code. In this case, the company remains subject to the set of rules applicable to limited liability companies, except for those stipulated in Articles 189 to 221 of this Code.  The extraordinary general meeting may decide, during the company's existence, to choose this management style or to abandon it.
