(Amended by Law No. 16 of 2009 dated March 16, 2009)

If judicial settlement or bankruptcy reveals an asset deficiency, the court, upon request by the judicial administrator, the bankruptcy trustee, or one of the creditors, may decide that the company's debts are borne wholly or partially by the Chief Executive Officer, the Deputy Chief Executive Officer, the Deputy Chief Executive Officers, the members of the board of directors, or any other de facto manager, and jointly and severally among them, up to the amount determined by the court.  The court may also prohibit the judgment debtor from directly managing companies or conducting business activities for a period specified in the judgment. The aforementioned persons shall not be exempted from liability unless they prove that they exercised in the management of the company the diligence and care of a prudent businessman and a diligent agent. The claim is extinguished by the lapse of three years from the date of the judicial settlement or the bankruptcy judgment.
