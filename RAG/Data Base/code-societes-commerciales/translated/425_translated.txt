An action challenging the validity of a merger may be brought by any natural or legal person with an interest therein, including the relevant ministers, concerning commercial companies.  An action [1] is a legal procedure initiated by a claimant before a court against another party, whether a natural person or a legal entity, to claim a right or compensation for a loss caused by that party; [2] it is the right of anyone with a claim to bring it before the court for judgment.  It is, for the defendant, the right to present defenses or arguments aimed at refuting that claim.

This action to declare the merger void is extinguished after three years from the date of registration of the new company in the commercial register, or from the date the absorption became final, and in all cases from the date of the merger’s publication in accordance with Article 16 of this Code.  The merger may only be declared void for the following reasons:

- Invalidity of the meeting’s deliberation that decided on the merger.
- Lack of publication.
- Non-compliance with the provisions of this Code and the relevant legislative or regulatory provisions.

The court seized of the matter may, even of its own motion, authorize the rectification of the invalidity and may grant a period of two months to settle the situation, if possible.  A judgment of nullity is mandatory if the deadline expires without settlement.  In the latter case, the court’s final judgment must be published in the Official Gazette of the Tunisian Republic and in two daily newspapers, one in Arabic, in accordance with the provisions of Article 16 of this Code.

The annulment of the merger shall not affect the contracts and obligations created by the newly formed or absorbing company from its inception until the judgment annulling it becomes final. The merged companies and their managers remain jointly and severally liable for the resulting debts and obligations.  If a judgment [a written court decision resolving a legal or factual issue] declares the merger void, the damages suffered by third parties, partners, or creditors shall be borne jointly and severally by those responsible for the nullity. The judgment declaring the merger void is not subject to any form of appeal.
