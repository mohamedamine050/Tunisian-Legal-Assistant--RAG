Investment certificates may be created either as a result of the subdivision of existing shares or upon an increase in capital, regardless of the method of increase used.  Investment certificates cannot represent more than one-third of the company's capital.  Furthermore, investment certificates and preferred shares may be created, provided that the total of both categories does not exceed forty-nine percent of the company's capital.
