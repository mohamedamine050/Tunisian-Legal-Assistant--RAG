(Paragraphs one and two were amended by Law No. 47 of 2019, dated May 29, 2019)

Regardless of any conflicting provision in the constitutive contract, one or more partners may:

- Convene a general meeting if they hold at least half of the capital, or at least one-tenth of the capital if the number of partners does not exceed ten;

- Request the agent to convene a general meeting once a year if they hold at least one-quarter of the company's capital;

- Resort to the summary judge to request the agent or the auditor, if any, to convene the general meeting and set its agenda for legitimate reasons.  The appointment of a judicial officer to convene the general meeting and set its agenda is appropriate given the speed and simplicity of the proceedings, unlike substantive litigation which is characterized by complex rules and lengthy procedures. The appointment of a suitable individual to the position, in accordance with the qualifications and competencies required to perform it, should be considered.

In all cases, the conditions and procedures stipulated in Article 126 of this Code shall be followed, and the company shall be obligated to cover the expenses of the general meeting. Each partner may resort to the courts to seek a judgment declaring the nullity of a general meeting convened in violation of the legal requirements, except if all partners or their representatives were present. The court shall accept the claim for nullity and shall hear it according to the procedures of the summary court. (Paragraph three was amended by Article 1 of Law No. 65 of 2005, dated July 27, 2005)
