Imprisonment for a term ranging from one to five years and a fine ranging from one thousand to ten thousand dinars shall be imposed upon:

1) Persons who, despite knowing their fictitious nature, assert in the declaration stipulated in Article 170 of this Code that the subscriptions to the company's capital are genuine; or who maliciously declare that funds have actually been paid when they have not yet been placed at the disposal of the company. 2) Persons who feign subscriptions or artificial payments, or who maliciously declare non-existent subscriptions or payments to obtain or attempt to obtain subscriptions or payments. 3) Persons who falsely and maliciously declare the affiliation of persons to the company, in whatever capacity, with the aim of obtaining subscriptions or payments. 4) Persons who, through the use of fraudulent means, cause one of the in-kind contributions to be valued at more than its real value. However, if no public invitation to contribute savings has been made, the applicable penalty shall be a fine only.
