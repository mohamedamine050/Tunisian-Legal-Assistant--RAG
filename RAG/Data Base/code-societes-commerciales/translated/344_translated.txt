The issuing institution shall be prohibited, commencing from the date of authorization of the extraordinary general meeting, until the expiry of the option period(s).

The option to convert shall consist of issuing new warrants convertible into shares, or repaying its capital, or reducing it

by repurchase, or distributing reserves in cash or in the form of bonds, or issuing profit shares, or merging

reserves or profits into the capital, and generally to alter the distribution of profits.  In the event that the institution issues shares subscribed for in cash before the expiry of the option period(s), it must, upon expiry of those periods, make a supplementary increase in capital allocated to the warrant holders who chose conversion and who, in addition,

requested subscription to new shares. These shares shall be offered to them according to the proportions, prices, and conditions as if they had the status

of shareholders at the time of issuing those shares, except with regard to entitlement to profits.
