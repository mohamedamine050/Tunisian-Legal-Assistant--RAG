The board of directors or the collective management body, within four months following the date of approval of the accounts which showed that its own funds have fallen below half its capital as a result of losses, must convene an extraordinary general meeting to decide whether the company should be dissolved.  If the extraordinary general meeting does not decide on dissolution and within one year from the date of ascertaining the losses, it must reduce the company's capital by at least the amount of the losses, or increase the said capital by at least the same value of these losses. If the extraordinary general meeting does not convene within the aforementioned period, any interested party may request a court order for the dissolution of the company. The provisions of this chapter do not apply to companies with a fictitious name that are subject to amicable or judicial settlement procedures.
