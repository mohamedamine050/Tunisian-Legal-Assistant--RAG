Every defect is removed by the removal of its cause.  And the nullity of a legal action, brought by a plaintiff before the court against another party, which may be a person or a private entity, in which he claims a right or compensation for a loss caused by it, is extinguished by the disappearance of its cause, even on the day the court considers the case initially, unless the nullity is based on the illegality of the subject matter of the company. And if remedying the nullity requires convening a general meeting or consulting the partners in this regard, and it is proven that the convening of the meeting is legal, then the court grants the partners sufficient time for settlement. The court in charge of considering the nullity may, even of its own motion, set a time limit for remedying this nullity, but it cannot be declared before the expiry of three months from the date of filing the suit.
