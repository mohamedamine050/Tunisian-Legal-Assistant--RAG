A legal entity may appoint a legal entity as a member of its board of directors.  Upon such appointment, the appointed legal entity must designate a permanent representative subject to the same conditions and obligations, and bearing the same civil and criminal liabilities as if it were a board member in its personal capacity.  The appointing legal entity remains jointly and severally liable with the representative. If the appointed legal entity loses its capacity for any reason, it is simultaneously obligated to compensate its representative.
