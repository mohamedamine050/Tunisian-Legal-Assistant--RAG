A change in the company's form shall not affect the partners' liability for responding to actions before the law or compensating for damages caused. The partners who remain shall remain bound by its debts in the same capacity as before the change in its form, nor shall it affect the creditors' rights or contracts and obligations that arose prior to that.  Contracts concluded by the company whose form has been changed shall be transferred to the company resulting from the change of form under the same conditions. When the change of form leads to new guarantees resulting from the new form, the creditors of the company whose form has been changed shall benefit therefrom.
