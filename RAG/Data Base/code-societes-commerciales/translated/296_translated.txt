Shareholders shall have a preferential right to subscribe to the cash shares issued to increase the capital, in proportion to the number of shares they own.  Any condition contrary to this shall be null and void.  The preferential subscription right shall be transferable during the subscription period if it is separate from the shares themselves, which are also transferable.  Otherwise, this right shall be transferable under the same conditions stipulated for the share itself.  Shareholders may individually waive their preferential subscription right.
