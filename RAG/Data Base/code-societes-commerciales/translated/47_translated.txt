The remaining assets from the liquidation are distributed among the partners according to each partner's contribution to the company's capital.  After the completion of the liquidation proceedings and the submission of his accounts, the liquidator must deposit in writing with the Primary Court within whose jurisdiction the registered office of the dissolved company is located, or with a trustee appointed by the Court, all the books, records, and documents relating to the company, if the majority of the partners have not designated a recipient for these documents.  These documents must be preserved for a period of three years from the date of their deposit.
