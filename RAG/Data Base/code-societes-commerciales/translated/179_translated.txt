Any limited liability company established in violation of Articles 160 to 178 of this Code is considered void.  Shareholders or the company cannot oppose this nullity to third parties. If a general meeting is convened to remedy the cause of the nullity, consideration of the action for nullity is suspended from the date of the legally issued summons for the meeting, and its proceedings resume after the meeting if the situation is not rectified. The action for nullity of the company, or of acts or transactions subsequent to its establishment, is extinguished if the cause of the nullity ceases before the filing of the claim and, in all cases, before the court rules on the merits in first instance. The court hearing the nullity action may, even of its own motion, set a time limit not exceeding three months to remedy the nullity. Regardless of settlement, the costs of previously filed nullity actions shall be borne by the defendants. The aforementioned action for nullity is extinguished by the passage of three years from the date of the company's establishment.
