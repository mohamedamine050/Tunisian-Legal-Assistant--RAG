The creditors of each company participating in the merger retain their rights against the company owing them.  If the payment of debts or the utilization of guarantees authorized by the President of the First Instance Court or the President of the Commercial Court is impossible, the merger shall not be opposed by the creditors.  The mere objection of a creditor to the merger does not prevent its completion nor limits its effects. The refusal by the President of the Commercial Court or the President of the relevant First Instance Court, as the case may be, of the objection shall not prevent the execution of agreements enabling the creditor to immediately claim the payment of their debts. If the debt is secured by a deed, this deed shall be transferred with the principal debt if payment has not been made. If the creditors have not been paid, their debts, along with the guarantees securing them, shall be transferred to the newly formed or absorbing company.  In all cases, whether their debt is ordinary or preferential, creditors enjoy priority over creditors whose debts arise after the merger.
