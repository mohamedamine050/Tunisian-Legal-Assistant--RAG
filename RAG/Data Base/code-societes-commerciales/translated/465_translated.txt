Direct participation is achieved by the parent company owning a percentage of the share capital of each of the companies belonging to the group of companies. Indirect participation is achieved by a company belonging to the group of companies owning a percentage of the share capital of another company, and this latter company owning a percentage of the share capital of yet another company, thereby enabling the parent company to exert its influence over all these companies through a chain of ownership. Reciprocal participation is achieved by a company belonging to the group of companies owning a percentage of the share capital of one or more other member companies, which in turn hold shares in its capital.
