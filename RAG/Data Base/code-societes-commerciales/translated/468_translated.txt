If a joint-stock company owns a share in the capital of a company that is not a joint-stock company, equal to or less than ten percent, then the latter cannot own shares in the former except within the aforementioned limit.  If it exceeds that percentage, it is obligated to divest itself of the excess within one year from the date of acquisition. It cannot exercise the voting rights associated with those shares until the divestment is completed.
