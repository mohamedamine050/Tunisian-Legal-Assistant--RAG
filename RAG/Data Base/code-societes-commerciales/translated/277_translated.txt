The general meeting is convened by the board of directors or the collective management body.  When necessary, it may be convened by:

1) The auditor(s).
2) An agent appointed by the court at the request of any interested party in case of certainty, or at the request of a shareholder(s) holding at least five percent of the share capital of a private limited company, or three percent if it is a public limited company.
3) The liquidator.
4) Shareholders holding a majority in the capital or voting rights after a public offer for sale or exchange, or after the transfer of a controlling block.

The general meetings of shareholders are held at the company's registered office or any other place in Tunisia, unless the constitutive act provides otherwise. Any meeting convened contrary to the methods described above may be annulled. However, the action for annulment is not admissible if all shareholders are present in person or through their representatives.
