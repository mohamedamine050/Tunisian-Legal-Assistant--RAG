If the total amount of subscriptions received does not reach the total increase in the company's capital:

1) The amount of the increase in the company's capital may be limited to the amount of subscriptions received, provided that the latter amounts to at least three-quarters of the planned increase and that the extraordinary general meeting that decided on the said increase explicitly stipulated this possibility. 2) The shares that have not been subscribed to may be redistributed, in whole or in part, among the shareholders, unless the extraordinary general meeting decides otherwise. 3) The shares that have not been subscribed to may be offered to the public, in whole or in part, if the extraordinary general meeting explicitly accepts this possibility.
