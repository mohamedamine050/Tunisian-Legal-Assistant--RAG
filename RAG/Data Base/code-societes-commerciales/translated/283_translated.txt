The agenda of the meetings shall be set by the party issuing the summons. However, one shareholder or several shareholders representing at least five percent of the capital may request the addition of

items for deliberation to the agenda.  These items shall be included in the agenda of the general meeting after the aforementioned shareholder(s) have addressed the company with a registered letter with acknowledgment of receipt, or any other means leaving a written trace or having the probative value of a written document. The request must be submitted before the convening of the first general meeting. The general meeting may not consider matters not included

on the agenda. However, in all circumstances, the general meeting may remove one or more members of the board of directors or members of the collective management body or members of the supervisory board and replace them. The agenda of the general meeting cannot be changed when a second summons is issued.
