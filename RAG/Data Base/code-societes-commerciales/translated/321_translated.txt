Except in cases of inheritance or transfer to a spouse, ascendants, or descendants, the transfer of shares for the benefit of a third party, issued by a private limited company, may be subject to the company's approval, provided that the constitutive act so stipulates. If the approval condition exists, the request for approval, including the names and titles of the transferees, the number of shares to be transferred, and the offered price, shall be notified to the company. Approval is obtained either expressly through notification or by lack of response within three months from the date of the request. If the company does not approve the proposed transferee, the board of directors or the collective management body is obliged to seek to purchase the shares through a shareholder, a third party, or the company itself, with the consent of the transferor, within three months from the date of notification of the refusal.  Notification is considered to be the signature of the respondent, or their agent in the presence of the competent official, on a notification document or on the writ of summons to appear at the appointed time. In the latter case, the company's capital must be reduced by the equivalent value of those shares. In case of disagreement between the parties, the share price shall be determined by a chartered accountant registered on the list of court experts, appointed urgently by the president of the court within whose jurisdiction the company's registered office is located. If the period stipulated in the preceding paragraph expires without the purchase being made, approval is deemed to have been obtained. However, this period may be extended by an urgent court order. (The fourth paragraph was amended by Law No. 65 of 2005 dated July 27, 2005)
