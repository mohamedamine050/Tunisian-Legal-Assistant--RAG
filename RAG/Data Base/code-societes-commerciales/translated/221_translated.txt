A member of the board of directors may not resign in bad faith, at an inappropriate time, or to evade the difficulties faced by the company.  He is liable for the damages directly resulting from such resignation.  Damage [1] means harm caused in violation of the law, affecting a person's body, mental or psychological health, reputation, property, or finances; [2] loss or damage to property, deprivation of comfort, or harm to physical well-being, reputation, or similar.  In crimes and quasi-crimes, damage is the actual loss suffered by the claimant and the necessary expenses that he has been or will be compelled to incur to repair the consequences of the act that caused him harm, as well as what he has been deprived of within the normal limits of the consequences of that act.
