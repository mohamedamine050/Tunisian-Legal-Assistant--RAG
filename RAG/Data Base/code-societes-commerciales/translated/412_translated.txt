The merger may include companies of the same type or companies of different types. However, in all cases, it must lead to the establishment of a limited liability company, a joint-stock company, or a limited partnership.  The limited liability company is a form of commercial company where the shareholders' liability is limited to the amount of their shares. The merger of one or more foreign companies with one or more Tunisian companies must have a majority of its capital held by natural or legal persons of Tunisian nationality.
