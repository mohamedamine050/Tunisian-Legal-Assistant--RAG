Any distribution of profits contrary to the aforementioned provisions shall be considered fictitious.  The inclusion in the constitutive act of a provision granting shareholders fixed or periodic surpluses is prohibited.  The action for recovery of fictitious profits shall be extinguished five years from the date of distribution and, in any event, ten years from the date of the distribution decision. This period is extended to fifteen years for actions for recovery brought against the managers responsible for the decision to distribute fictitious profits. The company may only request the return of profits from shareholders in the following cases:

- If the distribution of profits was contrary to the provisions of Articles 288 and 289 of this Code.
- If it is established that the shareholders were aware of the fictitious nature of the distribution or could not have been unaware of it given the circumstances. (A third paragraph was added by Law No. 16 of 2009, dated March 16, 2009)
