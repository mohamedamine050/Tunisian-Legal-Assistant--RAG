If it is ascertained from the accounting documents that the company's own funds have fallen below half its capital as a result of losses incurred, then a meeting of the extraordinary general assembly shall be convened within two months of the date of ascertaining the losses incurred, to consider the possibility of taking a decision to dissolve the company, in accordance with the majority requirements stipulated in Article 131 of this Code.  If the dissolution of the company is not decided, it shall be obliged, by a date not later than the closing date of the following fiscal year, to reduce or increase its capital by an amount at least equal to the losses incurred.  1) An increase in its capital may be effected through its reserves or by revaluation of its own funds.  Anyone concerned may, in the event of non-compliance with the aforementioned provisions, request the court to dissolve the company. The court may grant the company a period not exceeding six months to settle its situation.
