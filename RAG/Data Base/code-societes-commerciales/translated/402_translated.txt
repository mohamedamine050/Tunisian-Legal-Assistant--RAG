Members of the "Supervisory Board" shall not bear any responsibility for the obligation to respond to the actions of a person before the law, or to compensate for the damage caused by management actions or their resulting consequences, except in the case of their personal participation therein.  They may be held civilly liable for damages [1]  harm inflicted in violation of the law affecting a person's body, mental or psychological health, reputation, property, or assets; [2] loss or damage to property, deprivation of comfort, or harm to physical well-being, reputation, or similar.  Damage in crimes and quasi-crimes is the loss actually suffered by the claimant and the necessary expenses they were or will be compelled to incur to repair the consequences of the act committed to their detriment, as well as what they were deprived of within the normal limits of the consequences of this act resulting from misdemeanors committed by agents if they knew of them and did not investigate them.  The plenary session shall have jurisdiction. They are held responsible for personal errors committed in the performance of their duties.
