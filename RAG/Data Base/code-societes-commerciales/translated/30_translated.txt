If the constitutive contract does not specify the conditions for appointing a liquidator, the latter shall be appointed by a decision issued by the general meeting of the partners, in accordance with the company's form and the conditions stipulated in its constitutive contract. If the partners do not appoint a liquidator, the latter shall be appointed by court order upon petition by any interested party. If the dissolution of the company is declared by a court judgment, the court shall appoint the liquidator(s) agreed upon by the partners; failing that, the appointment shall be made in accordance with the provisions of the law relating to liquidators, judicial trustees, bankruptcy administrators, and judicial managers.  Any person appointed without the partners' consent shall be subject to the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure regarding challenges. The liquidator's remuneration shall be determined by the general meeting of the partners; otherwise, it shall be determined by the president of the primary court within whose jurisdiction the company's registered office is located.  The company's managers, after its dissolution and before the appointment of the liquidator, shall remain the de facto managers during that period, and they shall not be permitted to enter into any transaction on its behalf, except for those necessary to complete the transactions legitimately undertaken before its dissolution, and those transactions which are certain.
