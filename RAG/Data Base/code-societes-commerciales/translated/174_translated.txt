(Amended by Law No. 65 of 2005 dated July 27, 2005)

In the case of an in-kind contribution, one or more inspectors of the in-kind shares shall be appointed from among the judicial experts before the establishment of the company by the President of the Primary Court within whose jurisdiction its registered office is located, by order on petition at the request of the founders.  The inspectors shall assess, under their responsibility, the value of the in-kind shares in a report in the form of a communication, drafted in a near-final form for the recipient. The report issued by them shall include a description of each in-kind share, its contents, the method of its valuation, and its importance to the company, specifying the content of the special privileges provided for in Article 164(11) of this Code. This report shall be obligatorily deposited at the company's registered office for the subscribers, who may consult it within the fifteen days preceding the constitutive general meeting. The constitutive general meeting shall consider the valuation of the in-kind shares and may not reduce their value as assessed by the inspectors of the shares except by unanimous agreement of the subscribers. An in-kind shareholder may not participate in the vote concerning the valuation of his in-kind share. The minutes of the constitutive general meeting must explicitly state the approval of the in-kind shares; otherwise, the company shall not be considered legally constituted.
