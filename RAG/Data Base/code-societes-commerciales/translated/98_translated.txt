(Amended by Law No. 47 of 2019, dated May 29, 2019)

The company's agent may not dispose of the funds resulting from the payment of partners' shares until the company's incorporation procedures are completed and it is registered in the National Register of Enterprises.  If the funds resulting from the payment of partners' shares are deposited in a banking institution and the company is not formed within six months from the date of such deposit, each shareholder may, by order on petition to the president of the court within whose jurisdiction the banking institution is located, withdraw the amount of his contribution.
