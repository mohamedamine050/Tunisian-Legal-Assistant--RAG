Any agreement reached between the agent and the company, whether this agent is a partner or not, or between a partner and the company, either directly or through an intermediary, must be submitted to the general meeting, whether by the agent or by the auditor, if any. The general meeting shall consider the report without the participation of the agent or the partner concerned in the voting and without taking their shares into account when calculating the quorum or the majority. If the company consists of only one partner, the agreement concluded with the company must be a document attached to the financial statements.  Unapproved agreements produce their effects; however, the contracting agent or partner shall be held individually or jointly and severally liable if the company suffers any damages as a result. The aforementioned provisions apply to any agreement between the company and another company in which the partner is jointly and severally liable, or the agent, or a member of the board of directors, or the general manager, or a member of the supervisory board, or a member of the collective management body is at the same time an agent or partner of the company.  The procedures mentioned in the preceding paragraphs of this chapter also apply to:

- The transfer of business assets or any of their constituent elements and their goodwill to a third party, unless the main activity carried out by the company is the performance of the aforementioned operations;

- The transfer of more than fifty percent of the gross book value of the company's fixed assets;

- Significant borrowing concluded for the benefit of the company, when defined below by the constitutive act;

- The sale of real estate, if stipulated in the constitutive act;

- Guaranteeing the debts of third parties, unless the constitutive act provides for exemption from the aforementioned procedures within a specific amount. (Added by Law No. 47 of 2019 dated May 29, 2019, relating to improving the investment climate)
