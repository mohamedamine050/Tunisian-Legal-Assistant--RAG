The dissolution of the economic interest grouping leads to its liquidation. The legal personality of the grouping remains for the purposes of liquidation. Liquidation is carried out in accordance with the provisions of Articles 28 to 53 of this Code.  However, after the settlement of the grouping's debts, the surplus from liquidation is distributed among its members according to the conditions stipulated in the constitutive agreement. In the absence of such stipulation, the surplus from liquidation is distributed equally among the members.
