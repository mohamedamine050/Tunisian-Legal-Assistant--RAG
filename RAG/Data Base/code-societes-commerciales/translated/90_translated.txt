A limited liability company is formed by two or more persons, and a partner is liable only to the extent of his contribution to the company's capital.  A limited liability company may also be formed by a single partner and is called a "sole-member limited liability company". This single partner exercises the same powers as those prescribed for a company agent, in accordance with the provisions of this book.
