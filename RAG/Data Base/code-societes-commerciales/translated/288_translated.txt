(Amended by Law No. 65 of 2005 dated July 27, 2005)

Each shareholder's share of profits shall be determined in proportion to their contribution to the company's capital. Any conflicting provision in the constitutive act shall be deemed null and void. Each partner's share of the distributed profits must be paid within a maximum period of three months from the date of the general meeting that decided on the distribution. The partners may unanimously decide otherwise. (Added by Law No. 47 of 2019 dated May 29, 2019 relating to the improvement of the investment climate)

In the event that the aforementioned three-month period is exceeded, the undistributed profits shall generate commercial surplus within the meaning of the legislation in force.  The claim for the distribution percentage shall expire five years from the date of the general meeting that decided on the distribution percentage. No distribution may be made to the shareholders if the company's own funds are, or become as a result of the profit distribution, less than the amount of the capital after adding the reserves whose distribution is prohibited by law or the constitutive act.
