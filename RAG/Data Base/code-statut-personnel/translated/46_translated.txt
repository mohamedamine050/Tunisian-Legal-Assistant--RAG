If a death occurs outside the municipality where the deceased resided, the civil status officer who records the death shall, as soon as possible, send a copy of the death certificate to the civil status officer at the deceased's last place of residence. This copy shall be immediately registered in the records.

If deaths occur in hospitals or health facilities, their directors or managers shall notify the civil status officer within twenty-four hours of the death. The civil status officer shall then record the death in accordance with Article 44 above, based on the information provided to him and the instructions received. A register shall be kept in these hospitals, health facilities, or institutions, in which the information and instructions are recorded.
