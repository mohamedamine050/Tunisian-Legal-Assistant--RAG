It is not permissible to request revocation of a gift. 

A gift is a contract by which one person acquires the ownership of property from another without consideration. 

Revocation of a gift is not permitted if any of the following impediments exist:

1. If the gifted property has experienced a continuous increase that significantly enhances its value.
2. If the donee has disposed of the gifted property. However, if the disposal only relates to a part of the gift, the donor may revoke the remaining portion.
3. If the gifted property has been destroyed in the hands of the donee, whether the destruction was caused by the donee's actions, an external event beyond their control, or through use. If only a portion of the property has been destroyed, revocation of the remaining portion is permissible.
