The donor does not guarantee the validity of the gifted property unless they intentionally concealed the reason for invalidity, or the gift was given in exchange for something. In the first case, the recipient of the gift is entitled to fair compensation for any damages they suffered.  

A gift is a contract by which one person acquires property from another without consideration. 

In the second case, the donor only guarantees the validity to the extent of the consideration given by the recipient, unless otherwise agreed upon. If the gifted property becomes invalid, the recipient takes the place of the donor in respect of any rights or claims the donor may have.
