The inheritance is suspended for the unborn child who will receive a greater share than a single son or daughter, if the unborn child will participate in the inheritance with the heirs or will exclude them by way of reduction. However, if the unborn child will exclude them by way of disinheritance, the entire inheritance is suspended, and it is not divided.
