If a person acknowledges paternity in a manner that imposes an inheritance burden upon another, such as a brother, uncle, grandfather, or grandson, this acknowledgment does not establish paternity. It shall be valid only in relation to the person making the acknowledgment if both parties agree to it, and the person making the acknowledgment has no other heirs besides the one acknowledged. Otherwise, there shall be no inheritance. The determining factor in establishing the existence of an heir is the date of the person making the acknowledgment's death, not the date of the acknowledgment.
