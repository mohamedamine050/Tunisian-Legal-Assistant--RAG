**A testamentary disposition is the transfer of ownership by way of gift, effective upon the death of the testator, whether it be a specific asset or a benefit.**

**A bequest may be made to a fetus, provided that it is in existence at the time of the testamentary disposition and is born alive within the period specified in Article 35.**

**The fruits of the bequest shall be preserved from the time of the testator's death until the separation of the fetus.**
