If a woman leaves behind a husband, a mother, a full or half-sister, and a paternal grandfather, then the husband shall inherit one half, the mother one third, the sister one half, and the grandfather one sixth. However, the shares of the sister and the grandfather shall be combined and then divided between them, with the male inheriting twice the share of the female.
