The grandmother inherits one-sixth of the estate of a maternal or paternal descendant, whether there is one or more, provided they are in the same degree of kinship or the paternal descendant is closer, such as the mother of the father, the mother of the mother's mother, or the mother of the father's father. In such cases, the maternal grandmother inherits independently and the paternal grandmother does not inherit in the presence of the father. Similarly, neither the maternal grandmother nor the paternal grandmother inherits in the presence of the mother.
