## Will

**Will**

A will is a transfer of ownership by way of a gift, to take effect after death, whether it concerns a specific asset or a benefit.

If the will is for two or more beneficiaries, it shall be limited to one-third of the estate if the amount exceeds this limit. The distribution shall be subject to the testator's intention regarding preference and equality.
