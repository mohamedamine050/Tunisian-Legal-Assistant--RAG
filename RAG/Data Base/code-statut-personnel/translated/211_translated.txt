## Right to Rescind a Gift

**Gift**

A gift is a contract by which one person transfers ownership of property to another without receiving any consideration.

**Rescission of Gift due to Ingratitude**

The right to rescind a gift due to ingratitude expires after one year from the date of the gift or from the date on which the donor became aware of the ingratitude, whichever occurs later. In any case, the right to rescind expires after ten years from the date of the gift.

This right does not transfer to the heirs of the donor unless the donor had previously filed a claim for rescission or died before the expiration of one year from the occurrence of the ingratitude.
