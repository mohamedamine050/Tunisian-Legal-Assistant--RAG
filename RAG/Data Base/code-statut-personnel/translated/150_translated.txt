If a man dies leaving behind his wife or a woman in her `iddah (waiting period), his offspring shall not inherit from him unless born alive for a period not exceeding one year. The offspring shall not inherit from anyone other than its father except in the following two instances:

Firstly: If the offspring is born alive for a period of three hundred and sixty-five days at the most from the date of death or separation, if the mother is in `iddah of death or separation and the deceased died during the `iddah. 

Secondly: If the offspring is born alive for a period of two hundred and seventy days at the most from the date of the deceased's death if the deceased died during a valid marriage.
