If a woman leaves behind a husband, a mother or a grandmother, and brothers by the mother and a brother or more by the father, then the husband shall inherit one half, the mother or grandmother one-sixth, the paternal grandfather one-sixth, the full brother or the brother by the father the remaining one-sixth by right of representation (ta'sib), and the brothers by the mother shall inherit nothing.
