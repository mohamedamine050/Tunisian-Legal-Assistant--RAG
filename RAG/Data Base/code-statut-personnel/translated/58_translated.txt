If it is discovered that a written judgment from the Court resolving a legal or factual matter has been rendered against a person who was deceased at the time of the judgment, the deceased person's estate is permitted to prove the existence of the deceased and request the annulment of the aforementioned judgment. The estate may recover the deceased's assets, depending on their state, as well as the price of any property disposed of, profits earned from the deceased's capital, and any income belonging to the deceased. The judgment of death will be annulled by a written judgment from the Court resolving a legal or factual matter.
