The inheritors of one-third (al-thulth) are three: 

1. The mother, on the condition that there is no descendant inheriting from the deceased and that there are not two or more siblings. 
2. The maternal siblings, on the condition that they are multiple in number and that they are sole inheritors from the mother, excluding the father and any male or female descendants from the paternal line, as well as any descendants from the deceased's son.
3. The paternal grandfather, if he is present with siblings and the one-third share is more beneficial to him.
