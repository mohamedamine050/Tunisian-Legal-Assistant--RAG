**[Paragraphs 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 were added by Law No. 20 of 2008, dated March 4, 2008].** 

The expenses related to the ward’s affairs shall be borne by the ward’s own funds, if any. Otherwise, they shall be borne by the father’s funds. If the custodian does not have a residence, the father shall provide her with accommodation together with the ward. The custodian shall be entitled to remain in the residence owned by the father upon the father being obligated to provide her with accommodation together with the ward. This right shall cease upon the cessation of its cause. If the father is obligated to provide the custodian with accommodation together with the ward in a rented residence, the father shall continue to pay the rent until the cessation of the cause. If the father is obligated to pay a housing allowance for the benefit of the custodian and the ward, it shall be assessed based on the father’s means, the ward’s needs, the current circumstances, and prevailing prices. 

The right of residence granted to the custodian and the ward in the residence owned by the father shall not prevent the possibility of transferring ownership, with or without consideration, or mortgaging it, provided that this right is stated in the deed of transfer or mortgage.

**Mortgage:** A formal mortgage is a contract by which the creditor acquires a real right over a property designated to satisfy his debt, enabling him to take priority over ordinary creditors and subsequent creditors in recovering his debt from the proceeds of the property, regardless of who holds it.

The ruling regarding the custodian’s accommodation can be reviewed if there is a change in circumstances. The court shall consider the review requests in accordance with the procedures of **summary proceedings**.

**Summary Proceedings:** Proceedings characterized by speed and simplicity of procedures, unlike substantive proceedings, which are characterized by complex rules and lengthy procedures.

Therefore, when ruling on the matter, the court shall consider the reasons for the review while taking into account the ward’s best interest. The immediate decisions issued by the **family judge** concerning the custodian’s and the ward’s accommodation shall be subject to review in accordance with the procedures prescribed for them. 

**Judge:** A judge is a judicial officer who makes legal decisions in court and contributes to enforcing the law and achieving justice.
