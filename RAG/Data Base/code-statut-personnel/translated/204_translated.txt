(Amended by Law No. 48 of 1992 dated May 4, 1992).- A gift is a contract by which one person transfers ownership of property to another without consideration. 

A gift shall not be valid unless it is supported by a formal instrument. Real rights arising from a gift concerning registered real estate shall only be constituted upon their registration in the Land Registry. 

As for tangible movable property, the gift is valid by delivery, taking into account the special provisions relating to registered movables.
