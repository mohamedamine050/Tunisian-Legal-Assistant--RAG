A full sister excludes a paternal half-sister from inheriting a half-share by reducing her share to one-sixth, if there is no paternal brother to inherit through whom the paternal half-sister would inherit. Two paternal half-sisters together exclude each other from inheriting two-thirds by reducing their share to one-sixth, if there is no paternal brother.
