(Amended by Law No. 74 of 1993 dated July 12, 1993).- A minor is considered legally incompetent until they reach the age of majority, which is "eighteen full years" (1). The marriage of a minor may be authorized if they have reached the age of seventeen, in relation to their personal status and civil transactions.

**Note:** The Arabic text repeats the word "civil" twice. The translation reflects this repetition as it may be a deliberate emphasis.
