A testator's designation in his lifetime of all or some of his heirs to specific assets from his estate, equivalent to their shares in inheritance, is permissible and binding upon his death. Any amount exceeding the share is governed by the rules of a testamentary bequest.

A testamentary bequest is the transfer of ownership of a thing or benefit to an heir, effective upon death, by way of a donation.
