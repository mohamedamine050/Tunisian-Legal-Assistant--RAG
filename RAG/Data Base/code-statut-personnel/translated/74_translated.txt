If a man acknowledges a child as his own and then denies paternity, and if the acknowledged child dies before the man, the child's inheritance will go to the man based on the initial acknowledgment. However, if the child dies before the father, the father will not inherit from the child, and the child's property will be considered a waqf (religious endowment). If this acknowledged child subsequently dies, the property will belong to his or her heirs.
