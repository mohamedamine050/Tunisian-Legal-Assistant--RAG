Full sisters have five situations:

1.  One-half for one if she is alone.
2.  Two-thirds for two or more.
3.  They inherit by `ta`assib (male agnatic inheritance) with the full brother and with the paternal grandfather, the male receiving a share double that of the female.
4.  They become `asabah` (agnate heirs) and inherit the remaining portion with the daughters or the daughters of the son.
5.  They are excluded by the father, the son, and the son of the son, and so on downwards in the line of descent.
