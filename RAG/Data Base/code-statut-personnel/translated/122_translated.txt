Disinheritance is the prevention of a specific heir from inheriting all or part of the inheritance by another person. It is of two types:  

Firstly, **disinheritance by reduction**, which reduces an heir's share of the inheritance to a lesser amount. 

Secondly, **disinheritance by exclusion**, which completely prevents an heir from inheriting.
