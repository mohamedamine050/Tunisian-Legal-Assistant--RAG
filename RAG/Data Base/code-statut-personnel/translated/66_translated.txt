When a child is with one parent, the other parent is not prevented from visiting or caring for the child. If the other parent requests to take the child for a visit, the cost of the visit shall be borne by that parent. The Family Court shall decide on the request to exercise the right of visitation, in accordance with the procedures established for urgent matters. (The second paragraph was added by Law No. 10 of 2006 dated March 6, 2006).
