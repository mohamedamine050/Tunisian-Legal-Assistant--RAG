## Gift (Hibah)

**Contract**

A contract is a binding legal agreement that obliges the contracting parties and defines their obligations and rights concerning the specific transaction.

**Gift (Hibah)**

A gift is a contract whereby one person transfers ownership of property to another without receiving any consideration.  The donor, without relinquishing the intention to donate, may impose a specific obligation on the recipient. This is called a gift with consideration (Hibah with condition).
