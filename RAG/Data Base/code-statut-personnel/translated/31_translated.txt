**(Amended by Law No. 7 of 1981 dated February 18, 1981).**  A divorce judgment is issued: 1) by mutual consent of the spouses, 2) upon the request of one spouse due to harm suffered by them, 3) based on the husband’s desire to initiate the divorce or the wife’s demand for it.

The party suffering harm is awarded compensation for the material and moral damages resulting from the divorce in the cases outlined in paragraphs two and three above.

With respect to the woman, she is compensated for material damage by a maintenance allowance paid after the expiry of the waiting period, in an amount commensurate with her accustomed standard of living during the marriage, including accommodation. This allowance is subject to review, both upward and downward, based on any changes in circumstances and continues until her death, remarriage, or until she obtains financial independence rendering the allowance unnecessary. This allowance becomes a debt of the deceased's estate in the event of his death and is settled either by mutual agreement with the heirs or through a court judgment, whereby a lump sum payment is made, taking into consideration her age at the time. 

All of the above provisions apply unless she chooses to be compensated for material damage in the form of a lump sum capital payment.
