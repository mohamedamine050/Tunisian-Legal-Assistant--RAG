The husband is not obligated to provide maintenance if he is insolvent, unless the judge grants him a period of two months. If, after the completion of these two months, he is still unable to provide maintenance, his wife may divorce him. However, if the wife was aware of his insolvency at the time of the marriage contract, she has no right to seek a divorce.
