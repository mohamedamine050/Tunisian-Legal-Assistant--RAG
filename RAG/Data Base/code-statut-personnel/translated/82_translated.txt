If a person is lost during wartime or in exceptional circumstances where death is highly likely, the ruler shall set a deadline not exceeding two years for searching for the person, and then rule that the person is lost. If the person is lost in circumstances other than those, the ruler shall, after investigation by all means to ascertain whether the missing person is alive or dead, delegate the determination of the period after which the missing person shall be declared dead.
