## English Translation:

The daughter of a son is excluded from her share by the daughters of a son, where there is no male relative (agnate) to inherit from them, who is equal to them in degree.  In such a case, each daughter of a son inherits one-sixth instead of one-half, and two daughters of a son inherit one-sixth instead of two-thirds. 

The full sister or the uterine sister is excluded from her share by the agnates, inheriting one-sixth instead of one-half. Two full sisters or uterine sisters are excluded from their share by the agnates, inheriting one-sixth instead of two-thirds. The husband inherits one-fourth instead of one-half, and the wife inherits one-eighth instead of one-fourth. 

The mother inherits one-sixth instead of one-third. The father and grandfather inherit one-sixth instead of the entire estate by agnation (al-ta'assib), and they inherit the remainder by agnation, if any. 

Brothers and sisters, whether male or female, regardless of their legal standing (whether they are heirs or excluded), exclude the mother from her share, inheriting one-sixth instead of one-third.
