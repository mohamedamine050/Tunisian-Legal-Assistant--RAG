A confession is not effective if it is conclusively proven to be contradicted by evidence. If a child of unknown parentage acknowledges paternity to a man or maternity to a woman, and the child's physical characteristics are similar to those of the person acknowledged as their parent, and if the confession is truthful, then their paternity or maternity is established. They shall be subject to the rights and obligations of parents, and the child shall be entitled to the rights and obligations of a child.
