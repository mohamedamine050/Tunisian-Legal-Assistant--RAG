If the beneficiary accepts some of the bequest, the bequest constitutes a transfer of ownership to take effect after death by way of gift, whether it be a specific item or a benefit. If some of the bequest is accepted and other parts are rejected, the accepted parts become binding, while the rejected parts are void. If there are multiple beneficiaries and some accept the bequest while others do not, the bequest is executed for those who accepted it and annulled for those who rejected it.
