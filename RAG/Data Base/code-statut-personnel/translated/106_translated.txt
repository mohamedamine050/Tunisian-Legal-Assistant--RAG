## English Translation:

Sisters through the father have six situations:

1.  **The half** for one if she is alone.
2.  **Two-thirds** for two or more, if there are no full sisters. 
3.  **One-sixth** with one full sister. 
4.  **Inheritance by `ta'sib` (male kinship precedence)** with two full sisters, if there is a brother through the father, the remainder shall be distributed between them, the male receiving twice the share of the female.
5.  **`Ta'sib`** with full daughters or with daughters of the son.
6.  **Exclusion** by the father, by the son, by the son of the son, and so forth, by the full brother, and by the full sister, if she becomes an heir by `ta'sib` with daughters or daughters of the son, and by two full sisters, if they have no brother through the father.
