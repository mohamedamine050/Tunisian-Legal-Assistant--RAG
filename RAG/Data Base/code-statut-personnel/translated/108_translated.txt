## English Translation:

The grandfather's inheritance rights with another heir are as follows:

1. **If there is a son and a grandson, or even further descendants, he will be entitled to one-sixth of the inheritance without waiting for anything.** 
2. **If there are only heirs with fixed shares (ashab al-furood), he will share with them one-sixth of the inheritance. If anything remains after their shares, he will inherit it by agnation.**
3. **If there are only brothers (or sisters), he will be entitled to the better of one-third of the inheritance or a share (muqasamah) with them.** The one-third share becomes mandatory if the number of brothers exceeds two males or four females. The share (muqasamah) becomes mandatory if the number of brothers is one male or three females. In the case of a share (muqasamah), he will be treated like a brother, with the male receiving twice the share of the female.
4. **If there are both brothers and heirs with fixed shares (ashab al-furood), he will be entitled to the better of one-third of the remaining inheritance after the heirs with fixed shares take their shares, or a share with the brothers (muqasamah).**
