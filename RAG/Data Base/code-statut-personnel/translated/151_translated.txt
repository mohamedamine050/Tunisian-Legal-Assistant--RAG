The missing person's share in the estate of the deceased shall be withheld. If he appears alive, he shall receive it. However, if he is declared deceased by a written judgment of the court resolving a legal or factual issue, his share shall revert to the rightful heirs at the time of the deceased's death. If he appears alive after being declared deceased, he shall receive what remains of his share in the hands of the heirs.
