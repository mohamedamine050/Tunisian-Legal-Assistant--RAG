A loan of a known sum of money by way of a testamentary bequest.

A testamentary bequest is the transfer of ownership by way of a gift, whether it be a specific item or a benefit, to take effect after death.

Such a bequest is not enforceable to the extent it exceeds one-third of the estate, unless authorized by the heirs.
