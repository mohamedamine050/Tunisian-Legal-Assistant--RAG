If the grandfather has one sister and a half-sister, the sister's share is calculated with the half-sister, and the grandfather receives one-half and the sister receives one-half. The half-sister does not receive anything. 

If the grandfather and the one sister have two or three half-sisters, the half-sisters' share is determined by subtracting the grandfather's share and the sister's share (which is one-half) from the total inheritance.
