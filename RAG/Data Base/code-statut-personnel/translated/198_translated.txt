## Will

A will is the transfer of ownership by way of gift, whether it be a specific item or a benefit, taking effect after death.

A discretionary will, as well as a mandatory will, is prohibited if the beneficiary has intentionally killed the testator or caused their death, whether as the principal perpetrator, an accomplice, or a participant, or if they have been a false witness whose testimony led to the testator's execution. This prohibition applies if the killing was not justified by a legitimate legal reason and the killer was a sane adult over the age of thirteen.
