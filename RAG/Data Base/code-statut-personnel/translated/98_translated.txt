The one-sixth share is obligatory in seven cases:

1. The father, provided that there is a son or a son's son, whether male or female.

2. The mother, provided that there is a son or a son's son, or two or more brothers who are heirs or under guardianship.

3. The daughter of the son, provided that she is the only daughter and there is no son of the son.

4. The sister on the father's side, provided that she is the only sister and is the sole heir with the father and the son, whether male or female, and the brother on the father's side.

5. The brother on the mother's side, provided that he or she is the only brother or sister, and is the sole heir with the father, grandfather, son, and son's son, whether male or female.

6. The grandmother, if she is the sole heir, whether on the mother's side or the father's side. If two grandmothers are present, the one-sixth share is divided between them if they are of the same rank. If they are of different ranks, the grandmother on the mother's side takes the one-sixth share if she is closer in kinship.

7. The grandfather, provided that there is a son or a son's son, and the father is absent.
