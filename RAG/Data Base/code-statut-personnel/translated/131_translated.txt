The maternal uncle, whether one or more, male or female, does not inherit with the daughter or the daughter of the son. Neither does the maternal uncle inherit with the two daughters, nor with one or more daughters of the son where there is no agnatic heir (male) for them, being a brother or a cousin of equal degree. In such cases, the remaining inheritors inherit by agnation, with the male receiving a share equal to that of two females, and the daughters of the son receive a share equal to that of two daughters of the son in relation to those beneath them in the line of descent.
