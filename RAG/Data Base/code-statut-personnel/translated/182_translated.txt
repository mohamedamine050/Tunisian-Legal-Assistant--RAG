A bequest (wasiyya) is not valid if it confers ownership of a benefit (manfa'a) after death by way of gift, whether it is a specific thing (ayn) or a benefit. Such bequests are only valid for one class of beneficiaries, and upon their extinction, the underlying thing (ayn) reverts to the estate of the testator.
