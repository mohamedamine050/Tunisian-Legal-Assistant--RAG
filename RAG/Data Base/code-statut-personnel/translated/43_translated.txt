(Amended by Law No. 42 of 1964 dated November 3, 1964 and Law No. 16 of 1980 dated April 3, 1980). - The deadline for reporting a death is three days. If the death is not reported within the legal deadline, the civil status officer may not include it in his registers except with the authorization of the **Court of First Instance** in whose jurisdiction the death occurred. This is to be concisely mentioned on the official death certificate. If the place of death is unknown, the claim shall be brought before the **Court of First Instance** in whose jurisdiction the **claimant** resides.  Whoever intentionally lies to obtain a **judgment** on the occurrence of a death shall be punished by imprisonment for one year and a fine of two hundred and forty dinars.
