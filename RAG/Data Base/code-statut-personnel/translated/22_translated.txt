A void marriage is automatically annulled without the need for:
*  Divorce.
*  Legal dissolution of the marriage by a court order. 

Such a marriage does not produce any legal effect whatsoever. However, cohabitation gives rise to the following consequences only:

*  The woman is entitled to the stipulated dower, or to a dower determined by the ruler.
*  Paternity is established.
*  The wife is obligated to observe the period of `Iddah (waiting period). The `Iddah begins from the day of separation.
*  Consanguinity is prohibited.
