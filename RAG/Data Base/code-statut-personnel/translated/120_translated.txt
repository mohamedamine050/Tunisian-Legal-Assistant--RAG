If a woman has no female heirs and her brother is an heir (asab), she does not become an heir (asabah) through her brother, similar to the relationship between an uncle and aunt, a cousin and cousin, or a nephew and niece. Therefore, the property goes to the male heir (asab), and his sister receives nothing from it.
