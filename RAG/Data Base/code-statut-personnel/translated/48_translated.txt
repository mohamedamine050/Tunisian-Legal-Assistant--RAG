If signs or indications of death resulting from violence or other circumstances raising suspicion are found, burial is not permitted until a police officer, assisted by a physician, prepares a report detailing the condition of the body and the circumstances surrounding it, as well as any information obtained regarding the deceased's name, surname, age, profession, place of birth, and residence. The police officer must promptly forward to the civil status officer at the place of death all the information contained in the report, enabling the issuance of the death certificate.
