The issuance of civil status documents concerning soldiers and sailors belonging to the State shall be governed by the preceding chapters. However, outside of Tunisian territory and in the circumstances referred to in this paragraph, the following authorities are authorized to receive civil status documents in all cases: 

1. In military formations, by the Commander of the formation.
2. In general commands or war staffs, by the military administration personnel.
3. By the Head of the Military Port, in relation to military personnel under his jurisdiction and prisoners.
4. In formations or health institutions belonging to the army, by those managing their affairs.

Within Tunisian territory, and in the event of a siege or mobilization, the above-mentioned authorities may issue civil status documents, but only when the functioning of the municipal services is completely disrupted due to circumstances arising from a state of war.

These authorities may, under the same conditions, issue civil status documents for non-military individuals who are within fortified places subject to siege.
