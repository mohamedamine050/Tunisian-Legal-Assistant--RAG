Brothers by the same mother have three legal statuses:

1. One brother inherits one-sixth of the estate.
2. Two or more brothers (including both males and females) inherit one-third of the estate, with an equal share for each sibling.
3. Their inheritance is nullified if there is a son, a grandson (regardless of how many generations removed), a daughter, a granddaughter (regardless of how many generations removed), a father, or a grandfather.
