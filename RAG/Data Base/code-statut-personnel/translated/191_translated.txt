Where a person dies leaving behind children, whether male or female, and their father or mother died before them or at the same time, those children are entitled to a testamentary bequest proportionate to the share they would inherit from their deceased father or mother, taking into consideration their death following the death of their said ancestor. However, this bequest shall not exceed one-third of the inheritance. These grandchildren are not entitled to the bequest:
* **If they inherit from the grandfather or grandmother on the side of their father.** 
* **If the grandfather or grandmother made a bequest to them during their lifetime or gave them a gift without compensation in the amount of the bequest.**

If the grandfather bequeaths them less than what they are entitled to, the remainder shall be completed. If he bequeaths them more, the general rules of bequests shall apply to the excess. The mandatory bequest takes precedence over the optional bequest. In case of multiple optional bequests, they are considered equal and are distributed proportionately if they conflict.
