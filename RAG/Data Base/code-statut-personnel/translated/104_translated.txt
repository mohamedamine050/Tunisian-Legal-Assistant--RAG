The daughters of the son, like the daughters of the father, have six scenarios: 

1. **One daughter** inherits **one half** if she is alone.

2. **Two or more daughters** inherit **two-thirds** if there are no daughters of the father. 

3. They inherit **one-sixth** alongside **one daughter of the father** to complete the two-thirds.

4. They **do not inherit** alongside **two or more daughters of the father**, unless there is also a son of a son (male) equal to them in number.

5. Or if there are descendants of the son who are lower in degree than them, then they are excluded (by the male descendants) and the remainder is distributed amongst them; the male receives a share twice that of the female.

6. The inheritance is **precluded** by the existence of a son of the father.
