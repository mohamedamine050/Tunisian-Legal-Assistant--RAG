A mother is entitled to three shares:

1. One-sixth of the inheritance if the deceased had a son, or a son's son, even if he is further down in lineage, or if the deceased had two brothers or more, regardless of whether they are from both parents, from the father only, or from the mother only.
2. She is entitled to one-third of the entire inheritance if the aforementioned relatives are not present.
3. She is entitled to one-third of what remains after the share of one spouse is distributed. This applies in two cases: one, when there is a spouse and parents; and two, when there is a spouse and parents. If, instead of a father, there is a grandfather, the mother is still entitled to one-third of the inheritance after the spouseâ€™s share is distributed.
