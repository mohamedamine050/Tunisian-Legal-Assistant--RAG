The father has three situations: 1) The obligatory share without agnation (asabat), which is one-sixth, and this is when there are sons and grandsons, however far down in descent they may be. 2) The obligatory share and agnation with daughters and granddaughters, however far down in descent they may be. 3) Pure agnation when there are no sons or grandsons, however far down in descent they may be.
