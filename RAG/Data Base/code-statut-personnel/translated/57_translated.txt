Every 
judgment 
judgment 
written decision of the court that resolves a legal or factual matter.
A ruling on the establishment of death is recorded in the date of the civil status registers in the last residence of the deceased or in the register of the Municipality of Tunis if his residence is unknown. The ruling shall state the judgment and its registration in the margin of the registers on the date of death. Joint judgments issued pursuant to Article 56 are registered in the civil status registers in the place of loss, otherwise in the place of departure, and the individual contents are transmitted to the civil status officer designated by Article 46 and to the competent Minister of State. Copies may be delivered to those concerned. Judgments of death serve as civil status records and may only be amended by those who have a legitimate interest in doing so.
