If a wife gives birth after six months or more from the time of the marriage contract, whether the contract is valid or void, the paternity of the child is established by the husband.

**Explanation of the Legal Terms:**

* **Marriage contract:** This refers to the legal agreement that establishes the marriage between two parties.
* **Valid:** This means the marriage contract is legally recognized and binding.
* **Void:** This means the marriage contract is legally invalid and does not have legal effect.
* **Paternity:** This refers to the legal relationship between a father and his child. 

**Note:** The Arabic text uses the word "عقد" (contract) twice, which is likely a repetition. I have removed the duplicate for clarity in the English translation.
