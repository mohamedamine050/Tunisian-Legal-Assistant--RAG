A female heir is considered to be "assisted" (i.e., her inheritance is supplemented) by a male relative in four instances: 1) the daughter, 2) the daughter of the son, 3) the full sister, and 4) the sister of the father.

1. **The daughter** is assisted by her brother, and they inherit the entire estate or the remainder, with the male inheriting twice the share of the female.

2. **The daughter of the son** is assisted by her brother and her paternal cousin who is equal to her in degree, without any condition. She is also assisted by the son of her son (i.e., her grandson) who is lower than her in degree, provided that she has no claim to the two-thirds share.

3. **The full sister or the sister of the father** is assisted by her brother and paternal grandfather, and he is considered her brother in the inheritance.
