If a woman leaves behind a husband, a mother or grandmother, maternal brothers, and a brother or more, then the maternal brothers and the brothers will share equally what remains after the husband's and the mother's or grandmother's legal shares are deducted, with no distinction between male and female, the full brother, and the maternal brother. If there are paternal brothers with the brothers, they shall be excluded.
