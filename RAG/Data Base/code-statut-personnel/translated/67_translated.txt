(Amended by Law No. 74 of 1993 dated 12 July 1993).- If the marriage is dissolved by death, custody shall be entrusted to the surviving parent. If the marriage is dissolved while both spouses are alive, custody shall be entrusted to one of them or to another person. In deciding this matter, the judge shall consider the best interests of the child. If custody is awarded to the mother, she shall have the authority to govern the child's travel, education, and the management of their financial accounts. The judge may entrust the exercise of guardianship to the custodial mother if the legal guardian is unable to exercise it, or abuses it, or neglects to perform the duties resulting from it in the usual manner, or is absent from his residence and his whereabouts are unknown, or for any other reason that would be detrimental to the child's best interests.
