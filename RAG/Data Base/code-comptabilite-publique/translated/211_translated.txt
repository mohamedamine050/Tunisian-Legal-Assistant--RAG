If the Court of Audit refuses to approve payments that have been made based on documents that do not legally prove the Stateâ€™s debt, the Minister of Finance, or the person authorized by the Minister of Finance, after consulting the relevant minister, shall consider what actions to take against the payee. The payee has the right to appeal the decision against him before the Courts of General Jurisdiction.
