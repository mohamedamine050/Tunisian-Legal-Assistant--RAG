No advance payment of funds from the State, public institutions, and local public communities may be granted, even if such payment is subject to deduction or settlement, except with specific authorization from the Minister of Finance or from any person authorized by the Minister of Finance for this purpose. 

Authorization to grant any advance payment on expenses that are usually paid from the budget of any of the aforementioned entities may only be given if it is granted on lawful expenses for which specific budgetary appropriations have been allocated and not yet used. Such advance payment shall result in the freezing of an equal amount of appropriations by the Public Expenditures Oversight Department and by the accountant responsible for disbursement.

This advance payment shall be settled within the time period specified in the relevant laws and regulations, or within a maximum period of nine months following its granting. If the beneficiary fails to reimburse the advance payment or to provide proof of its expenditure within the aforementioned period without a valid excuse, his/her account shall be debited with the outstanding amount.

It is not permissible to grant financial advance payments for operations outside the budget, except to public institutions or local communities, and only on condition that such advance payments are intended to meet their urgent financial needs.
