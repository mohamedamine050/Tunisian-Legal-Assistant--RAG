If the acknowledgment of receipt is separate from the payment slip, as in the case of delivering a receipt torn from a special notebook or the signature of the creditor on the list, memorandum, or contract establishing the right, the person concerned must sign again on the payment slip itself. This is because the discharge of the state from the debt cannot be separated from the order to pay it.
