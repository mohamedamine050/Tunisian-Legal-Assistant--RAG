Checks returned due to insufficient funds or any other reason shall have their amounts included by the accountant in a special account separate from the budget, designated as "Unpaid Checks." The aforementioned accountant shall demand payment of the check amount from the drawer, employing the same means and privileges applicable to the original debt owed to the state, which is considered inherent due to the check's non-payment. This shall be irrespective of any penalties established by general law in this case.
