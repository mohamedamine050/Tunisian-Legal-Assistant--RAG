The officers responsible for collection and disbursement are tasked with sending out orders related to the execution of the budget. To this end, they are responsible for collecting public revenues, verifying them, and authorizing their collection. This is done while taking into account the provisions governing payments that must be made promptly. They are also responsible for contracting expenses, settling them, and issuing orders for their payment to their beneficiaries. They may delegate their authority to assistant disbursement officers.
