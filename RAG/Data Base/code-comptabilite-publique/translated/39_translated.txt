No set-off may be made between debts owed to the State or a public authority and debts owed by it. Any exception to this rule must be expressly authorized by a decree. Anyone indebted to the State, a public authority, or a local community for taxes or other liabilities shall be legally obliged to pay the full amount due, without any right to seek set-off against any debts owed to them by these entities, even if those debts are supported by court judgments or enforceable documents.
