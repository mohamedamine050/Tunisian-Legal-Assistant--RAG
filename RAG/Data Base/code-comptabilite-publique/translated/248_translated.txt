(Amended by Law No. 86 of 1996 dated November 6, 1996). - The expenses of public institutions are paid according to the rules stipulated in Title II of this Code concerning the State budget. However, the value of materials or equipment purchased, work completed, and services rendered for the benefit of public institutions may be paid by a check drawn on the State Treasury or by a postal check. The check issued must be made out and non-transferable, drawn in the name of the rights holder claiming the payment, and signed by the accountant of the institution, acknowledging receipt without any reservation or condition, specifying the date thereof. In all cases, the accountant must refrain from paying the expenses of the institution if it does not have the necessary funds.
