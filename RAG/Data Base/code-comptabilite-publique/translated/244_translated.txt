Resources entrusted to the accountant for collection may be written off from his accounts if it becomes apparent that the claimants are unable to perform them. The accountant may propose the write-off after obtaining the approval of the institution's director and the advisory committee, if any. The write-off shall be effected by a "decision from the Minister of Finance, or from whom the Minister of Finance has delegated this authority," which shall be notified to the accountant.
