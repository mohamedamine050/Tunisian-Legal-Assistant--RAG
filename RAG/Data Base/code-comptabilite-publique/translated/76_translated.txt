Payments, dues, and public revenues are paid either in cash, by administrative payment orders, bank or postal checks, transfers to the current postal account opened in the name of the competent accountant, or by reliable electronic payment methods according to the current legislation governing electronic transactions (amended by Chapter 75 of Law No. 90 of 2004 dated December 31, 2004). They can also be paid by checks drawn on the State Treasury, subject to conditions set by "the Minister of Finance or his authorized representative."  Furthermore, certain revenues may be paid by means of promissory notes or bonds with guarantees, subject to the conditions specified in the laws or provisions governing the types of such revenues.
