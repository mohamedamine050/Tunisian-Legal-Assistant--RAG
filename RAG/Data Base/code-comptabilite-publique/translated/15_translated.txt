Public accountants are personally and financially liable for the operations entrusted to them, for carrying out the oversight assigned to them, and for safeguarding and preserving the funds, assets, products, and materials entrusted to their care. However, public accountants are not financially liable for errors made in the collection or settlement of taxes and levies they are responsible for, unless there is evidence of malice on their part.
