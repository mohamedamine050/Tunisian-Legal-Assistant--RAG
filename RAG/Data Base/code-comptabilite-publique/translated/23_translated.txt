**English Translation:**

Any person who undertakes collection or disbursement operations for a public entity without possessing the legal capacity to do so shall be considered a de facto accountant.  The actions of a de facto accountant are subject to all accounting rules established by this Code (1), and the same obligations and controls applicable to a legal accountant shall be applied to them.  They shall bear the same responsibilities.  Furthermore, the Court of Audit may impose a financial penalty on them for holding public funds without legal justification.  In addition, a de facto accountant may be subject to criminal prosecution and sentenced to the punishment prescribed in Article 159 of the Penal Code.
