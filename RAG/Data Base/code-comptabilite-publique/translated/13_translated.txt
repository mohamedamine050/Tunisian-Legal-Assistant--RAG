**(Amended by Law No. 111 of 1990 dated December 31, 1990).**  The General Accountants are divided into two categories: First Accountants and Second Accountants. First Accountants hold full authority in accounting matters and directly submit their accounts to the Accounting Department. Second Accountants, however, have their accounts collected and incorporated into the account of a First Accountant. General Accountants may delegate their authority to delegates acting on their behalf and under their responsibility.
