In the event of a deficit in the accounts of an accountant who is subordinate to another accountant, the latter, if it is possible for him to avoid the situation, may be compelled to immediately pay the amount owed by the former to the state or the relevant entity, granting him the right to step into the shoes of the state or entity with respect to its rights against the financial security of the aforementioned accountant or his assets. The provisions of this chapter also apply to public accountants in the event of a deficit in the accounts of their subordinate cashiers or payment agents.
