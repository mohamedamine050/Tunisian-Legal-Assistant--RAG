If the amount due to the heirs of the right holder does not exceed one hundred dinars, it is sufficient to pay them with a document issued by the Governor, the Mayor, or the District Governor, stating the names of the beneficiaries. No fees are incurred for receiving this document. The amount may be paid to one of the heirs if they guarantee the consent of the other beneficiaries to this payment.
