If a deficiency is found in the agent's funds, or if the agent fails to provide supporting evidence for certain payments, or if the agent fails to return any advances received, the "Minister of Finance, or anyone authorized by the Minister of Finance in this matter," shall issue a decision to replenish the agent's account. The Director General of Finance or the relevant accountant shall be responsible for pursuing the collection of these funds through a mandatory order. 

**Note:** The Arabic text provided includes a definition of "استخلاص" (collection). I have excluded this definition from the English translation as it was not part of the legal text being translated.
