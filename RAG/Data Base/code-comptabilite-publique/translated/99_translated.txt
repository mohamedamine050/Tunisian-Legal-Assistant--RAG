**(Amended by Law No. 106 of 1986 dated December 31, 1986).** All requests by the State for studies, works, transportation, services, and supplies shall be executed mandatorily within the framework of a written contract. However, it is possible to suffice with the submission of lists or memos in lieu of written contracts: 

1) For studies, works, transportation, services, and supplies that can be delivered immediately or within a short period, provided that the estimated value of the annual requirements does not exceed an amount to be determined by decree.

2) For studies, works, transportation, services, and supplies executed abroad for the benefit of diplomatic and consular missions under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, regardless of the amount.
