**Extraction**

Extraction is the process by which a creditor obtains payment of a financial debt owed to them by their debtor. This process is carried out through an administrative request following a notice to the debtor.  This request must be in writing, issued by the collector assigned to extract the debt, and served upon the debtor, either through the officials mentioned in Article 28 above or through administrative means if the debtor is a public accountant.
