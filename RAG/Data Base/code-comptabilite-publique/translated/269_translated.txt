It is not permissible to conclude a contract for municipal expenses without obtaining authorization from the Public Expenditure Control Department if the prevailing regulations require it. Administrative decisions of a general nature, not related to a specific individual, are considered regulations. Contracts concluded without such authorization shall be considered null and void and shall not be recognized by the accountant.
