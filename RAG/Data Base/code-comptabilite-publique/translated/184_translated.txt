**(Amended by Law No. 86 of 1996 dated November 6, 1996).** The General Treasurer also serves as the central accountant for the treasury. In this capacity, he manages the State's current account with the Central Bank of Tunisia and is responsible for consolidating, in his accounts, all operations, both budgetary and non-budgetary, that are directly carried out by State accountants under their responsibility. He also prepares the year-end accounts for the preparation of the State's annual general accounts. He is further responsible for reviewing the annual accounts submitted by the Regional Treasurers and certifying their conformity with their records before submitting them to the Court of Auditors by the end of July of the year following the year to which they relate. However, "the Minister of Finance or any person authorized by the Minister of Finance in this regard" may authorize the Central Bank of Tunisia to directly debit the treasury's current account to settle expenses related to public debt and the State's contributions to the capital of international institutions, within the limits of the authorized credits. The General Treasurer of Tunisia ensures, within the framework of his accounts, the settlement of operations related to direct debits.
