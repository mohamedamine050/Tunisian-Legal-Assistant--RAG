The annual collection of dues, taxes, and other public revenues is authorized by the financial law enacted for the budget. State revenues and the collection of its funds may only be collected by accountants appointed legally for this purpose and based on legal or regulatory documents. Any official or auxiliary staff entrusted with collection who undertakes collection without legal documents will be pursued judicially as a public funds embezzler.
