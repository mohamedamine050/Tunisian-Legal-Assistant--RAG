Municipal expenditures are contracted and their amounts are determined. The Mayor, as the authorized disbursing officer, issues the order for their disbursement. He may delegate, either temporarily or permanently, the authority or responsibility to another individual for the execution of specific activities. This delegation shall be made on his responsibility and under his supervision.  The delegatee shall be assisted, in a temporary or permanent capacity, by his assistants.

**Contract**

A contract is a legally binding agreement that obliges the contracting parties and defines their obligations and rights in relation to the specific transaction. 

The Mayor may delegate the responsibility for contracting and disbursing certain municipal expenditures.  Such delegation is effected by a decision recorded in the municipality's register and is revoked in the same manner. The delegatee must refer to the delegation decision in the documents related to the activities he performs in his capacity as a delegate.
