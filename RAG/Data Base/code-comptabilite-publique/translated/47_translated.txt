The period of limitation, which is the loss of the right to pursue a claim due to failure to comply with deadlines, is interrupted by any of the following:

1) The creditor's submission to the competent administrative authority of a request for payment of his debt or a complaint related to this debt. In this case, he shall receive from the head of the relevant administration a certificate of the date of submission of his request or complaint, along with a statement of the accompanying documents.

2) The filing of a lawsuit before the courts by anyone concerning the source of the debt, its existence, amount, or payment.

3) The issuance of correspondence relating to the debt by an administration concerned with the matter.

4) Payment of part of the debt. In such a case, the new period of four or five years shall run from the beginning of the financial year following the year in which the interrupting act occurred. If the interruption is the result of the filing of a lawsuit, the new period shall run from the beginning of the financial year following the year in which the judgment became final.
