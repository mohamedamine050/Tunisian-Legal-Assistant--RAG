The recovery of debts owed to the public treasury shall be effected by legal means through an execution order. The method of recovery is regulated by general administrative regulations specific to each category of such debts. In the absence of a specific method for other categories of debts, their compulsory collection shall be effected through a warrant issued by the Regional Treasurer referred to in Article 192 of this Code, in whose jurisdiction the office of the Public Accountant issuing such warrant is located, and such warrant shall be rendered enforceable. (Paragraph 3 of Article 39 of the Financial Code No. 7 of 2011 dated 31 December 2011 has been amended). Enforcement warrants shall be executed provisionally, and their execution shall not be prevented by any objection filed by the debtor.
