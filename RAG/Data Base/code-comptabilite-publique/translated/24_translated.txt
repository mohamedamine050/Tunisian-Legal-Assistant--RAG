The employment of taxes, whether established or not, that were not included in the budgets of the Treasury or in the laws and, where appropriate, regulations, is permanently prohibited. Any authority that imposes such taxes, any assistant who prepares collection schedules or sets their amounts, and anyone who collects them, is considered to have embezzled and will be prosecuted accordingly, regardless of disciplinary sanctions and regardless of the penalties provided by the law relating to the financial sanctions (2).  Additionally, the right to restitution, which may be exercised within four years following collection, against the collector, the officers responsible for collection, and anyone else involved, is not subject to any form of appeal.
