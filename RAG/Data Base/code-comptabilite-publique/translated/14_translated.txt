It is permissible to appoint agents to carry out collection or disbursement operations for the benefit of public accountants. These agents are appointed by a decision of the Minister of Finance or a person authorized by the Minister of Finance, upon a request from the head of the administration to which the service, institution, or local community in which the agency is established belongs. However, agents working in administrations with budgets subordinate to the state budget are appointed by a joint decision of the Minister of Finance or a person authorized by the Minister of Finance, and the Minister responsible for executing the subordinate budget. They are obligated to provide financial security and may not commence their duties until they provide proof of the aforementioned security or their membership in a cooperative insurance body.
