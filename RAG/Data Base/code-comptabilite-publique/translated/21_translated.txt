The liability of public accountants and their agents shall be established either by a judgment issued by the Court of Audit or by a decision of the "Minister of Finance or his delegate" or by a decision of the Minister in charge of the relevant budget for the accountants of that budget. The liability of the treasurer shall be established by a decision of the "Minister of Finance or his delegate" or by the Minister in charge of the relevant budget to whom he reports. An annual interest of five percent shall be added to the debt, calculated from the date of the event giving rise to the liability if that date can be determined; otherwise, it shall be calculated from the date of its verification. The collection of these funds shall be undertaken by the General Treasurer or the competent accountant. Judicial courts shall not review decisions ordering the establishment of liability against an accountant or an agent or a treasurer. However, such decisions may be appealed to the Administrative Court.
