Contracts shall be concluded only after competitive bidding, either through open or restricted tendering, or through a request for proposals. However, it is also permissible to conclude contracts by direct agreement. In this case, and as far as possible, such contracts shall not be entered into without prior public announcement and competitive bidding.
