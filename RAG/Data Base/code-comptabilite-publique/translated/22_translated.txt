The Public Accountants, Treasurers, and General Agents of the Public Treasury have the right to request partial or complete exoneration of their liability in the event of force majeure. They may also seek special exemption from paying the sums they are obligated to pay. In both cases, the Prime Minister shall decide on the request after reviewing a report from the Minister of Finance or a person designated by the Minister of Finance for this purpose.  In both cases, the amounts waived shall be paid from the budget of the State or the relevant entity.
