It is permissible, when necessary, to entrust the collection of dues, taxes, and revenues stipulated in the budget to collection agents. The establishment of collection agencies shall be done by a decision of the "Minister of Finance or the person delegated by the Minister of Finance for this purpose," upon a request from the head of the administration to which the service with the established agency belongs. The decision shall mandatorily specify the type of taxes authorized for the agent to collect, the methods of collection, as well as the methods of delivering the collected amounts by the agent. Collection agents shall not be permitted to engage in any pursuit against defaulters, as this task is the responsibility of the accountant for whom they work.
