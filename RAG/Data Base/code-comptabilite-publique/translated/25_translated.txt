No rights or debts owed to the State, a public institution, or a local public group may be relinquished except by law.

The law is a rule agreed upon by a competent authority that regulates the conduct of citizens and institutions.

The reduction in the amount of late payment penalties and follow-up expenses shall be granted according to the following criteria:

* Full exemption in case of payment of the principal debt and monitoring penalties within a maximum period of 3 months from the date of the first follow-up action following the **service** of the enforcement order;
