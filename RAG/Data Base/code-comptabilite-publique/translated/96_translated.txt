Salaries and similar emoluments shall be settled at the end of each month, and a month shall be considered as consisting of thirty days. Therefore, the monthly salary shall be one-twelfth of the annual salary, and the daily salary shall be one-thirtieth of the monthly salary. This latter portion shall be indivisible.

Similarly, lifetime allowances and periodic grants shall also be settled at the end of each month unless the laws and regulations governing them provide for their payment at the end of every three or six months.

In the case of workers' wages, a weekly, semi-monthly, or monthly statement shall be prepared, which shall include the number of days and fractions of days worked if the worker is paid a daily wage, and the quantities produced if the worker is paid a piece-rate wage.

Upon the death of a pensioner or a civil or military employee, the salary or pension shall continue to be paid until the end of the month in which the death occurred. In the event of an employee's discontinuation from performing his duties, his salary shall be paid up to the last day worked.
