The issuer of the payment order shall not be permitted to impose on the state any interest or other bank charges arising from loans or advances taken by the contractor to finance the works required by the contract. However, this does not preclude imposing on the contractor charges or penalties that were not included in the estimated lists submitted by the contractor due to their unexpected nature, and which cannot be attributed to the contractor due to his performance of the required works.
