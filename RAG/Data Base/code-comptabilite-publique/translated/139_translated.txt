The postal or bank transfer shall be effected by the competent accountant without the presence or signature of the beneficiary on the payment order. In this regard, the accountant shall merely record the number and date of the receipt attesting to the deduction of the amount from the government account balance with the Central Bank of Tunisia or the postal check attesting to the transfer. The accountant shall produce the documents delivered to him by the bank or postal check center attesting to the actual completion of the transfer. If the transfer is in favor of a public accountant, in addition to the above, the receipt issued by this accountant and corresponding to the amount transferred in his favor must be produced.
