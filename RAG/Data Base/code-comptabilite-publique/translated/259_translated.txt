The Minister of Finance, or any person authorized by the Minister of Finance to do so, shall, with respect to institutions not directly subject to the authority of the Court of Auditors, undertake the same tasks entrusted to the Court of Auditors.

Decisions rendered in this regard by the Minister of Finance, or any person authorized by the Minister of Finance to do so, may be appealed to the Court of Auditors.
