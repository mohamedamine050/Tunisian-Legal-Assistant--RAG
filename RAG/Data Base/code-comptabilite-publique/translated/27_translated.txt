**(The first and second paragraphs of Article 46 of Law No. 58 of 2010, dated December 17, 2010, have been amended.)** - Courts of Appeal are competent to hear cases related to objections against the writ of execution or objections against the extract copy of the collection schedule. The action is brought within a maximum period of ninety days from the date of service of the writ of execution or the extract copy of the collection schedule. The aforementioned courts are also competent to hear appeals against acts of service and other procedures related to the writ of execution and the extract copy of the collection schedule within the framework of the same lawsuits mentioned above. The objection must be reasoned and must include the designation of the case for a specific hearing before the Court of Appeal within whose jurisdiction the accounting center that issued the writ of execution or the extract copy of the collection schedule is located. The objection must also include the designation of the address of the objector in the city where the aforementioned court is located. The investigation of the objection is conducted in writing and without any argumentation by the presentation of written reports on the subject by both parties, which are communicated to the other party before being submitted to the court. While the engagement of lawyers in such cases is not mandatory, it is possible for the objector to present oral arguments personally or through an official lawyer. The judgment in the case is issued after hearing a report from the designated judge, which is read aloud in the public session after obtaining the opinion of the public prosecutor. The issued judgment is final and cannot be appealed against except by way of cassation. **(The last paragraph of Article 46 of Law No. 58 of 2010, dated December 17, 2010, has been repealed).**
