Administrative authorities are not permitted to waive the right of prescription in favor of the State, public institutions, or local communities. However, in special circumstances and for specific reasons, it may be possible to waive this right, partially or entirely, in favor of the creditor, by a decision of the "Minister of Finance or the person authorized by the Minister of Finance" if the debt is owed by the State or a public institution. The same measures apply to creditors of local communities, by a decision of the "Minister of Finance or the person authorized by the Minister of Finance," taken after obtaining the consent of the councils of these communities and the supervisory authority.
