The accounting of materials involves recording the movable and immovable assets owned by the state, including any transfers affecting them, as well as movable assets deposited with it, and items prepared for sale, such as publications, securities, tickets, tax stamps, and others. The Minister of Finance, or the person delegated by the Minister of Finance in this regard, is responsible for establishing the specific rules governing such accounting.
