If a defect is found in any disbursement order, the accountant must refuse to accept it and immediately notify the issuing authority concerned in writing, stating the reasons for refusal to endorse. If the issuing authority deems it necessary to override this refusal, they must immediately refer the matter to the "Minister of Finance or their delegate" for a decision. If the disagreement persists, the "Minister of Finance or their delegate" or the relevant issuing authority must refer the matter, accompanied by a detailed explanation, to the Prime Minister. The decision taken in the matter shall be binding on the accountant and relieves them of financial responsibility.
