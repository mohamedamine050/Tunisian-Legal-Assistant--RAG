(Amended by Law No. 115 of 1976, dated December 31, 1976) - Public accountants may perform collection or disbursement operations for private individuals, subject to conditions determined by the "Minister of Finance or his delegate." In this case, a portion of the amounts collected, ranging between five and ten percent, is deducted for the benefit of the state, institution, or local community pursuant to a decision by the "Minister of Finance or his delegate," as compensation for the costs of management, administration, and collection incurred in performing these operations. The deducted amount is recorded as revenue in the budget.
