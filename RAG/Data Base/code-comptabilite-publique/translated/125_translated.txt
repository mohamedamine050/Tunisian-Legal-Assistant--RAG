If a payment card is lost, the owner may be given a copy of it upon request, stating the reasons for the loss and providing a certificate from the competent accountant attesting that the card was not paid by him directly or by any licensed accountant authorized to pay the value of cards bearing his signature. The accountant concerned shall provide a certified true copy of the loss certificate and another certificate of non-payment to the drawer for him to keep as a justification for his actions, while the accountant shall keep the originals to attach to the drawer's file for the lost card.
