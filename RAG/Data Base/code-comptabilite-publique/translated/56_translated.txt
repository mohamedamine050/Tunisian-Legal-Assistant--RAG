Every public accountant in charge of funds shall have only one account in which he shall collect the funds belonging to the different services under his responsibility. He shall also have only one postal account. However, "the Minister of Finance, or the person authorized by the Minister of Finance in this regard," may authorize the public accountant to open more than one postal account for the purpose of carrying out and monitoring specific financial transactions. The procedures for opening, managing, and closing these accounts shall be determined by a ministerial order of the Minister of Finance. (Added by Law No. 101 of 2002 dated December 17, 2002).
