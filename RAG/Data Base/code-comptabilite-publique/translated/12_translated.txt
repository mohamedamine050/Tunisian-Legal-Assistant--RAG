(Amended by Law No. 91 of 1982 dated December 31, 1982).- No employee may be appointed to the position of accountant in funds or in materials, nor may he exercise his functions, unless he presents to the competent authority, in accordance with the legal procedures, a copy of his oath document.

The oath is an oath administered by one of the parties to the other party in order to settle the dispute between them, if the evidence permitted by law to prove his claim is lacking, resorting to the conscience, honor and religion of that party.

The oath must be administered in accordance with the legal procedures. The employee will be enrolled in the cooperative insurance for public accountants upon taking up his duties. This enrollment is mandatory for treasurers, collectors and expense agents as well. The conditions for enrollment in the cooperative insurance for public accountants will be determined by order.
