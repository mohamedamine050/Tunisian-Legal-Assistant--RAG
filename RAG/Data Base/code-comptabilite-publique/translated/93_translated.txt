The contract decisions are drawn up in accounting ledgers, which are held by the State's Expenditure Authorizers, the Public Expenditure Oversight Authority, and the designated accountants, each acting independently. These ledgers are maintained by these parties for each fiscal year separately and must be detailed according to the chapters, sub-chapters, and authorizations contained in that year's budget.
