Financial collectors are solely responsible for the collection of public resources, debts, and revenues generated from extraction documents issued by judicial or administrative authorities and recorded in their registers by regional treasurers. 

They carry out this collection on their own responsibility, either directly or through other public accountants acting on their behalf.

They are obligated to provide proof of full collection of these levies or to deduct them from their accounts within the prescribed legal timeframes.
