The amounts for which a disbursement order has been issued and paid in cash are daily credited to a special paragraph bearing the following heading: "Remaining Expenses Authorized for Payment." These amounts are detailed according to the years to which the debts pertain. These amounts are paid to their owners from that account by means of a payment slip issued by the disbursing officer and endorsed simultaneously with the disbursement order to which it pertains. The aforementioned payment slips are paid by the competent accountant or any other public accountant.
