It is not permissible to carry out any form of seizure,  the seizure which empowers the creditor holding an enforceable instrument to place the tangible movable property in the possession of his debtor under the authority of the court, even if it is pursuant to judgments or execution orders on assets, nor on debts arising from taxes, or any other debts, nor on securities, bonds, movable and immovable gains without any exception, owned by the state, public institutions or local communities. Any seizure and execution actions contrary to the above provisions are considered absolutely null and void.
