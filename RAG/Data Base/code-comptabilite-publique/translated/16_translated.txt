Public accountants are personally and financially liable for the actions of the staff working under their orders. However, the treasurer may be held financially liable for errors committed in the performance of their specific duties that the responsible accountant could not prevent before they occurred. The decision to impose such liability is taken by the Minister of Finance or by someone authorized by the Minister of Finance, based on a report by the head of the department to which the treasurer in question is assigned. Any employee who handles public funds, whether received as advances assigned to them or as a result of their position, is considered a treasurer.
