It is permissible to grant the owner of the contract installments or advances for the work, transformation, or supply performed by the contractors or subcontractors entrusted by him on his behalf, as if he had completed it himself, provided that the following conditions are met: 1) that such work, transformations, or supplies relate to materials, services, or products made wholly or partially that are part of the composition of the contract. 2) that the owner of the contract remains directly responsible for its completion and that he has transferred all or part of his debt to the State on these entrusted parties or contractors, within the limits of the price agreed upon by the contracting parties, except for a price exceeding or falling short of the price agreed upon in the contract. 3) that the State has approved the entrustment of these contractors or subcontractors and that these parties undertake toward it with regard to the work they perform, the same obligations or commitments of the entity towards third parties in exchange for obtaining goods, services, or loans from them. It is permissible to stipulate in the terms of reference that certain work within the scope of the contract, whose price is individually determined, shall be considered, in terms of payment, an independent contract.
