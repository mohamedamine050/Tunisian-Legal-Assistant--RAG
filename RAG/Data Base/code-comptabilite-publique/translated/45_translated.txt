(Amended by Law No. 88 of 1997 dated December 29, 1997).- The Public Accountant shall secure all amounts deducted from salaries and wages, and generally any amount whose payment has been stopped with him pursuant to:

* **Attachment:** The attachment empowers the creditor holding an enforceable instrument to place the tangible movable property in the possession of his debtor under the authority of the court; 
* **Opposition:** Opposition is a remedy available to the defaulting party to overturn a decision made in his absence; 
* **Transfer, Assignment, or Conveyance:** This occurs when the Public Accountant endorses payment orders.

An **insurance** contract obligates the insurer to pay the insured or the beneficiary a sum of money, a regular income, or any other monetary compensation in the event of the occurrence of the insured event, in return for premiums or any other financial payment made by the insured to the insurer. 

The aforementioned insurance fully discharges the debt of the debtor as if the insured amount had been paid directly to the rightful owner. The relevant Public Accountants shall deduct 3% of the insured amounts held by them for the benefit of the State budget under the heading of management and expenditure costs. The nature of the attachment and opposition subject to the aforementioned deduction shall be determined by a decision of the Minister of Finance.
