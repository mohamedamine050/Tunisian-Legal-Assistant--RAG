The State and public institutions, for the purpose of collecting their debts from third parties, enjoy a general privilege over the movable and immovable property of their debtors. This privilege holds the rank prescribed by the Real Rights Code. Local communities also enjoy the same general privilege for collecting their debts, but in case of conflict, priority is given to the State.
