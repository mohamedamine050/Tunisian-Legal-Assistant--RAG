Disbursement orders are dated and numbered annually by each ministry, sequentially for each budget chapter.

Disbursement orders specify the name, title, and nickname of the beneficiary, if applicable. Collective disbursement orders may be issued for certain expenses.  Collective orders do not have a specific number, but are referenced by the first and last numbers of the transfer notices or payment cards related to them.
