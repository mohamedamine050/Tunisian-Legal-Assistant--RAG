The lack of renunciation of Tunisian nationality is established by presenting a certificate issued by the Secretary of State for Justice to anyone who requests it, certifying that the declaration of renunciation was not submitted or that its registration was refused. 

Renunciation of nationality refers to the legal and political bond between an individual and a specific state, which includes the individual among its constituent population. Consequently, this bond establishes reciprocal rights and obligations between them.
