A child born to a Tunisian parent, pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, is considered Tunisian from birth, even if the legal conditions for granting Tunisian nationality are not established until after birth. However, in this latter case, the attribution of Tunisian nationality from birth does not affect the validity of legal acts issued by such child, nor the rights acquired by others based on their apparent nationality.
