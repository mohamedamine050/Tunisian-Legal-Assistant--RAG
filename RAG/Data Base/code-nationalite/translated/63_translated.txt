**(Amended by Law No. 12 of 1971 dated March 9, 1971)**

**Nationality**

Nationality is a legal and political bond between an individual and a specific state, which includes this individual among the population that constitutes it. This bond consequently establishes reciprocal rights and obligations between them.

The Tunisian nationality certificate is issued to anyone who requests it and proves they are a Tunisian national. However, with the exception of the Governor of the Tunis District, diplomatic and consular representatives of Tunisia abroad, as well as the Governors of the regions residing in their respective jurisdictions are also authorized to issue the aforementioned certificate, upon proof of nationality.

**Applicant**

The Applicant refers to the person who has taken the initiative to commence the legal proceedings.

The issuance of the certificate must be in accordance with the provisions of Articles 6 to 10 of this Code.
