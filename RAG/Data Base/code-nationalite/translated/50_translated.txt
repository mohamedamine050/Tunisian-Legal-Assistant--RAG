If, before a Court, a Court where litigation between the parties takes place, which is a civil court subject to the judicial authority, which must have its independence within the three powers of the state, a challenge is raised based on Tunisian nationality or foreign status, then that Court must set a deadline of thirty days for the initiation of a case before the competent court of the person who raised the challenge and for the Public Prosecutor if the person claiming Tunisian nationality holds a certificate issued to them pursuant to Article 63 et seq. of this Code. The penal court shall suspend its proceedings until the matter of nationality is decided or until the expiry of the set deadline in the event that no action is taken.
