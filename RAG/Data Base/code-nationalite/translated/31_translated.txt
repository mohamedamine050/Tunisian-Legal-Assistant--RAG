## Loss of Nationality 

Nationality is a legal and political bond between an individual and a specific State, which includes that individual within the population constituting that State. Consequently, this bond establishes mutual rights and obligations between them.

Under the provisions of the aforementioned article, the loss of Tunisian nationality can apply to minor children who are not married, and to the spouse, provided that they hold another nationality. However, it cannot apply to minor children unless it also applies to the spouse.
