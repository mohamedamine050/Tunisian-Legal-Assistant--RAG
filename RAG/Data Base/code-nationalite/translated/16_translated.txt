And in the event that the President of the Republic does not object within the time period specified in the preceding paragraph, the matter shall be considered as though the person has not acquired Tunisian nationality.  Article 16, in the circumstances set forth in Articles 13 and 14, considers the woman as if she had not acquired Tunisian nationality if the judgment annulling her marriage was rendered by a Tunisian Court whose judgment was not subject to any form of appeal, or by a foreign Court whose judgment became enforceable in Tunisia.
