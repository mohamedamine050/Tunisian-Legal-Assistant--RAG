The Attorney General shall, upon request, take charge of the administration of any case, including any case involving a claim related to Tunisian nationality, that has been brought before a court, which is a civil court within the judicial power, an independent branch of the three branches of government.  The court shall suspend the proceedings pursuant to Article 49 above, and any request arising from this must be included in the case file. If the Attorney General does not receive legal aid, he must secure sufficient funds, as determined by the Attorney General, to cover the costs of the case and any fine that may be imposed upon him.
