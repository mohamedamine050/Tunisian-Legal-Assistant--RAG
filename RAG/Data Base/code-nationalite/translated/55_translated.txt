If, in a purely incidental manner, the issue of nationality is raised before the Court of First Instance, the Public Prosecutor must be brought into the case in all its aspects. The Public Prosecutor is obligated to submit reasoned observations.

The Court of First Instance is generally the first court to examine the dispute and render a decision. The Court of First Instance is a court where litigation between private parties takes place. It is a civil court that falls under the judicial authority and must be independent within the three branches of government. 

The Court of Appeal, competent to examine civil matters between private individuals, must consider the issue of nationality, which is a legal and political bond between an individual and a specific State. This bond brings the individual into the ranks of the population constituting that State. Consequently, this bond establishes mutual rights and obligations between them.
