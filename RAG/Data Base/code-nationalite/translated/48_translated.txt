The **Court of First Instance** is generally the first court to hear and decide a dispute. 

It has exclusive jurisdiction over disputes relating to Tunisian nationality and hears these disputes in its **civil** sessions. 

Its judgments are **subject to appeal** and the **action** is to be brought before the Court where the person whose nationality is in dispute resides, or the Court where the plaintiff resides, if the person in question does not have a place of residence in Tunisia.
