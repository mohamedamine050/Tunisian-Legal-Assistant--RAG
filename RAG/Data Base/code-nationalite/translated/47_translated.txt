The orders issued regarding naturalization in Tunisian nationality, its loss, deprivation, withdrawal, or the government's opposition to its acquisition are published in the Official Gazette of the Tunisian Republic. They become effective from the date of their signature, without prejudice to the validity of legal acts issued by the concerned person and the rights they acquired before the date of publication, on the basis that the concerned person was a foreigner in the case of naturalization, or on the basis of their Tunisian nationality in other cases.
