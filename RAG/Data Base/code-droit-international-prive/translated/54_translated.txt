Inheritance is subject to the domestic law of the state of which the deceased held nationality at the time of death, or to the law of another state of which the deceased was a resident, or to the law of the state in which the deceased left property. If the law applicable to the estate does not assign property located in Tunisia to an heir among natural persons, then such property shall devolve to the Tunisian state.
