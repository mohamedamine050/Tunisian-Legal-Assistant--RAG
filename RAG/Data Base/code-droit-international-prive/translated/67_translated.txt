The contract of employment is subject to the law of the state where the worker habitually performs his work. If the worker habitually performs his work in several states, the contract of employment is subject to the law of the state where the employerâ€™s establishment is located, unless it is apparent from the circumstances that the contract has closer ties to another state. In this case, the law of that state shall apply.
