The Tunisian courts shall have exclusive jurisdiction to hear and determine the following matters:

- 1- Where the subject matter of the **action** [1] [2] concerns the **attribution**, **acquisition**, **loss**, **withdrawal**, or **revocation** of **Tunisian nationality**.

- 2- Where the **action** [1] [2] relates to **real estate** located in Tunisia.

- 3- Where the **action** [1] [2] relates to **collective proceedings** such as corporate rescue or bankruptcy.

- 4- Where the subject matter of the **action** [1] [2] concerns a request for a **preliminary or enforcement measure** in Tunisia, aimed at assets located therein.

- 5- And in any other matter expressly conferred upon them by law. 

**Notes:** 

[1] **Action:**  This is a more concise and legally precise translation of "الدعوى" as it encompasses the concept of a legal claim or lawsuit.

[2]  The phrase "[1] طلب أحد حقه من آخر في حضور القاضي؛ ويقال للطالب المدعي وللمطلوب منه المدعي عليه  [2] الدعوى هي الحق الذي يعود لكل ذي مطلب بأن يتقدم به إلى القضاء للحكم له بموضوعه. وهي بالنسبة إلى الخصم الحق بأن يدلي بأسباب دفاع أو بدفوع ترمي إلى دحض ذلك المطلب" is a complex definition of "الدعوى."  For clarity, I have broken it down into two notes:

    -  [1]  This first part emphasizes the nature of a legal claim, where one party (the **claimant**) seeks to enforce a right against another party (the **defendant**) before a judge.
    -  [2]  This second part expands on the concept of an action, explaining its legal and procedural implications, including the right of both parties to present evidence and arguments.  

This translation maintains the legal terminology, uses consistent terms for repeated phrases, and follows the original sentence structure for clarity and accuracy.
