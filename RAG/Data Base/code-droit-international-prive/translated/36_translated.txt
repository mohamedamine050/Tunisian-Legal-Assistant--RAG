The judge shall raise the issue of public policy regardless of the nationality of the parties to the dispute.

When applying public policy, only those provisions of the foreign law that violate Tunisian public policy in the sense of private international law are excluded. The judge shall apply the provisions of Tunisian law in place of the provisions of the foreign law whose application has been excluded.
