The formal requirements of marriage are subject to the personal law common to both parties or to the law of the place where the marriage is contracted. If one of the spouses is a citizen of a country that permits polygamy, the civil status officer or judicial official may not solemnize the marriage unless a formal certificate is presented proving that such spouse is free from any other marital ties.
