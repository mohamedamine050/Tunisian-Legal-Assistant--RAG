The capacity to act is governed by the personal law of natural persons. As for legal entities, it is subject to the law of the state in which they carry out their activity. If one party in a financial obligation possesses capacity according to the law of the state where the obligation was entered into, they cannot claim incapacity or lack thereof under their personal law or the law of the state where they were established or carry out their activity, unless the other party knew or should have known about their incapacity or lack thereof at the time the obligation was entered into.
