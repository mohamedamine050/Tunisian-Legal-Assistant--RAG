**Custody** 

Custody of children refers to the legal arrangements concerning the responsibility and care of children following the separation or divorce of their parents. 

Custody is subject to the law under which the marital bond was dissolved, the child's personal law, or the law of the child's residence. The judge applies the law that is in the best interest of the child.
