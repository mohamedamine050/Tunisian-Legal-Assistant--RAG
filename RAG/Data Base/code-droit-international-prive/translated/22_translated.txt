Tunisian courts apply the immunity, a legal privilege granted to certain individuals (government officials) recognized by both national and international law. This immunity enables them to perform their duties without restrictions or pressure, including legal restrictions.  This immunity applies even in cases where the foreign state or legal entities, as referenced in Article 19 of this Code, are not present in the proceedings.
