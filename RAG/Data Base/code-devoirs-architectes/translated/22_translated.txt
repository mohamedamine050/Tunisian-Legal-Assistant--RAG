Neither an architectural consortium nor an association can practice the profession of an architect. The consortium or association cannot be registered on the Architect's Register. 

An association is an agreement between two or more persons who work permanently to achieve goals, excluding the pursuit of profits. The architectural consortium or association is not subject to any form of appeal.  The professional liability for the professional work performed by a partner architect within the architectural consortium or association shall be borne by all its assets.
