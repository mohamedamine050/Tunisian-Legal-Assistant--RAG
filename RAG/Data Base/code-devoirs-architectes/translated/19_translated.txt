Every architectural complex project or participation in a complex must be submitted in advance to the Authority for verification of its compliance with the provisions stipulated in this Code. Architects may not undertake any complex project before the Authority's decision, which shall be communicated to the concerned parties within a maximum of one day following the deposit of the file. The same procedures apply in the case of a change in the conditions of participation in the architectural complex, and the concerned architects must inform the Authority of any event that may terminate their participation.
