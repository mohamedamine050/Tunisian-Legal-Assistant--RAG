The architect shall disqualify himself if he is appointed as an expert or arbitrator in a case where one of his colleagues is a party, and the case relates to a work performed by him, or to a case in which he has expressed an opinion on the essence of the dispute. 

If he is appointed by his colleague, he must consider himself no longer his consultant, and his duties shall henceforth become the duties of an expert or arbitrator.
