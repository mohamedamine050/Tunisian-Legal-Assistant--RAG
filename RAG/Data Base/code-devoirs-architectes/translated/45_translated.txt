The architect must, under all circumstances, maintain complete independence from contractors and material suppliers. The architect must not forget that his/her remuneration is solely for services rendered or in the form of a fee. Therefore, it is strictly forbidden for the architect, in any capacity whatsoever, to solicit or accept any commission or benefit, directly or indirectly, from third parties. A direct benefit is considered, in particular, to be allowing contractors or material suppliers to perform studies that are normally within the scope of the architect's duties.
