If multiple architects collaborate on the construction of the same project, the services should be clearly defined upfront at the commencement of the studies by a written agreement. This agreement shall specify the remuneration of each architect and the method of its disbursement. Collaboration should be conducted in a spirit of cooperation that serves the interests of the project. The architects shall inform each other of the studies and any useful instructions for the work of each. Each architect shall perform their services with the same care they would exercise if they were solely responsible for the project.
