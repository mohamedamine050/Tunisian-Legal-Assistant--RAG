If an architect is compelled, due to force majeure, to continue the services of a project, as stipulated in Articles 7 and 39, which was initiated by a colleague, he must inform his colleague and obtain a legally valid authorization from him. In case of a legal dispute between the two parties, recourse to arbitration before the Council of the Architects' Association is mandatory, as it becomes the sole competent body to resolve the dispute. In all cases, the first colleague shall be compensated for the services he provided.
